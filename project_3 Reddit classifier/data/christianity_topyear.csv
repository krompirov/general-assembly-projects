PHall16,0.0,1935.0,"This was so offensive to me as a Christian.

Jesus Christ was mocked, ridiculed, and protested every step on the way to the cross. He did not fight back, call for violence or attack his protestors. Jesus taught loving your neighbor, service, and sacrifice.

The President ordered an assault of teargas and rubber bullets on the lawful and peaceful protestors so he could make a spectacle of walking to a building where he does not worship and hold up a book he does not preach. No amount of policies or judicial nominations is worth this.

Intotherosegarden1,0.0,1886.0,"I am a Christian, but I've always been a bit skeptical about modern medical miracles. I believed miracles were reserved for the early church, when the apostles were still living.

Well...last night at around 10:30, God proved me wrong.

For over 10 years I've suffered with a crippling condition called TMJD, which is dysfunction and inflammation of the jaw joints. It causes severe chronic pain and prevented me from chewing solid food during moderate to extreme flares. It causes lockjaw, so I could only open my mouth a finger's width, two fingers on a good day. Every time I just barely *moved* my jaw a millimeter, my joints would crackle and cause shooting pain. When I opened my mouth--not even chewing or talking--my joints would CRACK CRACK CRACK like someone stomping through gravel in my skull or snapping bones in half. I lived in constant pain even while remaining perfectly still. I'd done long-term therapy, taken medication, but nothing worked. The only (if temporary) solution is botox injections into the masseter muscles, but I couldn't afford that.

On top of that I have bruxism, which is tooth-grinding or clenching. I've chipped teeth and had to sleep with a mouth guard. Bruxism can cause the masseters to be overworked and swollen. Mine were so big they felt like tennis balls and I looked like a chipmunk with stuffed cheeks. The inflammation, soreness, and tension made it difficult to concentrate on anything else, ever.

1/3 of my life I lived like this.

So last night, things were so so bad, my head felt like it would burst, I just started crying, lowered my head, and said, ""Jesus, please take this pain awa--"" 

I didn't even finish the sentence when it happened.

For over a decade, I'd felt like my face and head were tensed and contorted by thousands of bands pulled unbearably tight--they snapped loose INSTANTLY. Every muscle relaxed so fast it felt like my face was melting! The pain was just GONE. I remember jerking my head up and my eyes flew open. I was in shock, blinking at my closet door for about 30 seconds. Then a little afraid to believe, in case it was too good to be true, I carefully moved my jaw side to side. No cracking. I barely opened my mouth--now I could open wide!! My face felt strangely hollow, like a deflated balloon. I was shaking and reached up to feel. My masseters had shrunk back to normal. I'd been malformed for so long I didn't remember what normal felt like.

Thank you, Abba, Father, for hearing the cries of the least of your lambs, the brokenhearted and broken-bodied. You see us, and by your grace allow us glimpses of you, that we may be reminded that our present suffering is nothing compared to the glory you will reveal to us one day!

Last night was the first night in 10+ years that I didn't clench my teeth. I woke up today totally loose and relaxed, pain-free, refreshed--healed.

We don't always know God's plans. Maybe he allowed me to endure these conditions just so one day I would write this post, and it might help just one person in their faith :)",Christianity,MIRACLE: Jesus cured my disease last night!,1886.0,0.88
ChristianConvertHere,0.0,1889.0,"Hello everyone, Christian or not, family or not, friend or not, but a neighbor at the end of the day. 

Today, my grandson introduced me to Reddit and I learned how to set it up and use it. Although, I may run into issues so please don‚Äôt mind me, I am old lol. To start off, I was raised in a Catholic household at a young age in the Bible Belt of the USA. I used to be a firm believer in Christ, bible, church, resurrection, everything. Then, after turning 16, around this time of the year, I started getting very skeptical. When I mean skeptical, I am talking about hours after school continuously questioning and contemplating in my head on whether or not god exists. Then, I became Atheist. It was about 54 years ago so it‚Äôs hard for me to remember but it wasn‚Äôt gradual or subtle, rather, I became Atheist in a matter of weeks. This was also fueled by 2 of my other friends who became Agnostic and Atheist (1 was Agnostic and another Atheist) a few months prior to my conversion. I remember going to their houses and talking with them about the existence of god only to go deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of Atheism. So, to conclude on that part of my life, I became Atheist.

I started getting into secular philosophies. I went to the library, I had to search very hard. I read books and even went to Atheist seminars to strengthen my Atheism. Basically, I was not just the type of Atheist that went ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no god, whatever, I‚Äôll go on with my life, if you‚Äôre religious, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù... No No No, I was the type that would go ‚Äúthere‚Äôs absolutely no daddy sky fairy, you‚Äôre dumb and indoctrinated if you believe in those fairytales, let me show you why Atheism is the real path to truth‚Äù. My Anti-atheism was heavily inspired by my friends and by my reads. The fact that religion caused so many wars, issues, etc. These were my reasons for being anti-Theistic and I believe Theism and Christianity were harmful and cancerous for everyone of its followers.

Looking back at my old self, it is toxic. I am ashamed and I pray for forgiveness from God. Now, this is when my Atheism clearly went too far... I got a tattoo with the Atheism symbol. Yes, that‚Äôs right, at I believe 37 or 38, I decided there‚Äôs no better way to embrace my Atheism now that I lived in a different state (not inside the Bible Belt) than to get a tattoo on my shoulder. Looking back at my foolish, pathetic, and laughable young self, I am unruled by it. Now, I am getting it removed with a laser in about 4-6 weeks. And I will use those scars as a proud reminder of my conversion. So from age 16 till a few months ago, I was a hardcore Atheist and Anti-Theist, my wife who was Presbyterian hesitantly converted to Agnosticism after I would not leave her alone about God and Atheism being the ‚Äútruth‚Äù. Now, I don‚Äôt know why she didn‚Äôt leave me for being the annoying prick I was at the time but God has his ways. For the most part, I was okay, never really happy, satisfied in my work, and always the type of guy who looked forward to his alcohol at night.

Conversion precursor. My retirement was later than many my age. I have always taken care of my body since youth so my work was never really inhibited until about 6 months ago when I had serious back issues. That‚Äôs when I decided to quit and retire for good. Now, I am bored at home with quarantine, nothing to do, the kids can‚Äôt see me anymore nor the grandkids, my wife and I have nothing new to say lol, I am bored like never before in my life. That‚Äôs when my Atheism and Anti-Theistic thoughts sprouted back in my mind. Now of course, I always thought about them but as of the past decade or so, they weren‚Äôt as important anymore. Yes, I still carried around my proud Atheist tattoo, but otherwise, not over powering. 

Now stuck in quarantine, I decide ‚Äúfor once and for all, now that I have nothing to do, I am going to prove Christianity wrong, I will destroy this book of nonsense‚Äù. And just like that, I ordered a Bible from amazon and read it. The Old Testament felt fake to me at the time, so I read the New Testament. That‚Äôs when something clicked in my head and I said to myself ‚ÄúRegardless of how much I hate Theism and think this is all gibberish, it still deserves an equal opportunity. Besides, I will still debunk it regardless‚Äù. So I read it, I did this for a good 2 hours daily. That‚Äôs when I started getting curious. Now with my old age, I felt less anti-Theistic and I felt that was more of an edgy young phase, not something someone my age would do. Now with the internet, I started YouTubing videos on the resurrection, I watched both debunking videos and pro-resurrection videos. I began to seriously wonder if maybe this is the truth. That‚Äôs when I wrote down all my objections to Christianity and the resurrection. I then typed them all in. I got results for all of them believe it or not (the Internet is amazing). I watched them for hours daily. I remained immensely skeptical. Theistic metaphysics is what set my Atheism into flames. After many many many weeks of doing this daily. Quarantine plus retirement plus curiosity can do this lol. So for the first time in 54 years, I prayed, I prayed agnostically and asked god to please show me something of validity of his existence. I expected nothing and thought ‚Äúwhat a dummy I am‚Äù.

Weeks later, my wife goes to the emergency room for a very bad UTI, the antibiotics given days prior were found to be resistant from the bacteria. My wife who is 73 was rapidly deteriorating and the doctors said it might be too late. I prayed to God just for the sake of it to heal my wife who is still Agnostic but not really involved in theology at all. Next you know it, 3 days later, she is out of the ICU with no permanent bladder damage. I asked the doctors ‚Äúhow‚Äù, the doctors said something to the extent of ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know exactly, all we know is that your wife was on the brink of sepsis, but the cultures for bacterial resistance came just an hour prior to her becoming septic. And the antibiotic that worked, it was the last one the pharmacy had left‚Äù 

Now yes, it could be a coincidence but it is important to note how my wife, at the brink of death was saved miraculously. This made me question God. That‚Äôs when I took the Bible seriously, no longer a book of jokes, this is a book I need to know proved God existed. I read and read, hours flew like they never existed. I finally said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way for there not to be a God‚Äù. That‚Äôs when I said, okay, God exists (of course, I researched heavily into apologetics, evidence, etc) I looked into other religions, Islam, Judaism, none compared to mighty Christianity. My kids, all Agnostics were shocked to find my conversion. After weeks of contemplating. I CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY

Now I don‚Äôt know what denomination, I‚Äôm searching, but after 54 years of lies and Atheism, I am now in the truth, Christianity and god‚Äôs undeniable existence. This is a long post. Sorry for making it so long. There might be errors, I apologize. Today is my 70th birthday, I got baptized today and I am so excited. May God bless everyone here.

Iamindeedamexican,0.0,1702.0,"All, I apologize if this sort of post is not allowed, as I‚Äôm new to this sub but I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot. This last Friday I was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer called Ewing Sarcoma. I had a surgery about a week ago to remove an abscess in my right humorous and after running tests it was found to be cancerous. At only 25 years old it was a bit of a blow. My wife and I are both strong believers in our Lord Jesus Christ, but it still shook us. The doctor believes he caught it early and that I should do well (saying 80% of patients do just fine with the chemo treatment, with this type of cancer). I‚Äôm going in for a full body scan hopefully this week and we‚Äôre just praying that it hasn‚Äôt spread, and that the treatment can start soon (especially amid all this pandemic craziness). 

To any who are willing, please pray for healing in my life, and peace and a lack of fear for both me and my wife. I know that we should rejoice in our sufferings as it produces endurance, character, and hope but sometimes it‚Äôs just difficult. I love my wife dearly and it‚Äôs also very hard seeing her cope with the possibility of losing me (and we‚Äôve only been married for 3 years). Thank y‚Äôall in advance.

Edit 1 (6/21/20): 
I cannot thank everyone enough for your prayers and well wishes. My wife and I read every single one and we were legitimately moved to tears. Thank y‚Äôall so much for your love, support, and prayers, I can‚Äôt tell y‚Äôall how much it means. It really helped and uplifted us to know there are many out there praying. As some have expressed interest I will gladly continue to edit this post to provide updates. As I was only diagnosed a few days ago, it may be a week or so before I know the plan but I will edit as soon as I find out!

Edit 2 (6/23/20): 
I saw the doctor this morning and it‚Äôs definitely going to to be a tough journey. They are running tests to make sure that it is 100% Ewing Sarcoma before they start treatment as well as if it has metastasized at all (hopefully not). From there it‚Äôs going to be 9-12 months of chemo (and all sessions of chemo must be done in the hospital). It‚Äôs 3 days in for one 2 week session and 6 days in for the next 2 weeks and it just alternates like that. I will more than likely have to quit my job and my wife who has been going to school is going to have to put her education on hold (or cancel all-together). We are talking with a fertility specialist on the possibility of freezing my sperm due to it more than likely not being viable after chemo. There‚Äôs just so much to process and we aren‚Äôt sure how we‚Äôre gonna do it, but I know God will provide. Thanks again for y‚Äôall‚Äôs prayers and if y‚Äôall would continue that would be much appreciated. We have a tough journey ahead. God bless!

Edit 3 (6/30/20):
Thank y‚Äôall for y‚Äôall‚Äôs continued prayers! I finished all my tests and the both the PET scan and the bone marrow biopsy came back negative with any cancer spread (praise God)! We had been specifically praying for no metastasis of cancer and God faithfully provided! Regardless of metastasis or not, my treatment is still the same, but it‚Äôs still just a great feeling seeing examples along the way of God answering our prayers and starting this battle with much better odds. We also received the final pathology reports confirming with certainty that it is Ewing‚Äôs Sarcoma. I believe the plan is to start chemo some time next week, so please continue to pray for peace and strength for what‚Äôs to come (for both me and my wife)! I can‚Äôt express my appreciation enough for everyone‚Äôs prayers! I will continue to update as my journey proceeds! God bless, y‚Äôall!

Edit 4 (7/11/20): 
I just got back from my first chemo treatment and it wasn‚Äôt too too terrible. I still feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù and slightly nauseous but they gave me some pretty good meds that work well. Like I‚Äôve said before it‚Äôs going to be a long bout of chemo (9 months to a year) so I will keep the updates on this post to a minimum and just mention important milestones. But thank y‚Äôall so much for your support and prayers! I will say I‚Äôve received many complements about how well I‚Äôve held up and how positive I‚Äôve been and I can honestly say it‚Äôs all the Lord. Through Him I am sustained and I can see this just completely changing my walk with Christ for the better!

Edit 5 (9/11/20)
I got that comment and thought it would be a good time for an update! I‚Äôve been undergoing chemo for about 2 months now, and so far it hasn‚Äôt been too terrible. I‚Äôve read many stories of people having a terrible time through chemo with side effects, and I really have been coasting through, so I count myself blessed. I have ocasional fatigue (I actually had to get a blood transfusion due to low red blood cell count), some indigestion type side effects, and maybe ocasional nausea and that‚Äôs really about it. I also didn‚Äôt think it would matter to me, but it was definitely a tough ordeal losing my hair. Once it happened I guess it made it more of a reality. It was tough on my wife as well (for the reality check as well,she loves me regardless of my looks haha) but I think we‚Äôve gotten over that and used to the new look now. The next step right now is surgery. So the tumor is in my right upper humerus and they‚Äôre going to be basically cutting off the top half and replacing it with either an allograft (cadaver bone) or titanium. We learned from our new surgeon that the previous surgeon may have contaminated the tissue and he might have to remove a good amount of muscle in my right arm. Also if there is any visible cancer contamination, they will have to do radiation, which will rule out the allograft, because apparently that won‚Äôt heal correctly. The allograft is better though because my body will accept it a bit more and I‚Äôll have more range of motion. However, regardless of the type of replacement, I will only ever be able to lift about 5 lbs with my right arm. So that was a bit of a bummer, but hey, If all goes well I‚Äôll be cancer free and living, so I‚Äôll take it. The surgery is tentatively scheduled to take place on October 7th. Once that happens, they‚Äôll probably wait a few weeks and then the second half of my chemo will start (6-9 months to make sure no microscopic bits are left). I will say though, that the surgeon looked at an x-ray recently and noticed the tumor looked like it was receding and giving good margins for the surgery. So praise God for that! So for all who read this, if you could please pray for continued recession of the tumor and that I can hopefully get that allograft replacement rather than the titanium. Thank y‚Äôall for y‚Äôall‚Äôs interest and support, I really do appreciate it!

Edit 6 (10/7/20):
I‚Äôm not sure if people get notified for updates on this post but I just wanted to post a quick update and prayer request. My surgery to remove the upper portion of my humerus bone is actually this afternoon in a few hours (I believe at 12:30). We are very blessed that the surgeon was able to go the route of using the cadaver bone rather than the titanium which is better recovery and more range of motion. If whoever sees this could just pray for peace and calmness for my wife and also for knowledge and steadiness for the surgeon. They have to remove some muscle so we‚Äôre hoping that they don‚Äôt need to remove too much when they go in there, and also they have to disconnect and reconnect a main nerve so pray that that goes well also. Thank you all for your continued prayers and support! I will post an update after the surgery when I can actually use my phone haha

Edit 7 (10/20/20)
The surgery went really well! They were fortunately able to save the axillary nerve so that was really nice. While in the surgery the surgeon noticed more active tumor than he realized so he had to remove more muscle than he originally planned. This was a bit unfortunate but in my opinion I just want whatever is best for my overall outlook. After the surgery the main concern was the pathology report on the tissue remaining, they wanted to see if they got clear margins. We got the results last Wednesday and they were negative for any cancer cells, so that was just fantastic to hear. In addition we found out that the cancer cells had a rate (if that‚Äôs the right word) of 99% necrosis. The PA said anything above 90 is really good and 99 is the best you can get (it‚Äôll never be 100). Essentially this is a measure of how well the chemo is performing at killing the cancer cells, and in my case it is performing very very well. It also shows a better prognosis overall as the cells are more likely to be completely eradicated by the chemo and less likely to reoccur. I have been in my sling for 2 weeks and it‚Äôs tough but I can use my wrist and fingers just fine so I manage. Fortunately I‚Äôm left handed, so that makes things a bit easier. The plan forward is to get the staples removed in my right shoulder, and then get cleared for chemo. Then I‚Äôll have 6-9 more months of chemo and be done with treatment! It‚Äôs all downhill from here, its just a matter of getting through it. We‚Äôve had nothing but great news and we‚Äòre thankful to God for everything. I appreciate those who‚Äôve prayed for us, God really seems to be answering all our prayers.

Update on our situation: So, my parents are in a small prayer group from our church.

Edit: I feel like a need to clarify what I meant just a little bit... Jesus died the most painful death imaginable for everyone in the entire world, even the ones that will reject him and scorn him. My comparison between that and wearing a mask was that we can ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù for 15 minutes in the supermarket wearing a mask if we do what Jesus said and love our neighbors. I didn‚Äôt make this post to negotiate the effectiveness of masks or if coranivirus is real or not. I made this post to say we are called to be like Christ and Christ called us to love our neighbors and one way to do that is to wear a mask. Even if you believe it does nothing it may give someone else peace of mind and that is also loving your neighbor. I‚Äôm done reading comments about how it‚Äôs fake or masks are ineffective. I posted this to say we need to love our neighbors and treat others the way we want to be treated.

Last edit: I understand that in the USA wearing a mask has become a political issue. Is the virus bad... yes, is it being blown out of proportion by one side and then being under valued by another... yes. Is that a happy medium... no. Is a government mandated mask thing a slippery slope to mandatory vaccines and micro chip under your arm to prove it... maybe, idk. (I don‚Äôt disagree with vaccines, I am not anti-vaccines). Was my title probably wrong... yes. Would a better one be ‚ÄúJesus called us to love our neighbors, so let‚Äôs wear a mask‚Äù... probably. The one thing I am sure of is that elderly people are at higher risk for the virus and if wearing a mask may save someone‚Äôs life I think Jesus would do it as well.

I had nothing but confirmation today to solidify my faith in The Lord that has been building over the past few days. I had a very intense panic attack last Friday which led to a few unrecognizable thoughts that I accepted as my own, when they truly weren't. I called out for God last Friday, out of faith to come and save my soul and fix me in his image. 

Now I'm not exactly sure how this works but I am happy that he literally saved my life last Friday and tonight, while praying, he saved my soul. I'm excited to walk knowing he is watching after me because he loves me and accepted where I was, and led me to the light. 

The overwhelming peace and serenity feeling that I was having while I was crying was INTENSE LOVE. I was praying for him to save my soul because if he doesn't I was going to kill myself and as I cried out for gods help I then suddenly had 100% faith in him to take control of this situation that devil has me in, and deliver me. I heard a very loud yet subtle voice whisper SURRENDER. So I got on my knees, and asked him to save me because I was so lost that I was about to let the devil win. ""Forgive me for I have sinned and save my broken soul, please help me right now God"".  

HE. DID. JUST. THAT. 

I am so excited to walk this new path with him. Im new to understanding God and Christianity as a whole. I did however, just buy THE WORD OF GOD and eager to get to dive deeper into God and understanding his love and grace.

I'd harbored extreme resentment for him my entire life since. My anger at how he'd taken my mother from me consumed most of my thoughts. I couldn't move forward and I couldn't stop thinking about him and what he'd done.

I was never religious growing up, but three years ago I met a guy who was, started dating him and hanging around his family. I saw the attitude they had (welcoming, forgiving, happy, smiling, laughing) and decided I wanted to be like them. So, I started accompanying my boyfriend to church to learn more about Jesus Christ and the gospel. It put things in perspective for me and made me change my mindset on a lot of things.

October 17, 2018 I was baptized. His whole family and my dad were there for it. I accepted Jesus as my lord and savior and with it all my resentment went away.

Status_Macaroon3835,0.0,1526.0,"I come from a very broken home. My mom was a drug addict who couldn't hold work. My siblings and I each had a different dad and I bounced around constantly from staying with my dad to aunts and uncles to friends and everywhere. I didn't have a role model or a strong leader guiding me in the right direction at any point.

Naturally I fell in with a bad crowd. By the time I was 16 I was hanging out with gang members and drug dealers who were in their 20's. Eventually that progressed into me doing drug runs and sex work for them for money. It was the only time I'd ever felt like I belonged somewhere and I didn't want to leave. I didn't realize how deep I was in.

I rose through the ranks of this crew when it came to dealing. I got trusted with higher and higher quantities of supply and cash. The sex work became more frequent too, both for gang members and clients. Eventually they began bringing me along on strong arm robberies and we committed several over the course of about a year before one day we finally got caught.

I was 21 when I was arrested. None of my ""friends"" bothered to bail me out of jail or testify on my behalf at all. I was sentenced to eight years inside. I was 22 when the sentence was handed down. I got out when I was 30.

Prison life was more monotonous than anything. I never really feared for my life or safety while I was inside. I just had a lot of thoughts and not enough time to occupy them. I had become friends with a girl on my cellblock who was a Christian, and she would tell me how important it had been to her to pray and read the scripture, and I became interested.

So every day I started reading the Bible. I checked a little pocket version out from the prison library and paid to keep it long term by doing laundry and janitorial work. Every day I would just read and pray and read some more and I couldn't believe how at peace it made me feel. I could just feel God watching over me and guiding me. He had forgiven me for the awful sins of my past and had given me salvation. I was baptized in prison when I was 27. It's one of more impactful days of my life.

I got out of prison in February 2015. I was 30. I managed to convince my sister to let me move in with her. I had some work to do to convince my family that I was a changed woman. I found work as a private tutor and French teacher but I still want to get involved with the ministry in a more formal way. I want to preach the gospel to kids from broken homes like me and get them on the right path before they end up like me.

While out celebrating my birthday in December 2017 I met the most incredibly guy. He was handsome, he was a gentleman, he was funny, and I could not stop looking at him. We chatted for a couple hours that night and he asked me out on a date for the next weekend. He's also a Christian, and I know that God put him in my life because he's meant to be there. 

We found out last summer we were expecting our first child and he proposed on that day. Our son was born in February and he is a perfect angel. The ultimate gift from God. What a perfect angel our baby boy is. My fiance is an incredible dad and I just cannot thank God enough for putting them both in my life.

My life can be divided up into chapters: Before accepting Christ and After accepting Christ. The person I am now is completely different. I've left my life of crime in the past. I've changed for the better in every way. I talk to my mom about the scripture when we talk now because I want her to know it isn't too late for her to turn things around. She still struggles with addiction and is constantly in and out of drug rehab.

soswinglifeaway,0.0,1491.0,"So I'd like to preface this by saying I am not really looking to debate why I feel homosexuality is a sin or isn't compatible with Christianity. The debates have been had 1,000 times on this sub alone. You can guess which scriptures have led me to this conclusion, and I've heard the counter arguments. So far, my view on this remains unchanged. That isn't really what I am looking to discuss.

I live in a fairly conservative area, and a lot of people who I am friends with or am acquainted with who consider themselves  Christians try to vote through a biblical lens. They feel that because they are a Christian they must vote against things like legalizing gay marriage, because homosexuality goes against their religious beliefs. I personally do not feel it is our duty, or our right, to impose our religious views upon the world through legislation.

I see a lot of people who identify as Christians who believe homosexuality is a-okay and therefore support gay rights through legislation. I see a lot of people who identify as Christians who believe it is sinful, and therefore vote against this kind of legislation. But I don't come across many people like myself who personally feel that it violates their religious beliefs, yet do not feel compelled to vote against this kind of legislation.

I liken it to if a Jewish person tried to impose legislation on the rest of us to make eating non-kosher meats illegal. Just because it violates their religious views, it does not mean that the rest of us should be legally compelled to be held to that same standard. I think this is the kind of thing that falls under the separation of church and state, which I believe in. 

So this is why as a Christian I feel I can support LGBT rights and believe homosexuality is a sin, but not be a hypocrite.",Christianity,"I personally feel that homosexuality is sinful/not compatible with Christianity.

Some are just lonely, and others are also cold, hungry, and living in the streets.  I don‚Äôt have kids, but I would love them unconditionally if I did.

I am 25 years old. I have a Christian Family and my Gf's Family and her as well are ali very Christian. But not me. I Always defined myself as agnostic but would get into discussions trying to discredit Christians in debates etc.. I've changed since that and learned to respect all beliefs but still agnostic and thought there was Nothing science couldnt explain. 

Well... last year we found that my gf was pregnant but her amniotic sac broke with 13 weeks of pregnancy, so the baby probably wouldn't survive. My gf was very Strong and held up really well during that time, drinking a lot of liquid and she spent 50 days at the hospital for monitoring. When she was around 30 weeks the doctor said the baby lungs were too small and it would be an issue. Well, my daughter was Born within 32 weeks of the pregnancy, had to spend 1 month in ICU but her lungs were fine! The doctor later Said the chances of her survival were close to none. Now she is almost 1 year old and is the cutest and happiest baby I have ever seen in my life. 

Another ocurrence that happened to me one of these days was that I should have been killed in traffic, but something strange happened. I was going home from work, and I have to drive through a big highway, and I got sleepy at around 100 kmh. When I opened my eyes there was heavy traffic in front of me and I stepped in the breaks but my car lost control and started spinning. There should be a lot of cars around me but this time there were none. As the car stopped, I saw there were no cars behind me, and only in front of me, so I didnt crash into anything. Then, the cars started to show up behind me only after that. It was a miracle. 

But I was still skeptical. 

Now for about a week or so, I'm feeling depressed and very anxious about the purpose of life and my role in this world, and that after I was dead there would be the end and I would never see my daughter again. So I was very sad.

I decided to take a bath tonight to cool my head and looking at my celphone I decided to google ""how to have faith in god?"". One of the steps was basically to introduce yourself and pray and etc. So I went into the bath, closed my eyes and did Just that. 

I said that I was Sorry for not believing for 25 years and that I am Sorry that I still have my doubts but I am willing to change and Will do my best. Suddenly I felt something that I swear I cannot explain and started crying, but I was happy and not feeling depressed anymore. I don't know what happened but I was feeling great. That was God, I think. 

So I said the my gf that after this pandemic I Will go to church with her, as well as studying about christianity. This is my story! Thank you if you read it all of it. I Just really wanted to share my experience with someone.

Improve the adoption and orphanage system (This is where faith based organizations can really excel).  Teach people to love women who are pregnant out of wedlock even if we disagree with their sin.

SkepticalBrooo,0.0,1197.0,"Long story short: I was born in a catholic/orthodox family then later on developed my own opinion on religions and started to see them like some sort of delusion. Hearing my mother talk about Christianity sounded like fiction and kinda cringe. I hate to be this person but she sounded ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù.

After losing faith and officially viewing religion as something false that humans created to fear a lot less about the unknown, I entered an existential depression that seemed to never end.   I kinda developed a nihilistic attitude towards life and was very pessimistic about everything. I was at my lowest points for several months. 

I tried finding solution like turning to spirituality. I noticed that spirituality was a lot talked on the internet and saw it everywhere. ‚ÄúBecome your own God and make your own reality with the law of attraction‚Äù. Basically you think in a negative way you will attract that negativity and think in a positive way and you will attract that positivity. 

Me, the depressed human I was back then. I tried to think positively but still felt incapable, hopeless and so alone. I needed SOMEONE to pick me up from that dark place and rescue me. My heart never sat right with spirituality and decided to come back to Christianity. God finally called me. Since my last post about my pornography problem, I took everyone‚Äôs advice and asked God to release me from this addiction. 

I was saved. I can‚Äôt believe after years of having this problem, being a very sexual person... touching myself do not cross my mind anymore. I now view sex like something so intimate and powerful that has to be done in total privacy away from the world‚Äôs eyes. Porn now disgust me. I deleted twitter, there was lots and lots of girls promoting their OnlyFans and someone who viewed this like something normal and making ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù. My mind changed on that.
I still do not judge those people. On the contrary I want to pray for them. I want Jesus to save them.

A couple of days ago I prayed and I felt something. So powerful. I felt something in my heart, I can‚Äôt really describe it. It‚Äôs like something lives in my heart if that makes sense? During my prayer I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I went to the washroom crying like a baby. Came back to my room crying a third time. There was something new in me. THIS was the experience I wanted to experience for a long time. Everytime  I speak about God to my mother I start crying. I‚Äôm still overwhelmed. My prayers that felt empty years ago now I feel like there‚Äôs someone listening to them! I feel someone. God is POWERFUL.

I do not feel depressed and hopeless anymore. I feel accompanied in my life journey. The more I pray the more I have stronger Faith in our Lord. 
I noticed also that I‚Äôm a LOT less angry, I cuss less and most importantly I‚Äôm calm. God offered me his serenity. A gift that I will carry with me all of my life.

In this journey, I (22M) met a christian girl (18F) in my gym and after talking for a few days, she said she wanted to date with me. The days passed and she started to ignore me and I felt bad. Things got worse, because after a heart break my addiction come back.

So, I decided to change my life in 2020. In 12.31.2019, I gave my soul and my body to God and I promised that I would be a better person and connect to God more often by bible reading and praying.

I relapsed to porn a lot of times this year, but I always ended up asking for forgive me and I continued praying and reading the bible. **After so many persistence, in 269 days I managed to read a bible edition that has +1500 pages!** Right now I'm a few days without any explicit image or video, and I feel God gave me strenght to destroy my addiction.

NelsonMeme,0.0,1181.0,"As many of you know, Pope Francis habitually has a left-leaning stance (see the examples below.) I intend to show, however, that this recent rightward shift is actually healthy.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Pope_Francis_South_Korea_2014.png

Notice how Pope Francis has his left shoulder down in this photo. His weight is clearly on the left foot, as is to be expected.

https://c.files.bbci.co.uk/E854/production/_98967495_b9a07fe1-736f-433e-ae93-25484c90d8fc.jpg

The same thing is true here: His Holiness, whether sitting or standing (I can't tell,) has his left shoulder down, indicating more weight on his left side.

https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pope-francis-bolivia2.jpg

Same again here.

However, recently Pope Francis has been seen putting his weight on his *right* foot, rather than his left. Take this example from September:

https://www.catholicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/custom/2020-09-23T092724Z_814206838_RC294J9QXCCW_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-POPE.jpg

Don't be deceived by the dipped left shoulder, the crucifix he wears is showing how gravity is aligned, and it is clear that his weight is on his right foot.

The reason this is good is that the NHS in the UK says that ""hip-hanging"", or the practice of allowing one hip to sit lower than another is a common cause of lateral hip pain, something Pope Francis would likely be more susceptible to due to his age. While the ideal would be a balanced stance, it makes sense to me that not always favoring the same leg would at least be better.

My dad tested positive for Coronavirus today, and he's already been going downhill. He is overweight and diabetic, but I love him nonetheless. 

He seems somewhat fine, but with covid, things can get bad quick. I cant have him die. He came by to get h ik a suitcase because he is staying at his bosses 2nd house, and I saw my rough, tough love, usually annoyed dad cry. I watched as he drove away as he cried his eyes out. 

I'm 13, and he is the only income we have. If he dies, well lose the house, the cars, everything. I cant handle this much stuff at once. 

How he got it makes me mad. Real mad.

His coworker whom is known to not be the smartest, went to work, while he was sick, on steriods, and was waiting on a covid test result. He gave my dad the virus.

I cant do this anymore. I was already depressed, my best freind is moving away in a week, and now my dad has covid. 

Please Pray For Him.

I love you dad

Edit 1: WOW! Thanks for all the great feedback and prayers. My dad is doing fine, he says it has gotten better after he ate some pizza lol. My siblings and my mom are all getting tested at 1 PM, so pray for my family as well if ya could. God is great! Thank you guys so much!

Edit 2: Again, my family nor I could ever thank you guys enough! My dad has been doing well, and actually has been doing better. I think he was doing worse yesterday due to the shock and how he got it(I will keep how he got it private because lawers might get involved). I just got tested and it didnt hurt a bit. It tickled tbh. I get my results from the test anywhere from saturday to monday. Again thank you, and please pray that my test c ok mes back negative because school, and Halloween is next week and it's my favorite holiday:)

As food for thought - many people seem to substitute a Living Christ with a safe, quiet Jesus who fits into their church and beliefs. Becoming so obsessed with having the right theology or style of worship, that Christianity becomes a kind of salvation club.

This mentally is what the book of James confronts head on - when admonishing people to not let a rich man sit at a table while forcing a poor man to sit on the ground. Making sure both have a seat is following Jesus while going after the favor of the rich man is not.

I was taking at the peak of my addiction 10 .1 molly everyday and smoke herion on top of it. for close to 2 years it was bad. than for another 2 years I was on and off various drugs but high 24/7 nonetheless. Well fast forward to 2016 by now I quit the ""hard"" drugs and picked up drinking. This is wear my life really turned for the worse. A pint of vodka a day turned into a bottle a day within less than a year. I was drinking a bottle a day to a bottle and half for 3+ years, Everysingle day. One should say it was a suicide mission because most people I knew didnt know how I was still alive and neither did I. I did OD a few times during my addcition. But what I didnt understand before I know now. Gods plan for me was much greater than my own. I say this because about 3 months ago I prayed for gods forgiveness realizing the devil was in full control of my body. I prayed for him to rid me of my demons, I promised him I wouldn't harm my body anymore with drugs and only do what he what's of me.

JoeB-123,0.0,1049.0,"When I was in college, there were many who were sent by God to try to help save my soul, and some of them were called 'Campus Crusaders For Christ.'  And they almost succesful, but I guess that I had WAY too much childhood abuse to recover from, until I could feel comfortable amongst all of those 'bubbly' Christians that I had just met.  So I went off on my own and tried to solve my problems with drugs, I got into a bad marriage, etc.; but, then I met my current wife...my gift from God and a truly wonderful woman, who helped me to heal.  And although I didn't know it, God was right there all along watching over me, so that I didn't get into any more trouble that what I already had gotten into.

As I had drifted for my whole life, I had tried to trust in my feelings for spiritual fullfillment, but that never ever got me very far.  Then, members of a cult called 'Heaven's Gate' killed themselves, my son was about to be born, and I asked myself: ""what was my purpose in this life anyway?""  I could not understand how so-called 'Christians' could kill themselves, and if my son had ever asked me WHY it was wrong to hurt people, I would have been unable to answer him.  I also had this INCREDIBLY empty feeling deep inside my heart, and I knew that I needed spiritual fulfillment..AND PRONTO!  (Later on, I realized that the Heaven's Gate cult members were not Christians after all.)

So I was compelled to read God's Holy Bible on March 31, 1997, and God reached down to me.  Every word that I read from the Bible that night EXPLODED off the page deep into my heart, and as I gave my life over to Jesus, I began a process of repentance, forgiveness and purifying my soul that has not stopped to this day!!  AND I pray that it NEVER will and that I will ALWAYS experience the peace and passion of God's Love in my heart, now and forever!  Amen!  Thank you Jesus!  I love you so, Jesus!!

God bless you all who post here and are reading this now, and may His light shine down upon each and every one of you and keep you safe from harm...especially you younguns.  Keep the fire of Jesus burning brightly in your heart for others to see, OK!?  Take it from one who has MADE the mistakes: you don't need to experiment with the dark side of life AT ALL, because Jesus can save you from ALL of the suffering that sinning can cause.  And for those of you who like to witness to non-believers: if I can be born-again at age 40, then ANYONE can!  It's NEVER too late!  Good luck in all of your ministering the Word of God to everyone that we meet every day.  God bless....

I'm now living as a man, celibate until I can find a female partner, if God wants that for me. Through Christ's teachings I have learned to love my manhood, and now I am attracted to women. I still have an attraction to men, but I've noticed it lessens the more I own my manhood. I've come to understand my homosexuality as a perversion of self loathing and poor upbringing.

Needless to say, I feel *very* lost. I get the sense that my kind of transformation almost never happens, especially in modern times. I feel unable to be understood.

I deeply want to be a father. Adoption is fine with me, if I can find a partner.

I feel somewhat confident in my ability to love and make love to a woman. I have never done so before, but I've masturbated to the idea recently. I know I can *love* a woman, though. I can love anyone. Christ has taught me how. He teaches me every day.

Do you think a woman would ever be interested in me? I've taken great care of myself, all things considered. I know I will need to do a lot more work as far as establishing a career, but that is in progress.

Will you give me advice on how to proceed? I have only been Christian for 2ish months. I have so much to learn. But having a relationship with God is better than anything I've ever experienced before.

I would assume that most of us reading this have access to healthcare, food, water, shelter, and any other ""necessities"", along with a life of excess which provides us internet, expendable money, and other luxuries. If God gave us breath, we should live a life of worship.

This quote came from a missionary speaking to my pastor one day... He was trying to impress that in more impoverished areas of the world, people hold on to His Word. Most live lives of commitment to His name and keep Him in their heart all the waking hours. Although someone may only have 100 dollars to their name, they would give 75 to their neighbor to help with medical expenses or food. If we believe the Scripture, we know that God thrives in the hearts of the weak and the oppressed. People in these countries have felt God's love, they know that there is something way better than their current situation. They know, that the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, Jesus Christ, died for them so that they could one day reign in paradise. Sure, their worldy situation sucks today, but life is not about air condition and video games. They are rich!!!! Their Spirit is full and alive with the breath of the Holy Spirit!. Life is worship, and worship is life. They hold on to this truth, and they have some of the best relationships with God, as evidenced by their spiritual hunger and desire to be with the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit!

This quote really hit me in the chest. We,  Western Christians, have access to everything we could ever need to better the world. We have the ability to radically change peoples lives. I have the ability to talk to countless Christian followers through this post. I could go on for hours, but I honestly have limitless resources. Do I use those, on a daily basis, to live, spread, and try and teach the Word? No, I am ashamed to say. I absolutely do not. I would rather indulge in worldly desires such as video games, shopping for myself, and doing other things that make me happy.

How terrible is that? We have been given limitless resources to try and change the world, but we have become so engulfed in ""Me"", that we do not even realize what ammunition we have. God has sharpened our swords and given us the armor to fight for him. I use His Sword to crack beers. I use the Spiritual Shield to shelter myself from the rain. I put on the Lord's Armor to keep myself warm.

Today I will do better. I will start using my resources to help the world... to promote change.

I call myself agnostic but a better term is probably ex Christian, which I feel is probably much harder for Christians to deal with because we have 'known the truth and chosen to reject it'. I know I never knew what to do with them as a Christian.

To give you some context, I am not new to Christianity. At all. I grew up in it and believed with all my heart. I had been filled with the spirit, spoke in tongues, knew my identity in Christ. I wrestled with questions about hell, morality and death, went through extremely hard times and never forsook him or denied him once.

So what came next was unexpected.

In my late twenties I began questioning what I believed from a logical and historical perspective, not just an emotional one based on untested assumptions. This was coupled with an unwelcome doubt I couldn't shake or pray away.

This questioning and subsequent lack of convincing answers led me to deconstruct and eventually deconvert, despite the things I had previously experienced. The illusion shattered. The Jesus I knew didn't exist and I had been simply been brought up to believe one religion out of many.

I grieved and still do in some ways because I'm not sure I believe yet.

I didn't post this to say I was coming back to Jesus because some people on Reddit were nice to me, I still have many doubts to reconcile outside of this platform, but more to say that being civil with people like me who may come across as aggressive is more helpful than it may seem. I know that if I had been met with 'you never really believed' or something suggesting I just don't want to see God and it's my fault, then that would have likely just pushed me further away.

I just want the truth.

I had an offline conversation with one of you and summed up how I feel there - I miss Jesus terribly. I just don't know if he's real.

khizee_and1,0.0,979.0,"(Warning) Possible ongoing scam in Islamic Subreddits

 Salam Alaikum,

I just want to warn people of a **possible** ongoing scam going in some Islamic subreddits. 

There seems to be a weekly post on Islamic subreddits about somebody asking for duaa because of tough financial situations.  These are usually very sad circumstances described that naturally make us want to help. 

The first one that I have read about 3 weeks ago was basically a Muslim man asking for duaa because he was in the brink of committing a crime to feed his family, due to financial struggles related to Covid19.

I felt some type of way about it and decided that I would help.

Eventually, after talking to him, I discovered multiple red flags that prevented me from sending money :

1- The account is new and only has that specific post.

2- He immediately knew a way to transfer money from a company (worldremit) even though he has no relative that he knows outside of this country (Nigeria)

3- I believe he posted the same post on ¬´ Christianity ¬ª subreddit; the post was removed but I was able to see the comments and they were basically sending him prayers and lifting his spirit up. 

4- At the end, just to be sure, I pretended like I knew someone in Nigeria and asked him if it was okay for that person to deliver food for him. He was not for it because he did not want to bother anyone else. 

Every now and then, I keep seeing similar posts but with different accounts. The last one that I have seen was yesterday and it was a man asking for duaa because he did not have the money to pay for his daughter medical fees.

I decided to message him to see if it was possibly the same person.  

It seems like it is: The account his new and only has that specific post, he is from the same country (Nigeria), he wanted me to use the same company to transfer the money (worldremmit) and he couldn't provide me with the bill that showed the need of that 300$ requested by him.

Could it be just a pure coincidence? Possibly.

I was really reluctant on making this post because Allah knows how much we should help people if they are really in need but scammers often prey on emotions and vulnerability. If it is a scammer, giving him money is just going to give him more incentive to keep going while there are some people out there who are really struggling. 

**Please, the only purpose of this post is to remind you to minimally investigate before sending any money to strangers.**

[deleted],0.0,977.0,"So, I was just a regular person or so I thought, I lived a good life with a well paying job, a wife and a dog. I felt pretty safe in my day and enjoyed many of the things that other people enjoy, like movies, restaurants, watching youtube, riding my bike. The real problem was that, behind my apparent happiness which felt real I was struggling with an addiction that was destroying my entire life and my relationships without me even realizing it. My addiction was porn and masturbation, and it affected my life up until 3 months ago where I finally was able to stop watching porn and masturbating completely.

I was raised Catholic in a nice family. I attended church every Sunday as by my parents will. However, I was never really able to what faith was and to be honest I never really experienced God's love in my life. To me it was just a routine to please my parents, a boring one hour Mass that I attended up until I was 16 when I was finally able to make my decision to leave.

For the next 17 years I haven't put a foot in a church, or went to confession, I never prayed, maybe if I wanted to ask the Lord to help me get the job I was interviewing for, maybe one Hail Mary said badly every other year or so.

At 32, I was married, with a nice job, a loving dog and all the thigs I could dream about. I really felt like my life was going well, but was so I wrong!!! Especially in the last year of my married life, thigs were not going well, my addiction to porn and masturbation was getting worse. I was really not in control but I didn't even realized how much it was affecting my life and my relationships.

I was so oblivious to everything that was going on in my head that looking back, only now, when I am finally free from it, I can't believe how low I could go and how so normal it felt back then, isn't porn just a normal things in our lives? Doesn't everyone watches it? How bad can it be? Does it really affect anyone but myself? Those were my believes.

I really tough I was not addicted to porn, but where should we draw a line? I also felt like it only affected me and nobody else, and it was nobodies business to know or to even comment about it. Even my wife knew I was watching porn and she thought it was ok, I guess I haven't told her how much it was ruling my life and or relationship. On my part I was not really interested to stop, it feels so good after all, and there are no problems related to it, right? It's not life drugs or alcohol that ruin your health, masturbating is almost necessary, maybe even a good thing some people say.

Well let me tell you, I was so hooked I didn't want to see the problems and was far from being able to stop anytime soon.

I reached a point where my porn addiction was really driving my day, I remember waking up and really looking forward to watch porn. At times I was really hoping my wife would leave the house so I could have my pleasure time. I got to the point were I watching porn almost anywhere, at work, in public places. The drive was really high and could not really stop myself, as soon as the thought came up I was rushing to somewhere quiet and start watching porn.

My sex life was normal, or so I thought, I remember I was starting to get anxious if my wife was interested in sex because if that same day I had watched porn, my libido was down I didn't really feel attracted to her too much. I was basically at the point where porn was way nicer than sex with my wife, way more interesting and captivating. And could it not be? With a click I was able to pick and choose my partner, any style or perversion was right there in front on me for free. Nothing wrong right? everybody does it!

The more I masturbated to porn, the more distant I grow from my wife and she started taking notice. Mostly she felt unsecure about her body, she felt she was not attractive enough to turn me on, and she felt like it was all her fault. Our relationship started to be more and more cold, more and more distant and this led to some big fights. However the fights were not about porn but about the stress and the hanger that it was creating in me when I indulged into it.

At some point, like many other times I decided to trying quitting or at least reduce the influence it had on me. This time I was reading that cold showers cold be of some sort of help, so I gave it a shot and like many other times it lasted about 3 days, after which I went right back at it. I guess it was not effective, and how can it be? If you don't wanna stop, cold showers won't really help you.

I remember I then switched to prayers, being raised catholic in my childhood I thought I would give it a shot. I promised myself to at least say 3 Hail Mary before I would start jerking of, that too didn't really work immediately, I was still doing it, but slowly I started noticing some signs around me that got my attention. I remember that sometimes, before opening my laptop and going on my favorite porn website, by pure chance, my mom or a friend would send me a message on my phone, or maybe a call would come and catch my attention. At the beginning I didn't really spent too much time thinking about it, but after a few times it had happened I start wondering if this could have been some sort of a message from ""above"". To many of those coincidence started to pile up and I started to take notice.

The moment that really changed everything, was the moment were I started watching videos on YouTube about the life of an Italian Saint called Padre Pio. While listening to his life and the miracles he performed I stumble on a video that said how he would not give absolution during confession for certain kind of repeating sins, and one of them was masturbation. I don't know why, but that really strike me and made me feel uneasy about my situation. Few days passed and after few more videos describing Padre Pio's miracles something clicked in my head and I remember I was hit by the realization that the miracles he performed and which were described and documented by so many people around the world were actually real and that God was really present in his life.

In that moment, I remember I rushed and kneeled on the floor because God was right there watching me. I stayed kneeling down while watching a video which was about 24 minutes which by ""coincidence"" was the exact number of years I had been masturbating (started as a child at 6, now 32).

I told God that I would be offering every minute of that video for every year I had been jerking off in my life.

After that day, for some reason I don't really understand I started saying the rosary while taking my dog on walks in the morning. Again I would just listen to some recordings from YouTube. After a few of them, maybe a week, I started feeling a real presence of Love in me. It was a really weird feeling that brought me to tears, however, I didn't feel sad but what I would describe as joy, a really overwhelming feeling of love. That same experience happened several times after, but it was not always there every day.

After some time, I realized I was not really drawn to porn anymore, I was able to stay without pornography or masturbation for 10 straight days. I remember I didn't even felt the drive to do it, and was feeling very strong in that regard. For some reason, I decided to fast and to offer that sacrifice to the Lord, I think the idea came about as Padre Pio himself used to fast so I fasted for 3 days straight, only hate breakfast. I think that was also part of the process, even if it only happen after my initial conversion.

As of today it has been almost 2 months without porn or masturbation and I really believe that saying the rosary daily was the great helper for my change.

I will strive to keep it going as far as I can, hopefully my whole life. There are difficult days and a twice I felt back to my habits. But, this won't stop me, the Lord gave a second change to have a free life and I won't give it up.

It feels good to be free from something that enslaved me for about 24 years of my life.

Good luck to you if you are going through the same process, keep praying, going to confession and to Mass. Your freedom and life are worth more than 5 mere minutes of pleasure that will never appease you, but on the contrary will ruin you and the people around you.

Updated:

Many people ask me about my sex life with my wife and if it has changed.

I'll be extremely honest with you, after I confessing everything to my wife she is having a really hard time now, and how to blame her. It's a miracle we are still together but she is seeing this huge change in me which is the only thing that gives her hope. I pray that everything will get better, mostly for her, who suffered the most because of my addiction. At the same time I am happy I told her because she needed to know that it was not her fault that I was being a real dick to her in the past 7 years of our relationship. I'll keep praying for her. We had sex once in the past 2 month.  It felt good, I could be present in the process and not finding myself fantasizing about porn, but there is still more trust that needs to be rebuilt in our relationship. I am tying to give her time and show her the love and the respect that she always deserved

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you everyone for your encouragement and prayers! It makes me feel so good that I am able to help others and I also feel stronger the more support I get. I believe there are many more people that are suffering for this same very problem. Porn can be worse than any other addiction, it is free and easy to get, not like alcohol or drugs.

Anyway, I thought it would be encouraging to others to post a testimony that involved my dad.

When he was a young Christian, he really sought after God. While working in a factory, he started a bible study with some of the other employees. And they would meet at the top of a very tall and steep staircase in a small room, once a week. 

One day, a large man (6'3"" 350lbs) who worked with him (he was black but that's not relevant to the story, just a notable characteristic) asked my dad if he would pray for him. The man had a bad back and working in the factory made it worse. Without thinking about it, my dad told him that if he comes to the bible study tomorrow morning they will all pray for him. 

So the next morning comes and several members of the bible study have arrived and are in the room at the top of the stairs. Sitting up there they start hearing large booms coming from this old creaky wooden staircase. One after another is actually causing the small room they're in to start shaking. Immediately, my dad realizes what he's done and can't believe he told a man with a bad back to climb this staircase. 

He gets to the top of the stairs and my dad starts to apologize for being so inconsiderate. The man interrupts my dad and tells the group that as soon as he started climbing the stairs, his back pain went away. When they prayed it was to thank God for His wonders. And for the rest of the time they worked together, the man attended bible study and didn't have back pain.",Christianity,"Yesterday, I posted about being suicidal.

It seems that Christians are at the center of many conspiracy theories and misinformation and polarization campaigns. QAnon, Anti-vaccine, microchips, God chose Trump to save us rhetoric, and more things. 

If you read information on social media, or hear it from friends, don‚Äôt believe it right off the bat. The Bible says, in 1st Thessalonians 5:21 ‚ÄúBut test everything carefully, hold on to what is good‚Äù 
Research it. It‚Äôs so easy for misinformation to spread like wildfire these days and nobody seems to question what they hear anymore. 

Most of you are probably right leaning, that‚Äôs great. The left is not your enemy. They are not demons and devil worshipers. They are patriots who love America just as much as you. They just have different ideas about what we should be moving forward. I‚Äôve seen anger and hopelessness spreading. These are not good things. God uses all things for his glory. He can use the current administration for his glory. We should all pray and believe and hope that this administration will do great things. GOD DOES NOT SUPPORT DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS. There is nothing to back up any of these claims. But God uses everything for his glory. It‚Äôs rhetoric that we made up. Baseless. 

Use common sense. The Q thing has been proven to be one large Live Action Role Play by the internet that has predicted nothing to come true. It‚Äôs all a lie and the Q account has been controlled by different people every step of the way. 

Anti-vax, microchips, new world order tracking all of us. People. Common. It‚Äôs ok to be skeptical of vaccines. There are times when they have adverse effects. But bill gates is not putting microchips in vaccines with the mark of the best on them.

I think it‚Äôs genuinely because we (especially Americans) have tended to dumb down Christianity to the point where it just isn‚Äôt a sensible religion to be a part of. I‚Äôve been to many churches in my life (within many denominations) and I notice a common theme in most. 

1.) There is absolutely no sense of reverence left. God is just a super powerful version of a human that‚Äôll set your ass on fire if you piss him off. Jesus is our boi tho. He helps our favorite team win football games, helps us pay our bills or get new jobs, he gives us ‚Äúblessings‚Äù by making pretty sunrises or something, etc. God kinda sorta has rules we are supposed to follow, but mostly he doesn‚Äôt care and we just have to ask forgiveness real quick.

2.) The church isn‚Äôt the body of Christ. There isn‚Äôt any unity and submission before God. Christians these days tend to be super individualistic and look for a fun church that ‚Äúfits them‚Äù. We‚Äôve all got our own relationship with God that is unique to us. We get in disputes over which preacher to hire because ‚Äúthis one is boring‚Äù or whatever. We argue over how to decorate the church, what music to play, etc. Church really just becomes a shitty version of a club. The entertainment is boring, the look is meh, and the music is a knockoff of soft rock. 

With these things considered, I really do wonder if it even makes sense to call a 21st century non denominational church (just as an example) the same religion as a 4the century Roman church. They really don‚Äôt seem like the same type of thing or like they worship the same type of God.

TLDR: We‚Äôve presented a watered down, stupid version of Christianity to the masses and so now lots of people say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs stupid, no thanks‚Äù and then we are shocked and whine that kids these days don‚Äôt wanna go to church.

I personally think I have very good relationship with God, and me and my wife have been praying (mostly thanking) during lunches together. I think we have always been thanking for more things in comparison to things we have been requesting/asking for.

My wife become pregnant, God blessed us with a baby. 

My wife had very common (quite easygoing) pregnancy, but at the end of it things become complicated and there were multiple risks according to doctors. They had to induce labor quite fast - but covid were against time (because of tests, waiting and so on..), and time was of the essence.

Despite that, we received from God a healthy baby, even though the delivery was extremelly painful for my wife.
Between last weeks of pregnancy and delivery itself I had been praying very instense. I think they were the most intense prayers I have ever managed to say. God replied and made a miracle, I am extremely thankful for the act He did and only with my continuous hope I can thank Him for that.

Dear God, I love You. Thank You being extremely close to me during these hard times. Thank You for sending Holy Spirit to us. Now I know I can rely on you unconditionally!
I want to encourage all of you to put your complete trust into Him. It is worth it! God is worth it!

He‚Äôs the strongest, bestest, most resilient boi you could ever imagine. He survived being hit by a car, having invasive surgery, and dealing with a number of sicknesses over the years. Whenever I prayed to God for his safety, he was miraculously healed, almost overnight.

And through it all, he‚Äôs been by my side every single day. He lays down with me when I sleep. He sits next to me when I‚Äôm watching TV. He greets me when I come home from work every day. 

This past week, he stopped eating or drinking anything. He won‚Äôt get up from his bed and he‚Äôs having trouble using the litter box. We decided we‚Äôre going to put him down, since we obviously don‚Äôt want him to suffer.

I haven‚Äôt been able to stop crying for the past 2 days. Whenever I start crying, he comes over and nudges me, like he‚Äôs trying to comfort me, even though he‚Äôs weak and frail. 

I know he‚Äôs going home to the Lord, where he won‚Äôt have to suffer anymore. I know that one day, I‚Äôll be able to join him there, and we‚Äôll be together again. I know he‚Äôll be perfectly safe and happy in God‚Äôs hands ‚Äì happier than I could ever make him. 

Ever since I was a kid, I‚Äôve had other cats who have passed away. Every once in a while, they come see me in my dreams. I see them on an island with green grass, out in the middle of the ocean, where they can run and play freely. The Sun never goes down and there‚Äôs never any darkness there.

[deleted],0.0,859.0,"Myself (35), my sister (40), my brother (32) and my younger sister (30), were all raised in an Assemblies of God Pentecostal church here in Melbourne Australia.  
It was my mother who took us every Sunday. I went to Sunday school as did my siblings and I learned a lot there.  


My mother used to dabble in the occult, she was always searching for something, always had a void in her life.   

She began to study with JWs who knocked on our door and also my fathers father was a devout JW, who actually died because he refused a blood transfusion. My Aunt and uncle also are JWs. My fathers father was abusive and my father never practiced or followed any religion. He is still unsaved.   

I don‚Äôt remember how my mum got saved as I was only a baby but I do know she has a copy of the JW Bible, and a copy of the KJV. And if I recall, the Holy Spirit showed her all the discrepancies and she wrote them all down in the JW Bible. She presented this, along with evidence from old watchtower magazines, to my fathers father and my aunt. She tried to show them that their religion was not correct and they consequently disowned our family for that.   

So my Mum found the Lord and we attended this AOG church. We were all dedicated to Christ by the pastor there. It was a nice church and felt like a family.     

My mum has always been big into end time prophecy, wary of occultic symbolism and some other stuff, she was kind of radical which I didn‚Äôt understand at the time. 
She wouldn‚Äôt let us watch Disney movies or the simpsons or play with toys like my little pony etc. My siblings and I weren‚Äôt allowed to do/ play with/ watch the things that the other children our age were doing.

We mainly were allowed to watch Christian cartoons and listen to Christian music. I remember when my sister bought her first CD, when CDs became a thing, it was a Michael Jackson CD and if I recall, my mum made her burn it.    

I can understand all this now because I understand how occultic the world is and how Satan tries to push all this on children, but as a child, I didn‚Äôt understand and I felt left out, like I never fit in anywhere. I always struggled to make friends.     

I can‚Äôt remember when exactly it was but I guess I was about 12 years old, when this odd movement entered into our church.   
It was called the Toronto blessing and apparently there was a ‚Äònew gift‚Äô of the Holy Spirit called ‚Äòholy laughter‚Äô.    

Some people from the church went overseas to get hands laid on them to receive this gift and bought it into the church along with teachings of Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Hagin, Benny Hinn etc who I believe are false prophets and heretics (I‚Äôm not sure if you agree with them but look into it, they are teaching a false gospel).


My mum tried to warn the church pastor and elders and presented them with proof, but they didn‚Äôt listen. So my mum took my siblings and I out of the church and we never found another as my mum was (I think) petrified of false teaching and found fault with every church she went to after that. But she kept her faith, even though it went cold over time she didn‚Äôt stop believing, as the years passed, she did allow my younger brother and sister to do/watch/play with things that my older sister and I would never have been allowed to though.   

When I was 13 or 14, I went to a party with some bad crowd from my school. I lied to my parents about staying at a friends home as my parents were very strict and didn‚Äôt allow parties or boys.
There were older people there, brothers of the girls from school and their friends.    
I wanted to fit in so I got drunk and smoked weed and consequently was passing out unconscious and was raped by 2 men in their 20s. I had been a virgin.    

I didn‚Äôt tell my parents because I was afraid and my life just spiralled out of control after that.    

I dropped out of school, began smoking weed daily. My first visit to a psych ward was when I was 14, for drug induced psychosis where I was put on psych meds and by the age of 18 I was using party drugs like speed, ecstasy and GHB.  

By the age of 19 I was smoking meth and injected heroin for the first time. I became a heroin addict. I had 2 abortions within 3 months because I was so reckless.   
I went to the ER by ambulance over 10 times for drug overdose but I wasn‚Äôt trying to kill my self, I just had something else controlling me (demons) and I would consume as much drugs as my body could handle until I passed out. I knew no limits. I was severely depressed.   
I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, poly substance abuse, psychosis and OCD.  

My mum frantically tried everything to help me, taking me to all these specialists and had all these people praying for me. But if she tried to tell me about Jesus, I would get into a fit of rage. I didn‚Äôt want to hear about it.

I engaged in homosexuality with other women and also prostituted myself for money and drugs.
I was a lost wretch.   

When I was about 21, I was sitting in a car with a guy I was seeing. He was smoking meth and was an ex heroin addict. But I was smoking meth and injecting it as well as heroin. My syringe was blunt and I couldn‚Äôt find a vein. I hadn‚Äôt slept for days. I had makeup all over my face, my clothes were filthy, my hair a mess and I had blood running down my arms from all the failed attempts at injecting. I was borderline psychotic from meth and lack of sleep and I just couldn‚Äôt stop trying to jab myself with this blunt needle.
I remember the guy looked at me and told me I was being disgusting.    

And all of a sudden I felt a presence right in front of me in the passenger seat, I can only describe it as the Holiness of God.
I saw myself, I saw what I was doing, and I became so ashamed. I began to sob. I told the guy something like ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt me! I‚Äôm supposed to be a Christian!‚Äù   
And he thought I had lost the plot.  

I felt so ashamed and hopeless that I decided to commit suicide. I took my things and ran out of the car and down the stairs of the multilevel car park we were in. I planned to go down to the street below (a notorious heroin hotspot) and score and get some fresh syringes and shoot up the entire amount to end my life.   

There were these volunteers who used to patrol that street with backpacks full of safe injecting kits which they distributed for free to addicts to help curb the AIDS issue. They were called the foot patrol.   

I used to get really crazy from meth and call up these counselling helplines and as I was running down the stairs of this carpark sobbing, I thought, I wish there was a God helpline where I could call a Christian to pray for me.    
Then I said a prayer, I said ‚ÄúGod, if you are real, if you exist, you need to show me right now, otherwise I‚Äôm going to kill my self‚Äù.    

When I got out into the street I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck as I saw one of my dealers talking to a clean cut guy with a backpack who I assumed was the foot patrol.   
I ran up to them frantic and interrupted them saying I needed to score and needed syringes ASAP.    
My dealer looked annoyed and told me to wait. So I turned to the guy with the backpack and I asked him ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the foot patrol yeah?‚Äù And he looked at me so confused. And then he smiled at me and answered me and said ‚Äúfoot patrol???? I‚Äôm the SIN patrol‚Äù.    
And then my dealer said to me ‚Äújust wait, this guy is telling me about Jesus‚Äù.    

I BROKE DOWN and began to sob wildly and I cried ‚ÄúI want to know about Jesus! I was just praying to God!‚Äù    
So this guy sent his sisters to me to witness to me. It was a Christian guy and his sisters who would go out into this drug filled street with gospel tracts and try to reach the lost.    
The sisters looked like nothing I‚Äôd ever seen before. They almost glowed, their faces were peaceful, they radiated love. And they witnessed to me and they invited me to come and stay at their home and that they would look after me. They were so kind, so pure. But I wasn‚Äôt able to respond. I was so thick into my sin that I couldn‚Äôt surrender, I couldn‚Äôt let go and give my life to Jesus. They asked if I wanted to, they told me He could save me on the spot but I was afraid. So I refused.    

These girls wept over me as I departed from them. They begged me not to use drugs and told me if I died, I could end up in Hell. They gave me their phone number on a pink post-it note and I promised to call them on Tuesday. (It was a Saturday).    

So I went and scored, I got a hotel room with some addicts who I barely knew and I overdosed on heroin and GHB.    
Nobody called an ambulance. When I woke up I was alone in that hotel room and they had stolen everything from me. My drugs, my money, my bag full of clothes, my phone, birthday gifts I‚Äôd bought for my younger sister, everything was gone. Almost.  
In the corner of the hotel room I saw the only thing they had left, this pink post-it note with the Christian girls number on it.   

I called my parents to help me get home and they were so angry and tired of my antics. But I remember saying to my mum, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry mum, I met some Christians‚Äù. And I gave her the post-it note.    
Then I went to sleep and slept for 2 days. My body was exhausted.   

I began methadone maintenance for heroin addiction pretty much right after that. My dad would take me to get my dose at lunchtime and I‚Äôd take it and it knocked me out so bad as I was on other meds too, I‚Äôd sleep the rest of the day. 
It was a cycle, wake up, take my dose, sleep, repeat.    

My mum (unbeknown to me) had called these Christian girls and asked for their help, because she knew that this was no life for me. I wasn‚Äôt living. I was a zombie.   
My mum organised with the girls to come and get me on a Saturday morning and take me out to breakfast, then to take me to get my dose and bring me home.    
She never told me because she knew I would refuse to go.    

Well on the Friday night before the girls were supposed to meet with me, my parents went to some event and I was left home alone. I took a bunch of pills and even tried to inject some random painkillers. I don‚Äôt know why I did that other than that I was demon possessed.     
My parents come home to find me unresponsive and my lips were blue. I wasn‚Äôt breathing.
They called an ambulance. The ambulance gave me 5 shots of narcan (to reverse opiate overdose). It didn‚Äôt work.   

I was taken to hospital and my parents were told that either I wouldn‚Äôt make it, or that I would be brain damaged. So all my family came to say goodbye.   
And then my mum remembered that the Christian girls were meant to come the next morning. So she messaged them telling them what happened and to cancel breakfast.   
They asked to come to the hospital. And they came with their brother and cousin (who I‚Äôd never met).    

They told me that in the car driving there, the cousin asked if I was blonde, he said he‚Äôd had a dream the night before of a blonde girl in a hospital bed, with evil in her belly, demons, and that she needed to vomit them out. (So weird I know).    
So while they are driving they start praying that I would throw up these demons.    

And while they were doing that, I began to throw up. I was semi conscious. I was swearing, screaming in agony, thrashing violently, my head felt as though someone was banging it with a metal bar, I was having flashbacks of my childhood and seeing snakes in every flashback. The tubes that the doctors had connected to me also turned into snakes (I was hallucinating obviously). The pain was so bad and I could smell something I‚Äôd never smelled before, I can only describe that scent as Hell.   

When I stopped vomiting, I slipped into a coma. The Christians arrived and my mum told them what had happened and they were like wow! We were praying for that!    
I wasn‚Äôt responding to pain tests (where they use a sharp object on you to test your consciousness). I was hooked up to some machine I forget what it‚Äôs called but it‚Äôs the one that has those waves to show you‚Äôre still alive.    

There was only supposed to be 2 people allowed in the room with me but a doctor let all the Christians in and they were praying over me and had their bibles and praying in tongues etc.
I don‚Äôt remember this as I was unconscious. But the story has been told to me by them and my family.    

One of the girls told me she grabbed my hand and said ‚Äúin the name of Jesus, squeeze my hand‚Äù. And I did weakly squeeze her hand. They began to sing a song ‚Äúeagles wings‚Äù I loved it from church when I was young. They told me I was moving my lips, trying to sing.   

But then something happened, whilst I was unconscious, I heard a voice, a calm, soothing voice, telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre tired, give up, you‚Äôve been fighting so long, just go to sleep forever, end the pain‚Äù. Or something like that.    

(2 Corinthians 11:14 ‚ÄúAnd no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light‚Äù).   

And I listened, and I gave up. And I felt my soul leave my body. I felt my hand slip through the hand of the Christian girl and I felt myself rise above my body to the ceiling where I looked down and saw my lifeless body. I saw the Christians, my family, and then I saw the machine which I was hooked up to, stop making waves. It was just a line. Meaning I had died.   

When that happened, everyone began to wail and one of the Christian girls yelled my name, saying ‚ÄúNO! CRY OUT TO JESUS!‚Äù     
And she said that with a raspy, weak voice, I whispered, ‚ÄúJesus, help me‚Äù.      
And after that the machine went back to normal. My soul went back into my body. And I fell into a deep sleep and stayed in that hospital for days.   

When I came out of hospital, I went and lived with the Christians for a while. They taught me the bible, prayed with me, I was set free from cigarettes and drug addiction and they laid hands on me to receive the Holy Spirit.    

I did experience God, I experienced Him speaking to me and had a hunger for His Word. I would read the Bible from morning to evening, suddenly it all made sense to me.    

My conversion was short lived because I didn‚Äôt surrender my all, and soon enough I was back in with my old group of friends, worse than before.    
I‚Äôve been a drug addict for the best part of 20 years of my life (I‚Äôm 35).     
Heroin was my drug of choice with meth as a close 2nd. I also used Xanax and other such drugs and was always heavily medicated.     

I have been to a Christian rehab, where I lasted only 3 months of which was meant to be a 12 month program.     
I have been on the methadone program 4 times, suboxone 1 time.    
1 year ago I tried to go cold turkey off 20mg of methadone. I lasted 3 days before scoring and shooting up heroin and going back on the program. I‚Äôve been on it for pretty much the entire past 3.5 years. 

A month ago, I had a boyfriend who I had been with since last June. (He is also a meth/heroin addict and also on methadone). I was smoking meth daily. I was on antidepressants and 75mg of methadone in Jan. I tapered down to 40mg of methadone.     

I cried out to God and He made a way out of that toxic relationship for me and I went cold turkey off my 40mg of methadone 10 days ago, i stopped my antidepressant 3 weeks ago (approx).

I‚Äôve experienced barely any withdrawal symptoms except for a pain in my right side, the sciatic nerve. I would like to ask for prayer for healing for that. And I hope my testimony encourages someone.     

I was into homosexuality, I was a thief, demon possessed, mentally ill, depressed, borderline suicidal, prostitution, I‚Äôve had abortions, I was a fornicator, a liar, prideful, deceitful, a filthy wretch and Jesus has removed all of my emotional hurt, all of my desire to sin. He has cleansed me and is making me whole day by day.     

He is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.   
Our time on Earth is short and I am so thankful that the Lord has mercy on me and called me back to Him.

While I had planned saving myself for marriage, I decided against that with her because I saw in her someone i could see spending my life with.  Then at the end of September she was raped.  She too started dealing with suicidal thoughts and I tried as much as I could to help her.  Her ex eventually heard about it and they ended up getting back in contact.  The day before her birthday he came to see her and since then I haven‚Äôt seen her since.  I feel so broken everyday thinking about losing her and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how much I miss her and why that had to of happened to her.

My wife is currently putting herself at risk (as a school teacher) because the school refuses to make kids wear masks (despite the fact someone tested positive in the class) for fear of upsetting their conspiracy-believing, science debunking parents. My church is being pressured to stay open despite warnings from the CDC, and I am afraid someone in my family will be hurt out of negligence for public safety.

That's not to create an excuse for myself, with the gift of hindsight and God-given advice from some of you this post does come across as angry and insulting when it doesn't need to be at all. I think too much of my actual frustration came through. Again, I appreciate all of you who pointed this out, I did not, thankfully, strangle her nor did anyone else. It was a mistake, and one that was acknowledged by her and one she was not ridiculed or punished for.

**Original Post:** Resident tech guy here, managing video stream and slides for our regular Sunday service. I have never wanted to *yell* at someone for being *stupid* so much before now.

We run a simultaneous Facebook and Zoom stream for our church. Facebook is public, Zoom is just for us. This woman shared our private Zoom password on Twitter. *After being told it was private AND after being involved in discussions regarding trolls.*

So guess who showed up halfway through our service? A raiding party of trolls bringing lots of obscenities and some very sinful images. They were not interested in our series on Exodus.

Thankfully we swiftly applied some exodus on them anyways and things are back to normal now. Please pray for me that I won‚Äôt angrily chew out our pastor‚Äôs wife for this. God loves everyone, even those who are significantly less tech-savvy and wield less brainpower than the rest of us.

He was the inspiration for the man who killed George Floyd. He is an openly arrogant and proud individual. He has no business quoting scripture unless it's in the context of repentance for the evil and wickedness that he openly promotes. And the religious leaders backing him have no business invoking the name of Christ. They are like people mentioned by Micah who give prophecies from a price and delude themselves into thinking God is on their side.

May Jesus bless you.  May God bless you.  Jesus is the only way to heaven because He fulfilled every prophecy, lived a sinless life, and then died for our sins, so that we may have a life-line to God.

The Bible says God is love and the greatest form of love is that a man give his life for his friends.  That‚Äôs what Jesus did for us after living a sinless life, doing many miracles, fulfilled every prophecy (prophecy still being fulfilled, just started snowing in Jerusalem, another major prophecy fulfilled, pandemics, signs in heavens, biggest solar flare in 3 years, search 2 preachers YouTube channel to see more about the natural disasters, search Jesus prophecy videos and Jesus healing people videos on YouTube, you‚Äôll see the miraculous, people being healed of blindness, deafness, paralysis after many years, etc.), and Jesus died for our sins.  God the father sent His son to die in a human body for us.  Jesus is God and He is the only way to heaven.  You can read more about the Holy Spirit, God the father, and Jesus in the Bible.

Maolchalann,0.0,750.0,"Critics of Christianity and Scripture often cite Deuteronomy 22:28-29 as evidence that Scripture or Christians advocate for rapists to be married to their victim (below is the NKJV translation):

&amp;nbsp;

'If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out, 29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the young woman‚Äôs father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her; he shall not be permitted to divorce her all his days.'

&amp;nbsp;

I am sure at some point you've seen this. This passage however is not speaking of rape, but rather of extramarital fornication. In the era that Deuteronomy was first written, any sex outside of marriage was seen as a violation, both of a woman's sanctity and her father's honor. As such, the punishment here is upon the man with whom the woman fornicated - as far as the Israelites were concerned, he had seduced her and tricked her into fornication, and now to restore her honor he would have to marry her and care for her for the rest of his life. This is also because the reality was that most men did not want to marry a woman who had already been slept with by another man, and as such it would have been hard for her to find a husband (and thus a provider), and it would have meant her father having to be a provider for the rest of his and her lives.

&amp;nbsp;

In the preceding verses, Deuteronomy 22:25-27, death is prescribed to rapists, and it specifies that no harm should be done to the woman, for she has committed no sin:

&amp;nbsp;

'But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the countryside, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die. 26 But you shall do nothing to the young woman; there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death, for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter. 27 For he found her in the countryside, and the betrothed young woman cried out, but there was no one to save her.'

53mV,0.0,748.0,"I have heard from some Christians participating in the recent quarantine protests that they are not afraid to risk getting the disease because God will protect them, while I respect their faith, I think they are making a mistake.

Proverbs 22:3 says ""The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty."" As you can see, avoiding potentially dangerous situations(such as a large protest) is not cowardly, it is in fact wise.

‚ÄúIf You are the Son of God,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthrow Yourself down from here. [**10**](https://www.biblehub.com/luke/4-10.htm)For it is written: ‚ÄòHe will command His angels concerning You to guard You carefully; [**11**](https://www.biblehub.com/luke/4-11.htm)and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.‚Äô[*d*](https://www.biblehub.com/bsb/luke/4.htm#fn) ‚Äù [**12**](https://www.biblehub.com/luke/4-12.htm)But Jesus answered, ‚ÄúIt also says, ‚ÄòDo not put the Lord your God to the test.‚Äô‚Äù Again here, just because God may protect you doesn't mean you should go out of your way to test it. You don't want to jump off the boat because you have a life jacket.

Finally, think bigger than whether or not you will get the virus, 1 Corinthians 8:9 says ""But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak."" While the paragraph this passage is from comes from a debate on food, I believe the ideal still applies. If God protects you from the virus but it passes from you to someone you know who is truly vulnerable, then your liberty(freedom) from the fear of disease is a stumbling block to someone else's health. Even if the virus doesn't enter your body, so much as it sticking to your hands can hurt someone you care about.

in conclusion, while the Bible says that risking your lives for others is a virtue, it is only a virtue if it is for others. Breaking quarantine to protest doesn't help others, it hurts the vulnerable around you and contributes to the overwhelming of the healthcare system, and is at the least very foolish. In conclusion, just because you *can* expose yourself to the disease and be personally protected, doesn't mean you *should*.

Though you have not seen Him, you love Him. Though you do not now see Him, you believe in Him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls*.‚Äù 1 Peter 1:6-9)

‚ÄúThese early Christians knew that they were called to share with Christ, to participate with Him. Just as He had shared in their humanity (Heb. 2:14), so they were to share in His sufferings. If the Lord of the universe suffered before being exalted, then those who are united to Him by faith will have to suffer as well.

So, there is suffering for the Christian. But after the suffering comes the glory. Christ has become more than a model for His people, and more than even a substitute for us, though He is both of those. He has united us to Himself, filling us with His own Spirit, conforming us increasingly to His own image, bringing us finally to His own home.

We have every reason to persevere and stand firm in our faith. For we have been born again to a living hope of salvation longed for by the prophets and guaranteed by Christ‚Äôs resurrection. This living hope has made us into God‚Äôs people and has empowered us to stand firm by living accordingly. As we live lives of holy love, submitting ourselves to all God-ordained authorities, we stand firm, making the decisive break with sin that tries to lead us away from the Lord. As we humble ourselves to serve one another and submit to God, the Lord will one day exalt us just as He has already exalted Jesus.

Suffering, then glory. This is Peter‚Äôs theme about Christ, and about the lives of all of us who would follow Him. One day, as Peter says here, the glory will be revealed. It is in that light ‚Äî the light that this glorious hope casts back into our present darkness ‚Äî that we live if we‚Äôre Christians.‚Äù",Christianity,"‚ÄúJesus did not suffer so as to exclude your suffering.

ztp1234,0.0,707.0,"Been seeing a lot of this crap from Covid-19 and riot-related stuff.

For all of history since revelation has been written, people get called Anti-Christ, this illness or disaster is a sign of the end times, or this is proof that god will be returning soon.

Christian or not, the whole ""end-times"" stuff has to stop. Jesus was pretty clear when he said even HE  didn't know when the time was... Getting sick of the whole ""OMG THE RAPTURE IS COMING ANY MINUTE NOW"" If you go on youtube, you can find a video featuring years 2005-2020 (2005 being when youtube started)where someone said the rapture was happening that year.

People think they are using that to help, but honestly it's a example of crying wolf, you've been wrong every time when it does happen... people will think it's sheer coincidence and worship the beast... The crying wolf needs to stop NOW. If these so-called ""Saints"" spent the time they spent on end times mess, doing what Jesus did consistently... More people would be brought to heaven. Nobody wants to hear the world is ending, they need to hear Jesus died for them.

Revelation is clear that those with their name in the book of life will not take the mark ""Whether they're raptured or they are murdered."" The concern needs to be saving souls, not explaining to someone who hasn't gone to church since 3rd grade the events of revelation are coming to pass any minute (When Jesus clearly stated that nobody knows when). 

The black plague, The fall of Rome, Many worse natural disasters then what have been happening recently have come to pass since Jesus rose again, none of these are examples of God's soon return (Even if this was valid, soon in God's time might be 400 years). 

I beg of everyone not to share the ""Bill Gates is going to administer the mark"" or ""Covid-19 vaccine is going to be satanic (when people have taken multiple vaccines)"" Why not post pictures of you and your family doing things together that make people thing ""what is different there?""

Mini rant over lol.

Edit: A few things I wanted to add after reading messages and the overwhelming response.

1. The rapture or tribulation could happen in 5 seconds 5 minutes, hous, 500 years 5,000 years. I dont know 

2. My #1 point of this post, Jesus asked us to ""share the good news"" not ""make people aware of the 7 year tribulation.""  The Bible actually says only those whose name is in the book of life will not take the mark. 

3. I'm telling you how people feel from a non-Christian point of view. Scaring people to believing, even if you are successful, never results in true love for Christ.

4. I have spent days of time studying the tribulstion, i am educated on it, I just feel its not a major concern, 5 minutes... is all it takes to lead one person to christ... there are hour long videos that spent 58 minutes of scaring and damning sin then the last 2 minutes say get saved or go to hell.

zeroseveneleven3,0.0,706.0,"This is kind of a heavy story but it‚Äôs how I came to faith! 


I was severely depressed last year. I had been suicidal for months. I was a zombie, I would sleep 16+ hours a day, shower once a week, and alternated between crying and staring at a wall. I have no idea how I finished undergrad. I have depression and anxiety and PTSD from childhood abuse and rape. I started to truly believe that things were never going to get better, that all the world has shown me was cruelty and pain. 


Switching gears, my brother converted to Christianity a few years ago. We grew up in a staunchly Jewish household- any dissent from such religion would never be tolerated. So my brother has kept this a secret from my parents, but he had informed me. He would mention Christianity in passing but I just looked at it as his coping mechanism that worked for him when he got out of rehab (he‚Äôs been clean for 4+ years, thank you Jesus!!). He‚Äôs the best brother a girl could ask for :) 


The night of this story, I was walking home from a bar where I had been with friends. I remember standing there watching everyone else be happy and just had this moment of ‚Äúholy shit I literally don‚Äôt know how to do that‚Äù and I just walked out. Halfway home, I just started sobbing. I have never been so hysterical in my life, I was on the sidewalk just crying my heart out. The pain was just too too much, and I decided this was it. I was going to go home and hang myself. I went home and wrote a note. I locked my door and slid the note under my door telling my roommates not to open the door and to call the police because I didn‚Äôt want them to find my body. I stood holding the belt I was going to use and had my phone in the other hand. It was 2am. My brother goes to bed by 9 because he has to get up at 4:30 for work. I decided to call him, and I said to myself this would be my last-ditch effort. If he didn‚Äôt answer that was it. 


My brother told me he was sound asleep when he suddenly sat straight up in bed. His phone was turned off across the room (he keeps it off at night so people from his work don‚Äôt call him- he works at a rehab) but he was overcome with this desire to go get it and turn it on. The second he turned it on was when he got a phone call from me. 


I never believed in God before. I thought religion was a nice concept and all but I never paid attention to all the ways God was working with me in my life. I know somehow something told my brother that he needed to go to me, and I know now that God has a greater purpose for me to serve. I‚Äôm sitting here crying at 4am typing this but I really wanted to share. I feel this pure connection and peace when reading the Bible, talking about Christianity, or listening to sermon. I‚Äôm only a few months in here (took my first communion in December on Christmas) and I know next to nothing (my brother called me today to tell me happy Palm Sunday and I was like uh do I give you a high five what does that mean). But I have a few sweet friends who are Christians and they‚Äôve been great little tour guides for me :) hope this story brings someone else closer to God. I am so thankful. Thank you.

Edit:

It's virtually impossible to get to everyone's questions here and in a largish number of DMs so I'm going to put a few points here so that the answers I am able to give will at least be new rather than the same stuff over and over.

1. This is not a weird kind of self-hate and I'm a mentally stable person. I have reached a point in my spiritual life where I want to leave the shallows and head into the depths and that means abandoning identities which no longer really communicate who I am or what I stand for. I no longer wish to engage with the world ""as a gay man"" but as a man who seeks union with God. These two are mutually exclusive both because the path of Orthodoxy only licenses sex within a heterosexual marriage and because ""gay"" is usually a primary identity. I am moving far beyond defining my identity by my sexuality.
2. Although my libido has naturally decreased anyway, I'm still attracted to men and that's a fact of life. I think attempting to change that is a waste-of-time, unlikely to happen and the methods of so-called ""conversion therapy"" are damaging and an insult to human dignity.
3. This decision has not been born out of a sense of God's judgement but a real sense of God's love. It is a love so profound that giving up sex genuinely does not feel like a big deal.
4. Even by the standards of contemporary gay Western men, I have had an active sex life and those experiences are nothing compared with the mystical experiences that I have had and which have led me to Orthodoxy. We live in a time in which sex is put on a pedestal and actually it's a pretty mediocre pleasure compared with other experiences which are possible but which most people don't even know exist.
5. I don't stand in condemnation over other gay men. Like any person who believes they've found something worthwhile, I'd like to share my experiences with my brothers but wherever they are in their journey, I'm here for them.

DeeDeeeMegaDooDoo,0.0,695.0,"So a month ago, exactly on April 4th, I (16F) started reading the Bible for the first time, and it was the first time I felt my brain active and opened widely to understanding these beautiful words of God! I started with 1 Samuel as it was the one my friend, once again, Alex, had told me about that was her favourite!
Even though it was tough to understand, I still found myself able to imagine David's journey!

So what really happened to make me convert, you may ask? Well let me tell you one heckin crazy story!

I live in a Muslim household, a strict one, I may say. Both my parents implemented the thought that Christianity was stupid and some messed up religion. Which I, as a young child, thought was true. 

Even when I knew this, every time I was taking the bus back home from school, I'd stare at churches, and try to peek inside them, curiosity crazily encouraging me to go inside, but fear of my parent's anger stopped me.

One of my favourite verses that I found written on the entrance of churches was this one:

Jesus said, ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.‚Äù 
I was so curious, what did that verse mean? Was it a quote from the Bible? Or simply a wise saying? 

Then the more I grew, the more I learned about how perfect children, who were raised in a church, are. How they share love and kindness, how they treat people in a good manner, how they keep their places clean. You bet as a young child I really wished I could attend church so they could teach me how to be like them! (Manners wise, thanks to my parents, I was very hateful towards the belief.)

And so, because my parents were religious, they sent me to a very Islamic school, which to this day, I despise  alot. I learned all about Islam in there, and was extra holy, except, when I started understanding things better I stopped praying like how Muslims do. I was so upset with myself for not being a good Muslim, since prayer was almost as important as believing in God, that is for Muslims.

The more I remember, the more I realize how brainwashed everyone was. How they all told part of the truth, to keep the religion going. However, as a student, I sadly didn't have many friends, and I am not that close to my family, and I used to come home and cry very often, begging God to let me have some friends, just one friend so I wouldn't be lonely!!

But of course, what would praying to an imaginary man do to me? There is one true God, so who I used to pray to, had no power to help me whatsoever.

After leaving that crappy school to a less terrible one, I finally found my prayers answered! I befriended the whole school!!! Yeaay!!
Only to change schools the very next year. And I got cut off all my friends, why? Because they were too poor to actually afford technology to message me.

However, from that year, I had one dear friend stay close to me, an internet friend, and the greatest friend I've ever made. That's right, Alex.

Alex and I were so close, it was almost as though we were two sisters separated by a world. But that never stopped us from being close.

Accidents happened and for a short while, me and Alex weren't as close, but it felt so wrong, life felt so empty without them, and for that reason, I decided it's time to fix up what has been broken. I was going to fix my friendship with them. No matter the cost.

Month after month, Alex started growing a better relationship with me through a common hobby, art. We both enjoyed drawing so much, and with her help, I developed the talent I adored and was able to draw as much as I dared!

A year later, we decided to step up our game, and strengthen our friendship more through something common as well, and that's when we both started writing several stories together.

I was very happy talking to Alex about things we both loved, making up stories was our passion, and it only kept improving by the minute!!

then in August-September, I came across something that broke my heart to a million pieces. It destroyed a huge portion of the happiness Ive built up for years. I discovered that for Muslims, Art was a sin. Drawing a whole human that, if given the soul, could live, was a form of competing with God, and that I'd be punished for eternity for doing so.
It seemed so wrong, like what on earth??? Why would an all merciful God be mad with me for something I never intended to do??? I always drew as a way of admiring God's creation, to release the creativity I had in my chest, and I was told that God doesn't punish someone for their actions, but their intentions! Something certainly did *not* add up here.

Day after day, I had intrusive thoughts that kept telling me something was wrong, and the Muslim God couldn't make up his mind on what he wants to do. I was so confused.

So to cut it short, a month ago, Alex told me a sentence that made my mind go extremely uneasy.
""Maybe, Deedeee, maybe God had made this friendship, so that you could find the right path."" Said Alex.
I remember that night, I woke up at exactly 2AM to the craziest thought ever.
The thought was basically like this:
I travel to Alex's country for college, and they invite me over for Thanksgiving, as it is a national holiday in that country, and during that, I tell them I have an amazing surprise for the entire family. They all look at me curiously and then I take off my veil and my jacket, and underneath them is a shirt that says ""Proud Christian""
I remember I found my limbs cold and my heart racing at the thought, and I couldn't help but hide under the blankets, what was that crazy thought?!!? What was happening???

As the night went on, I found myself reaching for my phone, and opening up reddit. For no reason at all I started looking up stories of converts to try and see why Muslims convert to Christianity, and it was then that every. Word. I. Have. Ever. Heard. About. Islam. Was revealed to be wrong.

3 days ago, after finding enough proof, I had decided. It was time I leave this dumb religion and find myself another. Only Christianity is the one that ever came to my mind. And so I decided. If Jesus was real, he would answer my prayers.
I kept thinking about a rational prayer to ask for, until it came to me! If I experience a headache, surely Jesus can stop the pain, right? It's just a simple headache!
And so I hide under a blanket again, and say three times. ""Jesus, please take away the pain in my head, it hurts so much and I can not stand it. Please."" 
And after the third time, I raise my head a little and look around the room. One thought in my mind. ""That actually worked.""
It was basically the breaking point for me, and so, I decided, I was going to please the God that had saved me from the horrible religion Islam is, and read the entire Bible. I will please Him. 

I started asking Alex around some questions, Hey Alex! How do you pray? Hey Alex! Where do you read the Bible online! Hey Alex! Hey Alex! And so on

Sadly after a while, Alex who didn't know I converted, became very upset, and it was their right, because they thought I didn't believe in the Bible. They thought we wouldn't end up in the same place after we pass away, and that thought made them sick to the stomach.

However, on April 25th, I found myself opening reddit again, and creating a new anonymous account to have all my questions asked, and so I asked Reddit.
SHOULD I TELL ALEX THAT IM CHRISTIAN, OH DEAR REDDIT?
Of course, the answer was yes and I kept dying to see Alex that day until finally, they FINALLY woke up.

So immediately I was like ALEX ALEX ALEX COME TO THE VIDEO CHAT I NEED TO SEE YOUR REACTION TO THIS THING IM ABOUT TO TELL YOU!!!!
Alex was like wha-
And I yelled at them until finally they entered the video chat, and I was laughing so much at them, because as best friends, they kept making fun of me because I kept jumping around in excitement, so here I quote to you what I said, what I saw, and what they replied to me.
""I believe Jesus is the son of God.""
A long pause is seen on Alex's face, and I believe they thought I was pranking them, so they replied.
""What."" 
I see their face come closer to the screen.
""You read it.""
They put their hand on their mouth for a minute.
""You do?""
""Yes. I have been reading the Bible, and asking you all those questions because I had no idea how to be a Christian.""
The next thing I saw, was Alex's face turning red and them rubbing their eyes, because they were so full of tears.
What the heck, no, Alex never cries, I KNOW ALEX, THEY DONT CRY!! DID I BREAK THE SYSTEM???
For the next half an hour, Alex was unable to stop crying, and they had a right, because I was shooting them with the most wholesome talk ever.

Ever since then, Alex and I found ourselves so close to each other. It was like Jesus embraced us both, and made us as close as we are now.

I have been praying to Jesus for a while now, and only his power was able to answer those prayers, and make me feel as amazing as I do now.

I might add to this more in the future, but for now I have a simple request for anyone who read all of this:
Ppease pray for me to be protected from Satan's lies, and from my family. Remember me in your prayers because I need to get out of here one way or the other, so pray that Jesus makes it easy on both me and my family to accept the fact that I just do not believe what they believe in.

God bless you all, thank you for reading this far! I love all of you in Jesus :)

TL;DR: Even as a small kid, I believe Jesus had planted a seed of curiosity in my heart towards Christianity, and with his beautiful plan for me, he guided me all the way to his one true religion through fixing up my personality first, then showing me the faith. And he used one beautiful human being for that, Alex.

I grew up in a muslim household, I had previously seen a man telling me he was the prophet mohammed in my dreams but this was when I was very very young - like 5. But I had left Islam in the end as I never understood it, I didn't like how mohammed would kill everyone and etc. I'm not going to go into reasons why I left, but I left, this was 6 years ago.


Fast forward to 2020, I was curious about christianity and so before bed I finished the entire book of revelations - I found this great website which puts the book into really simple basic english. I read the book and felt quite strongly about it, idk felt something in my heart. Anyways I fall asleep.

Now a little background info :- I am currently trying to drop my porn and masturbation addiction.

So in the dream, I am in my bathroom and about to jerk off. Then I hear this voice and see a bright light coming from my window telling me not to. I immediately knew it was Jesus, it reminded me of the part in the Book of revelation where John is in jail and sees the angel appear. 

But yeah I didn't jerk it in my dream and I woke up. After that I was too scared to even jerk it for like a 10 days - longest I've gone (yes that's awful, I'm trying to stop).

2nd Edit: for all you habitual porn users: porn is so addictive that it can cause ED and other performance issues when it comes to intimacy with a partner. Just some food for thought. 

Edit: *WOW thank you all for the overwhelming support and encouragement. I never expected such a positive response to this post. I am praying for everyone struggling and serious about getting right with God! Porn is a drug, and a serious addiction. It is possible to quit for good!*


ORIGINAL POST
I just want to encourage anyone out there struggling with porn addiction. My husband and I both used porn habitually, a long time before we met, and then still after we married. We both started feeling sick about using other people in that manner. I could see when the actors/cam people were bored, sad, unhappy, not into it, disgusted etc. It was taking a toll on us each as individuals, and we talked about it. I was super convicted, especially after learning lots more about the porn industry AND having read through the bible several times. 


Understanding marriage through the bible opened my eyes and gave me a new reverence for God and his plan for marriage. It made me fall completely in love with my husband, all over again. My attitude improved. My eyes stopped wandering so much. I no longer desired porn. 


Since we both decided to purposely avoid giving in to that sin addiction (idol before the Lord, honestly), our marriage has gotten better than ever in many ways. God blesses obedience. Marriage is the earthly metaphor for Christ's love for the church. We are not to worship other gods. We are not to gratify our appetites with images of those we are not married to. 


I'm not telling anyone what to do. Just want to encourage those who struggle with this sin and would like to quit some day. Repentance and change take a lot of work and faith. Immerse your heart and mind with the word of God. It will change your life for the better. Thanks for reading, if you got this far. God Bless.",Christianity,Porn Free Marriage,667.0,0.95

MFButtercup,0.0,656.0,"Hey guys, basically this post is just what it says in the title, all three of these preconceptions were primarily challenged by one particular Christian friend of mine, so here they are:

**One, that the trinity and tawheed are not equivalent in apologetics.** For a lot of Muslims, the idea that God is one, and that this is intuitive, is a huge strength for Islam. As such, we expect the reverse to be true for Christians, so when Christians aren't able to offer a defence of the trinity that strikes us as equally intuitive to tawheed, we are confused why Christians would believe this thing.

It wasn't until my Christian friend very candidly said, ""Of course the idea that God is one essence and one person is more intuitive than him being one essence and three persons. Christians don't argue for the truth of Christianity based on how obviously intuitive the trinity is; it's just not something that overrides all other arguments in the way it does for Muslims."" That I realised judging the trinity as if I should expect it to be equivalent to tawheed was silly.

**Two, that preservation of scripture from corruption doesn't have to mean keeping every word exactly the same.** This is a very big one, but as a Muslim I expected the changes to the text to be this huge source of embarrassment for Christians. It was very surprising to me when my Christian friend very casually said at one point when we were talking about the Bible, ""Of course, we probably don't have any of the original words of Moses in the Torah."" And I was shocked and just said, ""Well then why do you believe it?"" And he stared sort of blankly at me and was just like, ""Because whether or not it's the words of Moses doesn't preclude it being the word of God.""

For most Muslims the Quran is the exact words of God written in Arabic. In fact, the fact the Quran is Arabic is really important. The idea that for many Christians the Bible is understood as being in English and the original greek/hebrew is really just considered a useful study tool is very strange for Muslims. However, when I understood that actually the Christian understanding of the Bible is about a much more transcendent involvement of God in preserving the text, it really changed my view.

**Three, that Christianity has been subject to way more academic scrutiny.** A lot of Muslims get very excited about all the scrutiny that Christianity has been subject to. As already mentioned, we expect the different versions of old manuscripts to be a really huge issue for Christians. However, it was really interesting to me when my friend basically explained that Christianity has been subject to serious academic scrutiny since the 1800s, where people were seriously questioning it historical reliability. My friend even pointed out that it used to be far more acceptable to question the historicity of Jesus himself in academic circles, whereas now such a view would be seen as totally fringe. 

As my friend put it, ""Christianity is not being subject to *mounting* historical and textual criticism. It's actually made it through the worst of it quite comfortably when you look at the history of Biblical scholarship."" He then went onto explain that Islam is currently facing mounting historical and textual criticism. As a Muslim I was taught that Islam had always been subject to these challenges from ""Islamophobes"". However, when I actually looked at the real history of academic criticism of Islam... it really has just been growing and growing, and there are criticisms being made now which weren't even on the radar a few decades ago. That is something that most Muslims don't take into account where comparing how comfortable they are with Islam compared to Christianity. 

With Christianity you pretty much have all of it laid out before you: including the many criticisms. In the case of Islam, the criticism is really just beginning and it's hard to know where it will end. It sort of shows that Muslims really aren't in a position to be bringing the full weight of academic scholarship against Christianity while ignoring the growing tide against their own faith.

And there we go... those are three things that I wish I could have understood as a Muslim sooner, because once I understood these things it was basically undeniable that I'd become a Christian.",Christianity,Three preconceptions I had as a Muslim that prevented me from becoming a Christian,656.0,0.98

When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them. When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, ‚ÄúIf this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She‚Äôs a sinner!‚Äù Then Jesus answered his thoughts. ‚ÄúSimon,‚Äù he said to the Pharisee, ‚ÄúI have something to say to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúGo ahead, Teacher,‚Äù Simon replied. Then Jesus told him this story: ‚ÄúA man loaned money to two people‚Äî500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other.  But neither of them could repay him, so he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts. Who do you suppose loved him more after that?‚Äù Simon answered, ‚ÄúI suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Jesus said.

yuhyuhyuh32,0.0,643.0,"I was recently in a discussion with a distressed Christian man online in the comments of a Youtube video critiquing Creationists. This guy explained that he rejects evolution because he feels that otherwise life would have no purpose and we are simply the product of chance and mistakes. He said that all of the bad things that have happened to him and his resolve would ultimately be futile if he believed in evolution.

I shared with him that I am a believing Catholic with a degree in biology who feels that belief in God and evolution are not mutually exclusive. The existence of one does not negate the existence of the other. I explained to him that DNA mutations drive evolution through natural selection (for those unfamiliar with evolution, this is 'survival of the fittest'). DNA mutations arise from 'mistakes' in our cells' replication processes, and over enormous amounts of time has led to the various organisms around us today, and also those now extinct. My explanation for why evolution and belief in God are not mutually exclusive is that these mistakes in DNA happen by chance without an underlying purpose. I like to think that God has had a hand in carrying out those mistakes. I know some people might find that silly, but it makes sense to me.

I wanted to share my thoughts because I truly believe all people should view science with an open mind, and people (especially the religious) should not feel that certain topics in science directly oppose faith. If anyone here has found themselves in a similar position as the guy I was talking to, please try to be receptive to these ideas and even do your own research into evolution. It is an incredibly interesting field and we are always learning new information about our and all of life's origins.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer any questions and have polite discussion. For example, I can explain some experiences that show evolution in progress in a laboratory setting.

Islam and Christianity are the most similar religions in the world. Its a shame whats happening currently. Islam doesn't teach such acts of violence. Infact churches are meant to be respected in islam. And the attacker in Avignon wasn't muslim by any means basing on some news outlets. I hope we dont fall apart and come out of this as better and more tolerant towards each other

Here's an example. A testament of Muhammad on Saint Catherine's Monastery back then when Islam had vastly expanded in power.

English translation of the¬†Ashtiname¬†by Anton F. Haddad

This is a letter which was issued by Mohammed, Ibn Abdullah, the Messenger, the Prophet, the Faithful, who is sent to all the people as a trust on the part of God to all His creatures, that they may have no plea against God hereafter. Verily God is Omnipotent, the Wise. This letter is directed to the embracers of Islam, as a covenant given to the followers of Jesus the Nazarene in the East and West, the far and near, the Arabs and foreigners, the known and the unknown.

This letter contains the oath given unto them, and he who disobeys that which is therein will be considered a disbeliever and a transgressor to that whereunto he is commanded. He will be regarded as one who has corrupted the oath of God, disbelieved His Testament, rejected His Authority, despised His Religion, and made himself deserving of His Curse, whether he is a Sultan or any other believer of Islam. Whenever Christian monks, devotees and pilgrims gather together, whether in a mountain or valley, or den, or frequented place, or plain, or church, or in houses of worship, verily we are [at the] back of them and shall protect them, and their properties and their morals, by Myself, by My Friends and by My Assistants, for they are of My Subjects and under My Protection.

I shall exempt them from that which may disturb them; of the burdens which are paid by others as an oath of allegiance. They must not give anything of their income but that which pleases them‚Äîthey must not be offended, or disturbed, or coerced or compelled. Their judges should not be changed or prevented from accomplishing their offices, nor the monks disturbed in exercising their religious order, or the people of seclusion be stopped from dwelling in their cells.
No one is allowed to plunder these Christians, or destroy or spoil any of their churches, or houses of worship, or take any of the things contained within these houses and bring it to the houses of Islam. And he who takes away anything therefrom, will be one who has corrupted the oath of God, and, in truth, disobeyed His Messenger.

Jizya¬†should not be put upon their judges, monks, and those whose occupation is the worship of God; nor is any other thing to be taken from them, whether it be a fine, a tax or any unjust right. Verily I shall keep their compact, wherever they may be, in the sea or on the land, in the East or West, in the North or South, for they are under My Protection and the testament of My Safety, against all things which they abhor.
No taxes or tithes should be received from those who devote themselves to the worship of God in the mountains, or from those who cultivate the Holy Lands. No one has the right to interfere with their affairs, or bring any action against them. Verily this is for aught else and not for them; rather, in the seasons of crops, they should be given a Kadah for each Ardab of wheat (about five bushels and a half) as provision for them, and no one has the right to say to them 'this is too much', or ask them to pay any tax.
As to those who possess properties, the wealthy and merchants, the poll-tax to be taken from them must not exceed twelve drachmas a head per year (i.e. about 200 modern day US dollars).

They shall not be imposed upon by anyone to undertake a journey, or to be forced to go to wars or to carry arms; for the Muslims have to fight for them. Do no dispute or argue with them, but deal according to the verse recorded in the Quran, to wit: ‚ÄòDo not dispute or argue with the People of the Book but in that which is best‚Äô [29:46]. Thus they will live favored and protected from everything which may offend them by the Callers to religion (Islam), wherever they may be and in any place they may dwell.

Should any Christian woman be married to a Muslim, such marriage must not take place except after her consent, and she must not be prevented from going to her church for prayer. Their churches must be honored and they must not be withheld from building churches or repairing convents.

They must not be forced to carry arms or stones; but the Muslims must protect them and defend them against others. It is positively incumbent upon every one of the follower of Islam not to contradict or disobey this oath until the Day of Resurrection and the end of the world.",Christianity,"Muslim here.

3 years ago I was convicted of having sex before marriage and I was so broken. I knew I'd be with this guy forever so I prayed and prayed and thank you God this man asked me to marry him and we got married the next summer and I repented heavily for my wicked ways. But I still had sin..
 
I've been smoking weed for over 10 years. I was convicted a few weeks ago so I only smoked at night and as little as possible.

Well last week I had enough. I was convicted and God asked me why weed is so important. I couldn't find an answer!! It set me free.

It's only been 5 days... But I remembered as a teenager I fell into alcohol and I quit cold turkey a year later when I felt convicted of my use of alcohol. I can be around alcohol now and not even care about it.

So I figured, if I can quit alcohol and not even care about it ever again, I can quit weed and never care about it again.

God, Jesus and the holy spirit is so much more important than a little bit of weed every night.

All it did for me was change my mindset. It made me pray harder, it made me think harder. But it still didn't make me sober which is what God wants.

I think my eternal life is more important than my temporary life here. I want to do everything I can to make my eternal life a good one in heaven.

I want to turn from all my sins and wicked ways.

I am so thankful for this journey. I do wish I didn't do the things I did. But thank you God for sending us Jesus because wow I couldn't do it without him.

I still have sins to work with. Such as gossip. Everytime I'm at work people will talk to me about other people!! I have been gossiping and I am convicted of that too! As soon as I do it I repent. So I guess that's the first step is noticing the problem.

Jesus told us to love people, even our enemies. You are NOT loving others by exposing them to this virus.

They tell you to not contact those who leave because they have missed God...smh

They act as if they are the only ones who can hear God, and when you hear something against the status quo you have missed it to and need to get back in Gods will. 

They encourage that they have a spiritual and academic superiority when it comes to faith, that they know best, even with on evidence.

After talking with God and putting my faith in HIm, miracles have happened. I just can't believe it. I am surprised. I never thought God loved his people, rather He liked watching his people suffer. But, now I realize that God loves us and sent Jesus to die for our sins. In hinduism, you try to do good deeds to balance the bad deeds. But, the bad deeds will always stay with me.

bxrntpineapple,0.0,565.0,"Just two days ago, I would have never thought I‚Äôd be in the place that I am in now. Growing up, I‚Äôd been fed biased views on Christianity. I was raised being told that those who aligned themselves with Christianity were wrong to blindly give their lives up for God and Jesus, that prayers aren‚Äôt real. And I believed this for so many years until last night. 

For anonymity sakes, I won‚Äôt explain the event that kind of allowed me to break that cage that I placed myself in, but I‚Äôm so glad such a mentally stressful event occurred that allowed me to grow and flourish and realize that I was put on this world, to give my life to God. 

It came to me in a time where I was able to really work on reflecting on myself and for me personally, it had to come with a lot of researching and Testimony stories, and I thought to myself, if others are able to find so much comfort and solace and have so much passion, why can‚Äôt I accept that? Why am I letting the thoughts that others instilled in me hold me back if there are so many other people telling me, showing me that it works. 

And that moment, when I was able to break free, i felt the urge to pray. So, I prayed, and I waited to feel something. But I felt nothing, so I prayed again. And again, nothing. So I had assumed it wasn‚Äôt for me. So I questioned what it was that I was trying to feel, but because I had work to do, I decided to play some music, and I played Gospel music and it was right then and there, when I felt such a strong sense of contentment and happiness out of nowhere. I have never felt this strong connection before and I was so overwhelmed. 

I don‚Äôt know what this feeling is. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to say I‚Äôm Christian, but what I know for sure is that, God has planned this realization for me so intricately and so beautifully, and I am going to devote my time to pursue this relationship forever.",Christianity,I have finally opened myself up to allowing myself to start my relationship with God,565.0,0.97

WuhLuh,0.0,535.0,"My dog was recently diagnosed with an aortic blood clot. She was prescribed blood thinners, and my family can't afford the $10,000 surgery. The vet said that her future isn't looking bright, but she would keep my dog in her prayers and tell her prayer group as well.

For some brief background; when I was a little boy, I would make the same birthday wish every single year. I wanted my stuffed animal dog to turn into a real dog. I always wanted a real dog. It finally came to be years later toward the end of my adolescence. My family adopted an amazing, cartoonishly cute puppy from animal shelter. In the beginning we knew her as the devil dog due to her biting at our toes and being an erupting volcano of energy. Overtime she grew more calm and relaxed, and became my absolute best friend. Her name is Cecelia. Today she is 9 years and 1 month old.

The vet and staff love her so much they were actually crying when they found out what was going on with her. I really love this dog, man. I grew into myself with her, she watched me change so dramatically over the years, it's absolutely devastating to my family and I. She got home from the vet today, and we're supposed to do to a follow up 1 week from now.

During my prayers, I've come to the realization that perhaps my dog's mission has been completed, in a sense. Perhaps, my little girlie was sent here to help me change, I cannot express enough how much she has offered me in support. I'm a grown man now, with goals and ambition, something I've always lacked. At the end of the day, it's God's decision as to what will happen with her. I know it's selfish, but I want her to stay around for a lot longer, I want her to be able to go on long walks again, and enjoy her favorite trail, and love the life that my family and I offer her. I don't want her to suffer either. Part of me thinks, that if God wants her to return to Him, then who am I to oppose? Though at the same time, I selfishly want to still experience life with my little buddy by my side.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post, God bless you all, thank you for keeping my beloved little friend in your prayers.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words and prayers, it is greatly appreciated. I will post an update in a week when she has her follow up exam, or if anything happens between now and then. Thank you all so much, God bless and much love.

This morning I woke up very very early and I was in the mood for cinnamon raisin bread but I had no eggs so I decided I would go to the store and get some bagels and eggs.
I got to the grocery store and there was a bird with a bruised up wing at the entrance.

I asked for some paper towels and took the bird home and fed it some bird seeds and water and some raisin bread I let it heal and read the Bible to it and then went to church.

When I got home I called the animal rescue to see if they would be able to take him in in case his wing was completely broken. 
I prayed and asked God to please don't let the bird be afraid of me and to please heal the bird. 
As I got the basket where the bird was into my car and was getting ready to go to the wildlife rescue the bird popped out of the basket and started flying around my car.

I opened all the doors to my car and it flew off.

For half a day I got to have a bird as a pet thanks be to God almighty.

The first argument I hear is the government is overstepping its bounds ordering churches to close. While the reason they give for this belief varies, I think it is a flawed outlook because it focuses on the relationship between the (little c) church, the government and specifically how this affects them and their rights. How can we call ourselves Christians when we are more worried about our rights and freedoms when Philippians 2, calls us to value the interest of others above ourselves. We can not.  Christians can not concern ourselves with a temporary ban on meetings, not on our faith, when we are contributing to the spread of Covid to those who may suffer and/or die from it. 


The 2nd argument I see is the one in where people claim that God will protect them, or that if its Gods will, they will catch the disease regardless. Whether you agree with this or not, the attitude denies the love He has for non-believers. Worse, it could be sinful pride by choosing to focus on how God's love benefits them only, and ignoring the call to ministry by loving others. 

Are we sinning by not attending services in the building? Not with all the other options available to us. But we could be by choosing actions that could lead others to harm and death.

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a grocery store, 3rd shift, and I was pretty upset at some silly co-worker stuff. I ended up going off out loud (not at anyone) about the whole thing and went to sit outside. I normally never do that, but with the panic and fear I see around me about the COVID virus, I just snapped. I was crying on a bench outside talking with God about my actions, about how I never get anything right and I don't feel anyone listens to me at my job, along with some other things I can't remember. Not even a minute later, up walks this man with a cart (who I assumed was homeless, and I was correct). 

He sat down on this table next to me and started talking to me. He had a cross around his neck, and he said he was a believer of the gospel and of God. He shared with me how he was homeless and he was outside all night. He told me that he wasn't worried too much, as some ladies he knew had given him a thick blanket and a new pillow to sleep on. He said he had clean clothes too in his cart, but he couldn't find a place to shower just yet. He then said that he spends his nights picking up trash around town, because he wants to do what he can for God. He was telling me how he found a dinner still wrapped up in a plastic bag from KFC, and in his words ""It's like it just came out of the oven! God knew what I needed"". 

As I write this, I can't help but feel humbled. I didn't sleep outside, nor do I find random meals like that, I have plenty at home, in my warm house. God wanted to reach me through this man, and we prayed together that God would comfort those suffering from the virus and that we Christians can be supportive to those in need and that we could spread the love and peace of God to the world, because now is a critical time for Christians to represent God truthfully and lovingly. He is so good, and he loves you all so much. If this was encouragement, then that's amazing! If this helped you refocus too, then He blessed us both. If this makes you think about God differently, and possibly in a new light, don't sit on that feeling, let it take you and run with it back to God.

I was able to graduate high school a year earlier than I should have. However, I didn‚Äôt feel like going to college right away. I wanted to do something in life that would make me feel more important or adventurous. So I decided to enlist in the army. Before I left, my mom gave a mini cross that had belonged to her grandfather. I already wear a stew cross necklace, but there was no way I could give this up. I kept it in my best pocket. 

One night, it was getting very bad. My helicopter had crashed and almost everybody had died on board. I had not, obviously, but I could barely move and my leg had broken in three different areas. The Afghani veterans were shooting at me. I prayed to God that he at least give me the chance to go back home. The bullets had missed me, except for one. One had hit me in the chest. 

I woke up in a hospital bed. I was confused and I was told that the mini cross along with my necklace stopped the bullet from killing me. Had one of them not been there, I would have been killed. And I did get the chance to make it home. And don‚Äôt worry, my leg is doing fine now and I am in therapy for PTSD. I‚Äôm also going to school now for psychology.

When pressed on questions of God, he would tell you that he thought that ""God"" was just an idea that we can gather around as people. He didn't believe in anything after death, and told me that Jesus was a good moral teacher, but nothing else. He occasionally offered me books by Ehrman or Borg to read. Nevertheless, he remained faithful to his local (very theologically liberal) Baptist church. Towards the end, one of his caregivers reported to our family that they had found him on the floor and had approached him with concern, only to find that he was, in fact, on his knees in prayer. I don't know what that means, if anything. But it tells me that perhaps there was more to his beliefs than he conveyed to me.

Anyways, we're going to miss him. Thank you for your support and prayers. If you are so inclined, please do pray for my family as we navigate grief in pandemic-land. Not sure how to mourn when all of the traditional avenues are unsafe and unavailable at present.

Hi everyone I just want to say thank you so much for you kind words, inspiration, and advice in my last post. I read each and every comment and they all resonated with me. 

Like some of you suggested, I downloaded the Bible app and started the ‚ÄúHow to read the Bible‚Äù plan. 

After I did that, and after reading through all the comments once again, I felt I was finally ready to pray, after 13/14 years.

The closest thing I can think of to how it felt is as if I had been on a long journey for many years, but got lost and forgot my original destination. So I was wandering without direction.

During the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd and police brutality, President Donald Trump and people within his administration ordered and orchestrated the clearing of the area through the use of federal officers before curfew. In the wake of this event, we saw a church property  cleared and Christian protesters cracked down on. This includes the pastor of that church, and at least one member of this subreddit.

News of this event spread fast, and it's still making headlines four days later. A lot of lies and deflections and uncertainties have been told around this news story, but at the heart of it all, it was all for a photo op and a campaign video for the Trump administration. People are still actively enraged by these events.

This story has seen a wave of users on this subreddit, new and old, who are attempting to deflect and muck this story, and others like it. It's not like there's been a shortage of news events in the last few years. It's reminiscent of when mass shootings occur and when the topic of gun control is brought up you'll see a wave of comments saying, ""it's too soon to discuss it."" 

There's a multitude of reasons and motivations for why people do this, from favouring the status quo, to supporting their political party, to not wanting to see what they don't like, down to active concern trolling and tone policing to distract their political opposition.

There's been several lines of arguments going around in defense of Donald Trump and the events at Lafayette Square. When a church and Christians are attacked by federal agents for a photo op, it's important to root these out and examine these arguments to understand where we collectively stand.

**Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged**

Matthew 7:1(NIV)
&gt; **Judging Others**

&gt; 7 ‚ÄúDo not judge, or you too will be judged.

Ignore for a second that this teaching continues onward: Matthew 7:2-5 (NIV)
&gt;  2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
&gt; 3 ‚ÄúWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother‚Äôs eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, ‚ÄòLet me take the speck out of your eye,‚Äô when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother‚Äôs eye.

[I may have ranted about this earlier this week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/gv0d5w/matthew_715_beware_of_false_prophets_which_come/fsmvq5s/)
If you don't want to read or re-read the above link, there are three fundamental issues with this approach to completely avoiding political criticism.

1. It ignores every single instance a Prophet or Apostle has judged. This ignores Galatians 2, 1 Corinthians 5, every single OT Prophet, 2 Corinthians and the ""super Apostles"", and a billion other references within the Bible itself where a righteous person judges.

2. Without judgement, there is no ability to ask for justice. Justice is a primary petition we pray for from God, and without judgement, one can not determine what is wrong.

3. The 4 verses after verse 1. The teaching has always been about judging hypocritically, and you can tell because that's exactly the language that was used here.

**God Appointed Trump As An Authority And We Should Not Question Him**

Romans 13:1-7 (NIV)

&gt; **Submission to Governing Authorities**

&gt; 13 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God‚Äôs servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God‚Äôs servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

&gt; 6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God‚Äôs servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

Also: 1 Peter 2:13-17 (NIV)

&gt; 13 Submit yourselves for the Lord‚Äôs sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 14 or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 15 For it is God‚Äôs will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 16 Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God‚Äôs slaves. 17 Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.

This is a benefit that a lot of world leaders don't get, but this one has been rearing its head in this administration ever since Jeff Sessions used Romans 13 to justify the methods of detainment at ICE facilities.

This argument makes three fundamental mistakes. The first mistake is that Americans don't live under a monarchy or an empire, they live in a democracy (a republic if you want to get truly pedantic). Freedom of speech and criticism of the government are expected parts of American living, which are enshrined in their constitution, and are considered important, if not essential, aspects of civic participation. They aren't doing wrong by saying things, or by protesting peacefully, because they aren't breaking the law. These arguments simply do not apply to these people, including those posting on this subreddit.

The second mistake is that leaders, chosen by God or otherwise, still do terrible things. The first King of Israel, Saul, was delegitimized for his actions and descended into extreme paranoia and did many evil acts. The next King, David, a man after God's own heart and possibly the most beloved King of Israel, famously had sex with his general's wife and then had his general put on a suicide mission  to cover up the deed. He only repented when a prophet called him out. Both chosen by God, both did terribly wrong things, both called out by Godly people.

The third mistake was that these passages have never been carte blanche for leaders doing bad things. Godwin's Law insists that I lose this argument, but I don't believe that anyone here in there right mind would disagree with the churches, priest and saints who opposed Hitler during his rise and during WW2. Certainly no Churches beyond 1000 members think that way. It begs the question as to where the threshold is, and honestly, it's been fairly low throughout the history of the Church. [Here's a 10 Minute Bible Hour on Romans 13 that explains the history of this passage and how it has been applied to governments.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Pl2jRaX4w&amp;t=2483s)

---
**Jesus Was Non-Political**

Ignoring that Jesus is God and we know the history of the Prophets, since those who make this argument will do that, Jesus was a political figure in his time and political events happened around him. Let's also ignore all of those teachings and times Jesus challenged people out of their norms that don't have modern political parallels, because ancient cultures are hard.

1. His procession into Jerusalem on a donkey was a potent subversion of the ""Return of the King"" trope.

2. His public act of flipping the tables of moneylenders at the Temple.

3. The arrest and execution of John the Baptist.

4. The constant plotting and debates with the Pharisees.

5. Render unto Ceasar that which is Ceasars. Render unto God that which is God's.

6. Christ was charged with blasphemy by the Sanhedrin, and later with sedition under Pontius Pilate in the Easter story.

7. Christ suffered a brutish poltical execution on the cross. 

If the writers of the Gospel didn't think these political issues and events were important, why did they write about them? Aren't they distracting from the good news of the ressurection? 
Shouldn't they be trying to become better Christians instead of criticizing the Pharisees? Why aren't they studying the scriptures instead of worrying about the one time Jesus flipped some tables over?

**God Doesn't Care About Politics**

He's high and mighty and appoints leaders anyways, so why should he care if leaders aren't perfect? He knows leaders can't be perfect but he chose the ones that can do their nations good, or to punish them for their sins (I've seen both used).

Yet God still condemned kings, rose prophets against kings, and had commentary on the political happenings of his subjects. Do you know the donkey verse that atheists like to cite jokingly from Ezekiel 23? That was a passage of God using Ezekiel to condemn Israel's alliances of all things. If God doesn't care, why did he bother to send the prophets?

The Old Testament is full of political discussion and condemnation of leaders and the actions of nations. These aren't new inventions of the Enlightenment or some nonsense, this is stuff that God did through the Prophets. We only get to see a fraction of it in this era, but this is one topic he most certainly wasn't silent on.

Or we could go to Prophets like Amos, who condemned the Northern Kingdom (Israel) on many grounds. He railed on the corrupt courts and the bribery in them, the removal of social programs (especially the practice of gleaning), the explicit taxation of the poor for the benefit of the rich, and a marginally religious society that cared more about wealth than actually following God's commands.

Or how about Habbakuk, a prophet who demanded justice on the Southern Kingdom (Judah) over violence, injustice, wrongdoing, destruction, a law incapable of doing anything and the evil perverting their justice system? His problem wasn't that God was going to respond to all of this (and he did), but that God was absolutely going to wreck Judah with the Babylonian Empire and wipe it out of existence on those grounds.

Or how about Jonah, a man who resisted the notion that God's grace could fall on Israel's enemies and eventually offered God's ultimatum of repentance for their evil society. And they did repent, at least for around 100 years before they recanted and beat Israel around.

The Bible's full of em', all voicing some very strongly worded statements against governments and leaders. Some of the prophets start with entire lists of condemnations for surrounding nations and over Israel. All of their words and condemnations came from God.

PsychoactiveWanderer,0.0,420.0,"Hi everyone. I felt called tonight to share a little bit of my story. I'm going to keep this one short, I will most certainly write up an account of my life that does more justice to the actual situation, but for now I want to give people hope and share this little testamony. 

I've had a pretty fucked up life. Filled with things that go far beyond the scope of this post. For most of my life I struggled with a crazy pornography and masturbation addiction. This lead me to extremely dark places (to say the least). This addiction nearly destroyed me.

I officially became a Christian about two months ago after hearing about Jesus from a friend at university. I'm 26 years old and have been crushed by this addiction for about 13-14 years. 

11 days ago I hit absolute rock bottom. I had taken drugs and watched pornography and was absolutely crushed. I felt the worst I have ever felt and just felt destroyed by my own nature. 

I was alone, in the dark, after a drug and porn binge. Absolutely depraved and guilty and confused and in pain. 

In that moment I fell to the floor and called out to God and Jesus the most powerfully and genuinely I have managed to pray before. I was almost in tears, pleading that these demons be lifted from me in the name of Jesus and through the power of the Holy Spirit. 

All of a sudden I heard the words 'He Alone is WORTHY'

Everything changed in that instant. Instead of crying about my own unworthiness I looked toward Jesus. A rush of life giving liberating energy coursed through my body. 

Ever since that day about 10 days ago my life has changed. I am no longer enslaved to my addictions. I am no longer enslaved to sin. Jesus saved me in my darkest most depraved hour. I am finally free.

I thought I was unsavable. I thought I had gone too far. When I was the most weak I had ever been Jesus chose to reveal His power. He told me that His power works best in weakness. It is true that His Grace is all we could ever need. 

I honestly can't explain what happened other than that right now. I'm a totally different person. Its miraculous and absolutely overwhelmingly incredible. Jesus Christ came into my dark, sinful depraved life and lifted me up out if my own nature. 

In an instant my dark human nature which I had lived with forever vanished off my back. My shoulders no longer felt the weight of the darkness of the enemy. 

Thank you Jesus. I will never forget this all my life. 

Every second is a gift from God our Creator when we are saved by Jesus!

My family never kept me from my faith and going to church or mocked me, but they never truly supported (or took seriously) my believes either. I think they're like ""yeah, another phase, it will pass"" and don't take my opinion seriously when it comes to anything, for obvious reasons... I am just a kid for them.

One of the worst things is, that they can't see (and probably never will) the change God has made in me. They were blind to my struggles before i started to follow The Lord, and they are blind to how my life turned all around. I bet they would never think i ever considered suicide and now have tendency to cut.

I don't blame them tho. They didn't hurt me purposely, they always tried their best to raise me to a healthy woman.

The frustrating part i would like you to pray about, is that (espessialy during quarantine and holidays) i have no private place for praying. I live in a house, but it's a small one and I share room with older sis. There is no privacy, no knocking on doors in this house. I try to convince myself that i am not ashamed for my faith and wouldn't mind them running into me while praying, but lets be honest here - i just can't fully focus with them in the house and I don't want them to see me and possibly make some comment.

My faith is frequently dying out cuz of not enough prayer, my relationship with Lord is often non existent and it grieves me. And causes thoughts about hurting myself.

Platinum247365,0.0,367.0,"A few years ago, I had troubles with dating, so I swore to myself that I would become the best Godly man I could possibly be. I decided to go to men's bible study to achieve that end.

**As it turns out, that was a huge mistake.**

We would have a lecture on overcoming certain obstacles in life, and we'd have talks at our tables. What was the biggest struggle that these men complained about? It was their marriage. It was their wives. ""My kids are disrespectful."" ""My wife always yells at me and argues with me."" ""I have trouble paying my bills."" ""My wife is too demanding."" ""My wife won't let me do anything."" ""My wife doesn't like my friends or my hobbies.""

**The lectures and lessons were of no help whatsoever.** Sometimes, the subject of the lecture was an example of a loveless, strained marriage or a divorce. These were used as a warning when God isn't in one's marriage. There was one story where a wife said to her husband: ""I think you're a pain to deal with, and I want a divorce."" And so - what kind of advice was given from the pulpit? ""Ask God to come into your marriage."" ""Step up and be a good man to your wife."" ""Stop complaining. Love your wife."" Many times, marriage was not the focus of the lesson, but the discussions, lectures, etc. would relate to bad marriage as an example.

Now look: As a young unmarried man, they do not realize the effect that this has on someone like me. The lectures and discussions were about dealing with marriage on many occasions. Therefore, I could not relate to many of these lessons at all. **Know this:** If all that Christian men do is complain about their wives all day, do you think that they're setting a good example for younger men? I don't think so.

**My last straw was when we went to a men's retreat with other churches.** At one point, there was a huge lecture. We had a well-known guest pastor preach to a huge crowd of men. And what did he talk about? You guessed it - marriage. He pretty much regurgitated the same talking points I mentioned above. ""If you're having a tough marriage, be a good man to your wife."" ""Come get some counseling at the church and we'll help her."" You get the idea.

**That's when the ideas were seeded in my mind. Why even get married in the first place?** Why even bother with these struggles in the first place? God had shown me that as a single man, I was free. I caught up with that guest speaker later in that retreat and told him that based on all the things he said, I don't think I want to get married. He could not answer my concerns and just told me not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

It just does not help when the church doesn't have much answers for struggling husbands except for shaming tactics. And the rest is history. After that retreat, I left men's bible study, and accepted my singlehood. Still, many people try to convince me to change my mind about marriage, and they have trouble respecting my choices, but at the end of the day, I'm happy. I still struggle with lust on occasion, but honestly, **I'd rather struggle with that than deal with the drama of an unhappy marriage.**

Then I started to think, I don‚Äôt recall any preacher or devout Christian being portrayed in a good manner in mainstream movies and tv shows.

Christians are usually portrayed as dumb rednecks or stubborn simple folks who refuse to believe in science and won‚Äôt follow logic.

This really bothers me because this isn‚Äôt what I see in the real world. Most preachers are good people. Only a small percentage of preachers are corrupt, pedophiles or con men.

Today in 1895 we remember the death of Frederick Douglass an American social reformer, abolitionist, and statesman, his story inspired me as I researched for a podcast and I'd like to share it with you 

Douglas had been born as Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, and had been born into slavery on in a planation on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, probably in his grandmother's cabin. He successfully escaped from slavery after meeting and falling in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman in Baltimore about five years older than him. She strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom and after escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, becoming famous for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings. His communication skills and intellect provided a powerful counter argument to the slaveholders' arguments, that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.

His autobiography, *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American* *Slave*, became a bestseller, and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, *My Bondage and My Freedom*.  After the Civil War held several public offices and became the first African-American nominated for Vice President. He was effective because he made alliances across racial and ideological divides, which was criticised by radical abolitionists, under the motto ""No Union with Slaveholders,"".

As a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard his gran reading the Bible, as  he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity*. I was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend*. Mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. He strongly criticized religious hypocrisy and accused slaveholders of wickedness, lack of morality, and failure to follow the Golden Rule, distinguishing between the ""Christianity of Christ"" and the ""Christianity of America"" and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".

In a famous speech in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a blasphemy when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. Considering that a law passed to support slavery was ""one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty"" and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church ""stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form"", and ""an abomination in the sight of God"". As his reputation grew he visited  the United Kingdom, between 1846 and 1848, where he asked British Christians never to support American churches that permitted slavery, and expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.

Sometimes considered a precursor of a non-denominational liberation theology, Douglass was a deeply spiritual man, and on his fireplace mantle he had busts of two of his favorite philosophers, David Friedrich Strauss, author of ""The Life of Jesus"", and Ludwig Feuerbach, author of ""The Essence of Christianity"" as well as prominently displaying interior and exterior photographs of Washington's Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Anglicanpolitics123,0.0,343.0,"The categories of liberal/conservative as well as Left vs Right are categories that come out of the Age of Enlightenment and specifically the French Revolution which was an anti clerical revolution. I mention this because of the fact that historic Christian social ethics does not fit neatly into these paradigms. C.S Lewis mentions this in Mere Christianity where if a Christian where to live out their Christianity in full, they are gonna find themselves take positions to the left on certain issues(especially economic issues) while being more traditional on other issues. 

This is important because you have a lot of people who see faith strictly through a partisan lense. Especially American Christians. So for people on the right, being a Christian is basically just the platform of the Republican party. While for some progressive mind people being a Christian basically just means being an echo chamber of the Democratic Party platform. When we engage civicly in society of course we are going to choose the party that we think best represents our values. But we should remember that no party or political ideology is the Kingdom of God. Our job isn't to be the echo chamber of a particular party, ideology, or cultural zeitgeist, whether it's a culturally conservative or culturally liberal one. Our job is to be an echo chamber of the Kingdom of God. 

Jesus in his day lived at a time of enormous partisan division. The Pharisees and Sadducees where the Republicans and Democrats of his time. And yet his Kingdom agenda did not fit neatly into their worldly categories and he ended up pissing of both partisan factions. He was to use the words of Pope John Paul II, a sign of contradiction. And that contradiction continues to his trial where Pilate and Herod, two people from different political factions, are said to become friends because they found a common enemy in Christ. So if you are truly living out the Christian life and Christian social ethic, you should find yourself not only not fitting neatly into these categories but in some cases wrankling those who do.

OutlawWyatt,0.0,319.0,"My mom was diagnosed with a laundry list of mental disorders and took over a dozen medications to try and function. It still didn‚Äôt seem to work. My dad had fallen victim to a life of sin to cope with his broken marriage. And then against her will and desire, she gave birth to me. 

From day one I was left in the care of a really incompetent woman, and my father wasn‚Äôt always present to pick up the slack. I paid for this, all the way until their divorce at 4yrs old, and moved into worse conditions with my mom at her mother‚Äôs house, with her other adult brother and sister - all with the same bondage of mental health. 

I have no idea how I survived my childhood and my family up until age 17 when my dad finally got custody. He had tried my whole life, he didn‚Äôt want to be absent. My mom was a really insidious kind of manipulative and kept us separated for most of my life. Nonetheless, I crawled out of that pit of despair at 17 and into the arms of the loving parent I desperately needed. He not only rescued me from my mom and her family, he pointed me to Christ. I was an absolute mess with so much brokenness, and despite it all, I ran to Jesus and I got saved.

A lifetime of demonic bondage through generational curses and displayed abuse followed me in my immaturity of not knowing The Father and His Word well enough yet, and I opened the door for it. Over, and over. And I‚Äôd move forward, or try, and I‚Äôd get sucked back again. 5 years of being beside myself with not understanding why I couldn‚Äôt just keep my focus on Jesus, as I had come to know Him and His heart for me decently well. My church even began to call on me to preach and lead in certain aspects. There was real evidence of me following Christ. 

I‚Äôve spent the last 2 weeks losing weight, losing my mind, not sleeping and withdrawing from my family, even my 2 year old baby girl. And I just gave into believing I was a lost cause, because I obviously too, had a mental illness like my family did. I accepted that I would always fight this battle of my chains of the past keeping me bound, over and over for the rest of my life. 

I was hidden away in my office this evening when I was prompted to open my bible for the first time in weeks and at random, opened Mark 9. Holy Spirit called out the exact spirit that had convinced me I was mentally disordered and beyond help. And no sooner, my pastors wife sent me an 1:30 long spontaneous worship and asked ‚Äúwhen‚Äôs the last time you had a spiritual bubble bath?‚Äù. I went to just soak in His presence, despite feeling miles away, and He overwhelmed me with Him surrounding me, and guiding me with love to honest forgiveness and repentance of holding contempt in my heart for each family member that failed me, one at a time. 

He was patient. He was loving. He was reassuring. And I feel like a brick has been pulled out of chest, and I can feel and breath again with no fear of the future, I‚Äôm assured of His love and His presence being with me always - He even showed me the moments as a child I was huddled on the bathroom floor sobbing for my life to end, and how He was present, and covering me with His love even if I didn‚Äôt know it.

MstrMatter,0.0,319.0,"As I take a look in this sub it frightens me to see people almost accepting a homosexual lifestyle and those of us who seemingly support it. While I love to see my brothers and sisters loving one another we need to keep in mind that it is a sin and we are not to accept it. You can love someone without supporting what they do. 

I struggled with Homosexuality myself and I can say from a first hand experience that I was not born that way and it didn't feel natural either. Constantly I had inner battles with myself and did not know what to do. And so I looked for answers. I read the word of God, and I then went to other Christians who I knew had also read the Bible. NOTICE: I read the Bible for myself before going to those who had. I also looked into it from a scientific perspective as many of those who had identified to be apart of the LGBT community had said they had been born this way. It turns out that there is no evidence of someone being born this way rather the opposite. Homosexuality has been influenced by environment and personal experiences. Here are the sources I have found to come to this conclusion if you are curious:

[Source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3535560/)

[Source 2](https://www.mentalhelp.net/internet/addiction/pornography-exposure-and-confusion/)

With all this being said, you are NOT supposed to hate, harass or abuse anyone who calls themselves gay, it is just a sin like all the others and we are all sinners. But it also doesn't mean that we accept the sin because it is called Love when in the Bible people are deceived many times. It doesn't help the cause. And if you want me to prove that you are born straight, I most certainly can.

Edit 1: Ok, I have been looking through the responses of this all day and I simply cannot respond to all of these. I have College work to do and Finals to start getting ready for. With that being said, the most frequent thing I see is people discussing the matter of being born gay and while I have learned a lot from some of you, a lot of you are being quite mean and cruel which is wrong in every aspect. I made this post to not only spark a discussion so that I may learn more, but to also see where my own people stand on this issue and for the most part I am relieved. 

I just want to say this, the reason I think people are born straight is due to simple biology and how we go about creating life. Rather you are a gay man or a lesbian Woman you were still born with the ability to create children. In other words, if a gay man was to sleep with a woman and release his semen inside her, that semen would look for the egg. No matter how much that man said he is attracted to something else, his human nature has already been written from the start. The same case can be said about a lesbian woman, she still gets monthly reminders (her period) that she is to bare a child, no matter how much that woman said she was attracted to other woman her human nature has already been written. This is not a coincidence. Sperm does not look for an egg just because it's sperm or evolution nor does a woman get her period every month just because she's a woman. Someone made it that way, it was intended to be this way. And that someone was God. He didn't make two people of the opposite sex in the beginning and tell them to reproduce so that we could go and have sex with the same gender. It's simple. Now if you want to say this does not play any part in attraction, I'd beg to differ as we can see through puberty our, for the lack of a better terminology, default setting is still maturing so that it can find a mate and have children with. Of course every situation has it's extreme cases, rather somebody is infertile or we have 200 species of animals who participate in this activity, but this does not mean it was meant to be this way. We live in a fallen world, sin is rampant and keeps us seperated from God, of course without your Creator around to take care of you, things would get rough as if a Farmer leaving his crops unattended.  It was us who brought this upon ourselves and it is God who is trying to help lead us back to glory. Now if you want to sit here and read in between the lines of every single verse and try and downplay or reword them so that you can benefit from it, firstly, you're wrong for doing so as you won't benefit from it. Secondly, you're missing the entire point of the Bible, it literally stands for BASIC INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE LEAVING EARTH and I don't think it would take all that much effort to understand and follow something with the help of Christ; it isn't called basic for no reason. 

I have also seen people state that I am still gay, implying that I'm lying. I don't know what I can tell you. I have no reason to lie. I have much better things to do than sit here and think of some made up story about my life. Of course I still have thoughts of it, but it has/is drastically decreasing every day. And I'm confident when I say that one day I will no longer have those desires &amp; thoughts. If you still don't believe me, that's fine, I have nothing to prove to you or anyone else, just know that this isn't an extreme circumstance I speak of. 

I have also seen a lot of people talking about my fruits, implying that I'm a false prophet and/or wishing me pain. I can tell you where I've come from, my walk of life so far. I don't know if I'm a prophet, I would be honored if I was and probably wouldn't be able to believe it. I'm just here to get some insight that's all. It's fine if you can ""win"" the debate, I'm not here to win, just need to understand better. I am ignorant as is everyone else and I seek knowledge.

We played baseball together and we loved every minute of it until we were out of high school. When I heard the news I was upset to say the least. But I was more upset because even after 6 years of knowing each other I had never asked him about his relationship to God. After I heard the only thing I could say to God was: ""I hope he is with you now"". Because I didn't know. For 10 days I was plagued by what I should have done differently, and how I could've asked. I never invited him to come to church because he said he was going somewhere else but we never talked much more than that. So I've sat awake at night wondering if I'd ever see him again. 

Today was the day of the funeral and the day God reminded me that he still works even without me. The pastor shared a number of verses and mentioned his salvation which was bittersweet. I hugged his parents and told them we'd see him again, and the hope that was in their eyes was something only God can provide and I've only seen in those who truly know they'll see them in heaven again. 

So, my brothers and sisters, God still works in this world and is still saving and healing souls even without our help (duh). And He's still giving hope to everyone who wants it. But don't wait to talk to your friends about their relationship with God. It's much better to know for sure than to wonder at night. You better believe I've asked all my friends about their beliefs since he passed and I won't make the same mistake I did with my friend. I will live the rest of my days in hope of what's to come, with sadness I have to wait to see my God and my friends and loved ones again. And I pray all of you will hug your friends and family tight and talk with them. life is short and death can come at any time for any of us.

kcdd,0.0,302.0,"I was born with liver disease and a heart condition.  By my late 20s, I had three heart surgeries and one major liver surgery that included several years of illness.  I struggled with both romance and employment in my 20s.  I ended up doing lots of volunteering which led to lay pastor work and church planting.  I did have seasons where I was able to work, but another bout of illness always arose.  I have had a (chronic persistent) disability pension since I was in my late 20s.   


In my early 30s, I met her.  She was wonderful to be around.  I left for Europe for a mission trip that was supposed to last one year.  We stayed friends. Two months in, my liver failed and I was hospitalized for 6 months.  She kept calling, I told her I was probably always going to be sick and life would be hard with me. She didn't care. She said if this works, ""for better or worse...""   


We married about a year after I came home - 2 1/2 years after we met.  I was very ill when we married. Our honeymoon was derailed and I was hospitalized. I had two major surgeries with complications during our first 3 years.  We prayed together and stayed together. Sex was hard and became harder and harder, but we tried.  I started to get better and started to go to university in my mid-30s. She got a Federal job, making great money.  We had a baby boy. He was brilliant. A very fast learner and he had a great memory, but then we realized he had autism. He is so smart and such a fast thinker he has no social awareness.  We love him regardless.   


Then I had liver failure for the 3rd time, leading to transplantation.  I have since had 2 transplants. The transplants were complicated and there were complications afterward.  We moved into a new home, but I didn't get better. Yes, the new liver helped, but I now just don't heal well and I struggle with the side effects of all the medications.  I had my last liver Tx in 2017 and the incision has burst open. I have a 23cm hernia.  I am waiting for surgery in about 6 weeks.  


We are both illegitimate children. Our parents never married and never lived together.  We are estranged from half-brothers and half-sisters we never met. Both of our parents died early.  Our family has always been our circle of friends we've built. She is a marathon runner, goes to the gym regularly, and eats healthy.  I struggle to get food into me, am depressed, and rarely leave the house.  She took on all the work, but I tried my hardest to do chores and take care of our son.  She loves the outdoors. I still do also and I am adventurous, but just don't have strength or energy anymore. As our lives progressed I watched her spark disappear. The bubbly smile and bounce she had are gone.  


Last week, I had biopsies for cancer.  I am on about 20+ pills a day and one has a significant risk for cancer.  I could feel her insides snap when we found out.  One morning I felt her pain and could see that she couldn't take it anymore.  I called everyone I knew, pastors, long-time friends, family. I knew she/we were in trouble.    


Last Friday, she told me, ""I can't do this anymore. I am divorcing you"".  


We have always done a ""check-in.""  Two to three times a week we go for a coffee and talk about where we are at, our feelings, and where our marriage is going.  When we both got married we struggled with money, but now we have very little debt and a positive net worth.    


Part of me accepts that I am just going to be sick and things won't get better; therefore, I want to let her go to find peace and maybe love again.  I see her pain and struggle.  She has given me 16 years. In many ways, she enables me to stay a victim, the sick guy, the disabled husband.  There are no real 'biblical grounds'; for her to leave me. Neither of us has committed adultery, nor has there been abuse. But there has been a breakdown, a failure.  


We both consider ourselves committed Christians, but we are also realists.  Tonight we sat together and talked for 2 hours about the problems we have faced over the years.  We talked about the pain we both feel. We talked about dashed hopes and broken dreams. We talked about being friends and co-parenting. We talked about dividing assets and money.  We talked about how divorce is an identity destroyer, the exclusion that severs the soul, especially when church people are self-righteous about covenant and don't understand the mercy of the cross.  But we also talked about embracing a new identity as friends and co-parents. We talked about her finding healing, being alone and rediscovering ourselves. I have very little hope for myself, but I can have hope for her.  


Honestly, I am not sure why I am writing this here.  I want to hold on and fight to repair and heal our marriage, but there is a part of me that is too tired to fight for it anymore.  Part of me just wants to be alone and not cause pain to others.

First of all, I want to thank you guys for being an amazing subreddit. Often, I'll be scrolling through Reddit looking at all the negativity in the world and I'll see one of your posts and I'll just be so uplifted and encouraged. Just to give some context, I grew up in the church and never really gave any thought to why Christianity was important to me until high school. I went through an extremely dark time in high school and in the beginning, all I could do was blame God for my unfortunate circumstances. However, through all the darkness, I learned to lean on God rather than make Him the target of my sin and burden. I tried to read the entire Bible multiple times through high school but failed every time.

In January of 2020, I made the decision to read the Bible all the way through, no matter what. I started off strong, as most people do when they first make a resolution. When I entered college in August, I hit a rough patch and I set my Bible aside for 2 months; during this time, my old struggles returned and I once again neglected God. When I got home for winter break, I opened my Bible, and immediately, I was so overwhelmed with guilt and emotion. I began to read again and I fell into the rhythm; during this time, my bond with God grew stronger and I felt spiritually strong. Today, January 20, 2021, I finally finished Revelations. It's a relatively small accomplishment, but as someone who struggled with his faith for a long time, it feels good to be able to see progress in my journey. 

If anyone reading this is struggling with getting through the Bible or just faith in general, the only advice I have for you is to submit everything to God. It sounds dumb but when we try to do things with our own strength, we often fail and it creates a disconnect in our relationship with Him. I tried so hard to do everything by myself, but I only saw progress when I failed. If someone as broken as me can do it, you definitely can!

ztp1234,0.0,281.0,"I grew up in a hell-fire and brimstone preaching family... Recently I had an issue where the anxiety of being a Christian was not worth even believing in it anymore, so I gave up.

After a few years away and the anxiety from the fear of hell... I decided to pick up a bible from an adult 100% unbias POV and interpret scripture and who Jesus was myself... I came to one conclusion; Jesus is who he says he is, the son of god.

He loves us and is willing to die for us, so what went wrong last time? Through studying and prayer, I finally figured out what caused that anxiety... Satan's deception.

Jesus in the bible constantly reiterates... Love others as yourself, loving others as yourself, do good unto others, even those that hate you (Etc.). What happens when anyone walks up and starts concerning themselves with other thing (like the Pharisees and the sabbath day) Jesus refutes it and puts the wellbeing of others above everything.

I read and interpreted the ten commandments differently this time around. I don't even feel commandments is the proper term, I feel like the commandments are an instruction manual from the manufacturer on how to operate ourselves.

 1. Love god over anything else

. 2. Love each other as ourselves

 3. Don't work 7 days a week (we do not serve the sabbath, ""the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath""). This in my opinion is Satan's largest deception out of god's word, he has divided a large part of the church just by causing anger over what day we worship Christ over. We need to live like Christ for SEVEN days a week, not 1. Again, the Sabbath according to Jesus ""was made for man"" to rest, not be an important holy day to send people to hell over. 

4. Honor your father and mother (if everyone lived as christ intended we would easily be able to follow this, honor doesn't have to mean worship, but don't curse them.) I understand some had rough parents, but if we follow commandment 2 and ""turn the other cheek"" this falls into place.

 5. Thou shalt not kill. 

6. Don't have affairs...

 7. Don't steal.

 8. Don't lie or have other gods before him.

9. Don't lust over someone else's spouse. 

10. Don't be jealous of what someone else has. 

Now... What does Satan do? He takes these ten commandments and makes EVERYTHING complex as he did with the Pharisees in the time of Jesus... The Jews crucified god's son, and they took the commandments just as literally as anyone. 

100% of Jesus's message on earth was about serving others and not harming others (sinful activities 9.5/10 times end up hurting others)... We make mistakes, but we follow many of the rules on a daily basis just by law... 

Many Christians criticize people who are gay, had abortions, are prostitutes, liars, thieves, murderers... Those we're Jesus's friends... Those we're the people he ate with, laughed with, prayed with, and served... 

Ultimately, that is where Satan is winning the war... God sent his son to earth and made is so SIMPLE, all we had to do is love one another and not hurt each other... and we ALL would inherit the kingdom of god! What happened? Satan overcomplicated something so simple and we now have 10+ denominations and a religion that non-believers feel are 1. hypocrites 2. Judgemental 3. and super conservative. 

I apologize if you disagree with me, I believe sincerely that Jesus's message on earth was to concern yourself with serving others, not what the new set of rules is after the old testament like Satan leads the church to believe. We all can do a better job of being like Jesus, 1. Stopping and offering to take the homeless man to lunch and share Christ 2. Serving others without time, not just worrying about how much money to serve with. 3. Ultimately just doing a better job of being better friends; praying for each other and not wasting time on debating what is right or wrong... If we have the holy spirit and our number 1 concern is serving others every day as Jesus did, all that will fall into place. I'm sure Jesus heard many raunchy jokes, saw many people with terrible diseases, and saw lots of sin, that didn't stop him from loving. Ultimately, we need to remember we get to be with God by believing in Christ, not following rules... I can base my theory on how I know I'm right, these arguments are the reason we have 5 churches on Sundays half full within 5 miles of each other instead of 2-3 full ones.

kittyrina1,0.0,278.0,"As women we are always blamed for our bodies or how we look, that it is our fault men stumble. But where do these opinions come from? What should we teach our daughters or sisters? That their bodies are shameful and should cover everything? Well let's first dive in, into what the bible says...

**The bible doesn't teach that bodies are shameful.**

Genesis makes it clear that our Creator *delights* in us. God called humans the highlight of creation. We weren't simple ""good"", but *""very good""*. 

In the Psalms, we're told that humans are *fearfully and wonderfully made* (Psalm 139). I am sure everyone who reads this verse, feels their confidence boost a little.üòÜüíì

Paul describes a mystery beyond imagination: our bodies are the **home of the Holy Spirit** and we are **a part of Christ**!. And Peter, wrote that we are built into **God's spiritual temple** and already *are* His holy, royal priests (1Peter 2:5,9). 

If God considered our bodies shameful, he wouldn't make His home in us. Our *whole* body is His temple, not just some parts, like only half our legs or half our arms..

God rejoices in the *forms* He created. That didn't change when sin and shame entered the world, in fact it was *humans* who felt shame of being naked, not how God made us to be. Weren't Adam and Eve *both* naked before they sinned? Nakedness was no problem before they sinned. Therefore their bodies are *not* what is shameful. It's **sin.**

**The bible doesn't teach that the victim is at fault.**

I don't even know why this is a thing tbh. But here we go. I can't find a single situation where the Bible implied that sexual assault is the woman's fault or what she wore that day. Bathsheba (2Samuel 11), Tamar (2Samuel 13), Dinah (Genesis 34) - all three stories are instances where *men* sinned, not as examples of women who ""had it coming"" because of how they behaved or dressed. It's sad that these words could come from Christian men today. It's her fault she had a short skirt..How short should a skirt be to tell someone not to sexually assault them? üßêüìù

Scripture doesn't even *imply* that Bathsheba shouldn't have bathed naked where David could see her. It was actually David's sin. It doesn't admonish Tamar for going into her half-brother's bedroom without a forethought. Or Dinah because she was wondering into the ""wrong part of town"" at the ""wrong time"". These women all suffered terrible harm, but there is no biblical evidence that members of their communities asked them what they were wearing or how late they were out. 

Scripture does say however, that the responsibility falls on the *perpetrator*. Not because the women were beautiful and the men couldn't help themselves. When Paul talks about sexual sin, he argues that, *""You can't say that our bodies were made for sexual immorality""(1 Corinthians 6:13).* Seems to me that Paul was contradicting those who said male bodies are *biologically programmed* to respond to sexual urges. 

**The Bible does not teach that we can blame others for our sin.**

Jesus's teaching is consistent with Paul's thoughts on sexual immorality. He warns that *""everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28).* Jesus doesn't add ""unless she's dressed revealingly"" or ""except when you feel like you can't control yourself"". I'm sure Jesus would have said that, **if** it was the *woman's fault.* 

**The bible doesn't teach a dress code.**

 In 1Timothy 2:9 and 1Peter 3:3-4, Paul and Peter are addressing the same issue, and it's not lack of body coverage. **It's excess.** They appeal to women who felt the need to show everyone else in the church how much they could **afford** to look good.
The word ""modesty"" in these verses means ""downcast eyes"". In other words, Paul is advocating *humility* and *self control.* 

It was about the being prideful in their clothes and how expensive they were. Their sin was *pride* - not immodesty. Our confidence should come from inwards and reflect outwards. 

Just because a woman is covered and *looks* modest does not mean inside she is like that. Inwards she might feel differently. Her heart could actually be very depressed, bitter etc.Or even her actions would actually be ungodly. What I want to say here, is that it is not the *clothes* that make the woman, it's her heart, her actions, her speech. 

So should we have no rules? I'm not entirely sure, I believe women know how to dress appropriately for ocassion but what I know that the bible teaches is *self and mutual respect.*

We need to teach girls that **their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, amazing creations of God, and priceless purchases bought by Christ. Girls should learn to respect and love their bodies because they're created in the image of God.**

The purpose of the human body is to bear that sacred image, in a dark, crazy world. That's what we should be telling girls, and also boys.


Edit:

Please note this comes from experience. I was sexually abused as a child. So I know how it feels, and that it was not my fault. Not the clothes I wore, not my body, but it was the sin in the respective man.  And yes I've forgiven him, because I know the Lord knows and that He is just. He has forgiven my many sins and I will praise Him forever more. My freedom comes from Him and from forgiveness. And I will not be ashamed of who I am now in Jesus. I am a new creation as all believers are. And my body is not who I am, my identity in Christ is who I am. Who we all are.

About 9 months ago my father was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer. Ever since then, he's lost a lot of weight and his energy level has tanked. It's extremely hard to see him in his old clothes, and seeing how loose they are around his arms and legs. It's affecting is us all a lot and keeps our minds occupied.

Tomorrow he will get a scan that will ultimately decide what treatment possibilties are still possible. Currently, no treatment has worked and the only treatment that would work.. Well, odds are slim of him surviving that, or even being in a good enough shape for him to get selected for it. From a human perspective; he's terminal, the odds are not in his favor and the prognosis isn't good.

It is hard for me to think about anything else right now, and I just pray and hope that whatever will come out of that test can give us some shimmer of hope; and if not, that we as a family atleast can spend proper time together and talk things through properly.

GerbilNinja27,0.0,255.0," John Spencer Lucas III died peacefully in his sleep last night. He and his wife (my grandmother) knew each other for over 50 years, starting off as friends in childhood. At 19, my grandma married off to grandpa and they had 3 children, Samuel, John, and Elizabeth. These are my uncles and Elizabeth is my mother. Then my mother found a man, my father, and they conceived me and my younger brother. The usual chain of things followed in the family. 

Grandpa was a firefighter, a job who surprisingly many people forget the bravery and danger of. My grandma was a nurse, delivering new lives into the world. This means their children were left at home sometimes, with the eldest child John (commonly called Johnny by the family) was in charge. Both parents would get home tired but have the weekends free. They lived in a cozy house by the beach, one which many memories were made. Photography was another hobby for grandpa, and he sometimes did this professionally as well. It was his greatest passion, watching his children (and soon grandchildren) grow up, and recording it all as memories.

The beach was one of his favorite spots to go and make sandcastles with me, my brother, and cousins. Then we would go back to the house and enjoy a dinner on the patio and sometimes stay the night. Almost everyone my grandfather met would become his friend sooner or later. An example of this is a woman who lived down the street whose legs were too unstable to walk around on her own, so he would help her by driving her around wherever she wanted. He did this on on Tuesdays, every week. When his own father (my great grandfather) had Parkinson's that got to severe was unable to move out of his home alone, he also did the same thing by making sure they did something fun and unique every week.

After his father and mother died, grandpa shed the only tear he ever shed, because he had a disorder where he could not cry. After this, he continued to help others. He received plaques for his donated blood, so much was given from him that my mother once exclaimed, ""Daddy, soon you'll run out!"" He was a true Christian who really would gives the clothes off his back to someone who needed it. For the homeless people on the streets, my father was always skeptical of them, saying ""Who knows, they could be rich and earning money off of lies! I can't take the risk, I'll give them food but not money. Otherwise they could go and blow it all off on alcohol and drugs."" My grandpa was not like this. One day while walking down the street with my father, he handed a $20 bill to a man holding a sign. My father informed him this was foolish, but he just replied ""It's between them and God if they are telling the truth. I'd rather give money to an imposter than refuse to give to those who really need it.""

In my early childhood years, me and grandpa would do ""flashlight adventures"" when it was dark, with me and him sneaking out and searching the unknown with a flashlight in each hand. We once found a fish skeleton, adding it to the list of 'treasures.' Our relationship grew as I aged. Unfortunately, bad news came the day my brother was born. I didn't know about this on our times together, because it was too hard to notice for quite a while. He had Parkinson's. A terrible disease, seemingly harmless at first. His hands would shake at the most random of times, but he would steady them. Sitting in his car by the park, just me and him, I asked why his hands shook. He chuckled and replied ""I have Parkinson's.""

Years later, the blood clots started on one of his legs. He landed in the hospital and they seemingly fixed it. From then on he was never quite as strong physically. After that he got blood clots in the other leg, which forced him to sit down every now and then so they wouldn't swell up. After a while grandpa and his wife moved into a condo because the house by the beach was too much for them to keep up with. The condo was so much smaller and I hated it because the nostalgia from the old house plagued me. Moving in with their cat Guinndillane and their Aubie the trusty dog, they settled in. After an even longer time, the doctors agreed that the blood clots could not be removed because a growth in his brain could be disrupted, removing his memory. It would be too great of a loss, so offers for surgery were denied.

Much later, grandpa collapsed while trying to get into bed. The ambulance had to come over there three times already, but this was the most severe. They took him to the hospital and kept him there for a couple weeks. Because of coronavirus they only allowed one person at a time to visit. He would hallucinate some days, imagining that he was bleeding or colorful bubbles were floating in the air. A UTI (urinary tract infection) was discovered during his time at the hospital. They tried to remove and another one emerged. He was moved to a rehabilitation facility, which only allowed one 15 minute visit per week. Besides that you could stand by the windows outside to look in on patients. Me and my family would come to deliver milkshakes to him during this time. And we stood to talk with him on the phone as often as possible.

After months, grandpa's wish finally came true. He was allowed to go back to the condo, although he had to lay on a hospital bed in the middle of the living room. He was positioned to look out at the ocean and the TV. We would go over there to see him in person again. Some days were horrible where he would shake violently at night, not sleeping for up to two days. Others were good, where he was lucid and able to talk. At Thanksgiving he was able to pray for the food, saying ""Dear Lord, thank you for this meal and this wonderful time together. Please bless me and my family with all of your might."" Through all this time, however, he stayed in bed. Stacks upon stacks of pills lined the tables, none of which seemed to be working. He would have trouble eating, as his sense of taste was messed up.

Eventually I discovered that he had not eaten for 4 days. Knowing this would kill him if kept up, I prayed hospice would provide an IV. They didn't. Hospice cares for a patient's comfort, not care. Grandma was able to get a few drops of protein drink into him, but it wasn't much. He was already skin and bones, but by then the statement was very literal. The last words I heard from him were, ""It was good to see you. I love you."" ""I love you too,"" I replied. Yesterday Christmas carolers came in to sing songs to him, and he tried to sing along, but he was too weak.  I prayed for days and days to God to heal him, including last night. In the morning I was told he was found unresponsive. Rest in peace, wonderful man.

He now can run with no hinderance, talk with no murmuring, and celebrate with the Lord. His last words were to my grandma. She asked, ""Are you ready to see Jesus, Spencer?"" He replied with his eyes closed and slightly smiled, whispering ""*Always.*""

roguewizard1015,0.0,250.0,"I just wanted to share this in a community that would understand. 

I have struggled with mental illness since I was a kid. I had three suicide attempts as a middle schooler due to bullying. I found my faith originally just before my third one. When I went to go through with it, I felt God with me and stopped. 

Fast forward to adulthood. My dad passed away when I was 19 (I'm 23 now). After that and a few other traumas, I did everything I could to numb myself and was on the path to becoming an alcoholic. I got so good at being numb, I stopped making connections with people and in turn lost my faith in God. I lived in constant anxiety from my OCD. I have been in therapy for the past year or so though which helped lead me to where I am now. 

A few weeks ago, I prayed for the first time in a long time. I prayed that God would help me not be numb anymore. I felt my walls shatter almost instantly.

It was almost too much to handle when my feelings came back. It was like I felt all my sadness, anger, joy, grief, etc come back all at once. I had a bit of a mental breakdown. But I felt God with me. He led me to a mental hospital. I stayed there for a week or so. 

I have kept praying and listening to Him. Since then, my boyfriend is now my fiance. He lead us both to a church that my dad's old best friend preaches at. We are joining by Baptism in a couple weeks. I have found a wonderful job and will hopefully be going back to school in October. I have learned to reconnect with people again. My mental health is completely manageable now, and I don't feel as though I need alcohol to function anymore. 

I fully believe if God hadn't worked the way He did, or if I hadn't had listened, I would be dead by my own hand. God works in mysterious ways, and I couldn't be more thankful to Him or more thankful for my faith.",Christianity,Rededicated to my faith after God saved me from suicide.,250.0,0.99

themsc190,0.0,257.0,"I‚Äôm coining the term Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Gay (n.) to describe a phenomenon I‚Äôve encountered countless times during my years of debating homosexuality in this sub.

It describes the contradictory and mutually exclusive attacks on a gay user (often me) within just seconds of one another. 

**Example 1:**

&gt;Them: You‚Äôre ignorant of the Bible. If you just read it and study these passages, you‚Äôll see that the Bible clearly condemns homosexuality. 

&gt;Me: I‚Äôve actually been studying this issue for over a decade. I‚Äôm well aware of what the Bible says.

&gt;Them: See, that‚Äôs the issue. You‚Äôve studied it *too much* and you‚Äôre overcomplicating things. 

**Example 2:**

&gt;Them: You‚Äôre just gay because it‚Äôs the easy road. Jesus said to take up your cross and that there will be troubles if you follow him. 

&gt;Me: Actually, becoming a gay-affirming Christian has been a troublesome road. I‚Äôve lost family and friends. I‚Äôm following Christ‚Äôs call for justice and l‚Äôm carrying my cross, just like he said to do.

&gt;Them: The troubles you‚Äôre encountering are God trying to correct you and get you back on the right path. 

**Example 3:**

&gt;Them: This gay-affirming church is shrinking ‚Äî must be because they‚Äôre abandoning the Word of God. 

&gt;Them later: This gay-affirming church is growing ‚Äî that‚Äôs just because they‚Äôre pandering to itching ears. 

In these examples, I both *haven‚Äôt* read the Bible enough *and* have read it too much. My alleged *lack* of hardships means I‚Äôm not following Christ, *and* my hardships mean I‚Äôm not following Christ. Gay-affirming churches shrinking means they‚Äôre falling away, *and* gay-affirming churches growing means they‚Äôre falling away.

The only explanation is that these heuristics, the content of these critiques, *don‚Äôt actually mean anything*. I‚Äôm the enemy, I‚Äôm in the wrong, no matter if these critiques apply to me or not! The logic is going backwards, starting with ‚Äúme being wrong‚Äù and then backing into a critique of me that can shift and mutate *depending on any single set of facts about me*. 

Christians (or any rational thinkers) should never have a ready-made conclusion and work backwards into their arguments. It‚Äôs facially anti-intellectual. And when the conclusion is about *another human being who bears the image of God*, then it is patently unloving as well.

i ain‚Äôt telling you to sin, Just don‚Äôt overthink it. God loves you, he ain‚Äôt against he‚Äôs for you. David killed a man n stole his wife. but he repented realized what he did was wrong n turned from it. Fear of the Lord is good which brings peace n understanding not constant dread n anxiety.

The Spirit of the Lord is not fear n timidness but it is power love n self discipline. Christ died for you for a reason. Myself included we all need to be a little more lighthearted n easygoing. We are Christians. That makes us different from the world n if you still living in constant dread you ain‚Äôt different. Ain‚Äôt nobody going to want to be Christian when they see us judging and afraid out of our mind. 

1 John 4:18 
There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.

John 14:27
27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.

Matthew 20:28

Isaiah 35:4
say to those with fearful hearts, ‚ÄúBe strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you.‚Äù

Isaiah 41:13
For I am the Lord your God
    who takes hold of your right hand
and says to you, Do not fear;
    I will help you.

Ecclesiastes 7:15-18
15 In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these:
the righteous perishing in their righteousness,
    and the wicked living long in their wickedness.
16 Do not be overrighteous,
    neither be overwise‚Äî
    why destroy yourself?
17 Do not be overwicked,
    and do not be a fool‚Äî
    why die before your time?
18 It is good to grasp the one
    and not let go of the other.
    Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.

Ecclesiastes 9:10-11
9 You who are young, be happy while you are young,
    and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth.
Follow the ways of your heart
    and whatever your eyes see,
but know that for all these things
    God will bring you into judgment.
10 So then, banish anxiety from your heart
    and cast off the troubles of your body,
    for youth and vigor are meaningless.

For the fear of God brings wisdom, confidence, courage, refuge, n peace that transcends all human understanding in Christ. 
That is why we boldly proclaim the Word of God because of the confidence we have in our salvation!

Isaiah 33:6
And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.

Proverbs 14:26
In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence, And 
his children will have refuge.

I'm not saying don't vote, but it would be healthy for Christianity as a whole if we all dropped the constantly political talk and focused more on what God thinks, not us.

On the surface it seems the Sin of Gluttony is about food and not binging on it, or over eating.

However I am observing that the Sin likely does and should apply to everything that you could possibly binge on. In particular, certain activities that shouldn't be consumed in succession for hours and hours with no break and no by product from creation.

What I mean by this is that we should not just make sure we don't over eat. We should also pay mind to what activities we are doing and not over consume them as well. Watching Netflix, watching Music Videos, playing video games, listening to music, etc. Even reading books (while arguably better than the others) needs to be tapered off at a point. Not only does consuming these activities endlessly damage your mind in the form of endless dopamine rushes, you are often left with nothing to show for the time spent.

It would be far better to be in a mode of creation. You could learn to play an instrument, or build a video game. At least you would have something to show for the time spent and could possibly even sell these things and support your family.

my_words_,0.0,231.0,"I‚Äôm a high school senior, so this time was/is a little bit confusing for me. College decisions are being released, and in a few weeks, I will have to commit to a school I am accepted into. You might dismiss what I have to say because I am only a high school senior, but I came to relive and relearn something. 

I believe myself to be a decent student ‚Äî not the top student, but above average, within the top 5% of my class ‚Äî who has a decent resume of extracurricular activities. 

Two days ago, a college rejected me. Yesterday, one college waitlisted me and another rejected me. Then, two colleges waitlisted me and another rejected me. Sounds bleak, I know. But because of my fear of being rejected, I grew more desperate for the Lord‚Äôs guidance and his help. 

At first my prayers were filled with ‚ÄúFather God, I would like to go to X college or Y university,‚Äù and/or something along the lines of, ‚ÄúPlease let me get accepted.‚Äù And then they evolved to ‚ÄúFather God, I would like to go to X college or Y university. Please show me Your grace.‚Äù My prayers slowly started changing until they became ‚ÄúFather God, let Your will be done. Wherever I am meant to go, please guide me.‚Äù I started changing from this concept of ‚Äúmy wants‚Äù to ‚ÄúHis plan.‚Äù 

And then, today, I got my acceptance. Amidst all my ‚Äúworldly failures‚Äù, God never forgot me. I still am waiting on results, and I still get uneasy every time they are to release, but God has given me peace and put my heart at rest. He got me through this, and he‚Äôll get me through the rest.

Whenever things don‚Äôt go my way, almost as if on instinct, I almost always first looked to God; not to ask Him for guidance, no. I tried to blame Him at first because it‚Äôs always easier to do that then face reality. This life I live is to be one that is God-centered, not self-centered. I am not that person anymore. It isn‚Äôt the college season that constantly reminds me to live for God. Everything that surrounds me always points to God ‚Äî as our Creator, Savior, and awesome Father. I will work until that wherever I look, I first see the Lord‚Äôs power and the beauty of His creations.

Regardless of whatever came my way ‚Äî physical injuries, emotional pain, other struggles ‚Äî  God always protected me. He always heard my prayers before I thought or said them. He is an omnipotent, omniscient God. Praise to the Father, now and forever. 

Thank you for reading. üôèüèª

SantaTheArianSlapper,0.0,232.0,"The chances of me ending up here were pretty low. Here in Eastern Scotland, especially in urban areas religion is nearly unheard of among young people and our once strong Christian heritage is quickly being forgotten. For most of my life I was an atheist, for a lot of that a rather toxic one who frequented r/atheism, watched too much amazing atheist and was generally a bit of a prick to the relatively few religious people I encountered.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully through the grace of God several years ago I was able to remove myself from my old ways and come to Christ and have been a Christian since (though admittedly probably not a fantastic one). Because of this I have experienced the shunning of many former friends and some family who rather dislike my new religious convictions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I've moved around a good bit the last few years and switched between a good few churches in an attempt where I should be I've not been able to establish a strong church community and with the relatively new lockdown here I feel completely alone in my faith which is compounded by my imminent international move off to the US so it doesn't make sense to build a community here when I wont be here in a few months. It's a rather weird way to be when a lot of my experience of religion these days is found on the internet and it feels extremely isolating.

LumpyWin5,0.0,227.0,"So I grew was raised in a non religious family. My father is a non believer and my moms faith isn't very strong. I always remember being curious about God but being hesitant to really believe because of the questions I had. I wasn't sure how god could let so many bad things happen in a world where he supposedly loves everybody. And there are many things that are in the bible that I don't agree with. I thought that this would hold me back and I wouldn't be able to believe unless I believed in every single thing the bible said. 

But today, with resent times I wasn't having a good day and I came down to my room at the end of the night and I just felt empty, like nothing I did really mattered. And for some reason I had this urge to google ""Why does god allow bad?"" I found this video on youtube and it was a sermon from a pastor somewhere, and it was beautiful, in no way did it answer all my questions but when the video finished I pressed another and another and finally I got to one about the power of your prayers and it as inspiring. After the video I felt like I had to do it. So I just closed my laptop needled on my bed and put my hands together ( I know this is really cliche but I haven't been taught how to pray so this is the only way I have seen in movies before). I didn't pray for anything big just for the health and safety of health care workers, especially my aunt who just traveled to NY to help in hospitals there and then for strength for my and my mom to get through a tough time. I have not clue if I did it right and I don't really know how I feel about it yet, but afterwards my eyes filed with tear and I cried for a bit but they were good tears I felt free. 

My only reservation is that I still have so many questions I like the connection I felt like I had tonight but there are so many things within christianty I don't agree with and I feel like I can finally say I believe in god, but i still don't know if I can call myself Christian.

So, for the sake of their happiness, I would try to pray (did not last long) and recite the Quran (have done so x 3 times in my lifetime). However, despite having the prayers memorized, I did not know what they translated to. And, despite reciting the Quran x 3 times, I did not know what I was reading. Both these things were in Arabic, and I only knew how to read Arabic NOT understand it. But, growing up, I was told that these things would give me a seat in Heaven, and therefore, I should do them. But, I wanted something more. I did not care about Heaven, I cared about God. I wanted to know God. I wanted to be on fire for God. It was God I wanted, not Heaven.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, all these things that I did, did not draw me closer to Allah. I did not do them often; however, even when I did do them, I did not feel any form of emotional connection. I felt absolutely nothing. Therefore, I decided that these things did not matter, and I could simply continue living life praying to Allah by talking to him. Thus, I talked to Allah every day, all day. For as long as I could remember, maybe since high school, I was consistently talking to Allah. However, for as long as I could remember, I lived with complete doubt, hopelessness, anger, and frustration. You see, I was someone who was dying inside to have a connection with God. I was so thirsty to know him. I wanted him so badly, and I felt completely betrayed because no matter how much I prayed, I felt empty.

&amp;#x200B;

My prayers and daily conversations with God felt hollow. They felt broken, unheard, and wasteful. I was in this constant struggle because I wanted to believe in something greater than I, there must be. But, Allah never answered me. I was so agonized by my thirst for God that I became suicidal and hopeless. I was consistently crying during my conversations, begging Allah to give me SOMETHING. Give me a sign, even the smallest. Give me a dream, give me some form of connection. Help me to find you, please. I wondered how could Allah leave me in this trembling state of abandonment? Did he not love me?

&amp;#x200B;

I soon grew anger and resentment towards Allah, but I still ‚Äò‚Äôbelieved‚Äô‚Äô in him regardless of how hollow I felt. However, my anger was stronger. Each time something did not go my way, the blame was Allah. I would be quick to shift responsibility when things would go wrong. If I received a B+ in class, it was Allah‚Äôs fault. If I got into an argument with my parents, it was Allah‚Äôs fault. I would curse Allah, and I would throw my frustration at him. I would tell him I hate him, and then hours later, cry and beg for forgiveness only to do it again the next day. I realized later on that I had no respect for Allah, nor did I truly fear Allah‚Ä¶ Nor did I love Allah. I wanted to love Allah to the deepest of my core, but there was nothing there. I also realized how much of an envious, lustful, uncaring, angered individual I was. However, I lived my life knowing that Allah would forgive me if I continued to do good deeds over bad ones. I could continue doing all the bad that I could do as long as I did more good things‚Ä¶ And this destroyed me even more because deep down, I always questioned whether I was a decent human being. How could Allah be proud of me? I wasn‚Äôt proud of myself. How could Allah love me? I did not love me. How could Allah say that this woman belongs in Heaven? I was not a good enough person to belong there.

&amp;#x200B;

After 21 years, I gave up on Islam. I could not believe in Allah anymore. I felt no connection. I felt detached and broken, and I knew that praying to Allah would not get me anymore. Therefore, I decided to just believe that there was a greater being who created me and all of the universe. At first, it was scary. I was so used to saying I was Muslim to everyone who asked about my religion that at times, I would hesitate. I also was so afraid because of my whole life, I had believed Allah was God. I also knew that my family would be disappointed and disown me if they ever found out I had left Islam. It took me several months to be open about me leaving this faith to coworkers and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I quickly realized that I felt no different than how I felt when I was believing in Allah. Merely believing in a higher being was doing nothing for me. I felt the same brokenness and hollowness that I felt when I prayed to Allah. I felt the same anger and anguish that I had felt when I prayed to Allah. If there was a higher being out there that created me, I still had no respect for them and would curse them when things did not go my way. Nothing changed. And yet, I continued to believe that there was a higher being despite all these things.

&amp;#x200B;

A year goes by, and my close friend pressured me into reading about Jesus. I told my friend that I would never believe in Jesus Christ ever. I only knew of Jesus, because I grew up in America, and many people followed him. I did not know if he was God, or simply a son of God, or just a person. I knew nothing, but I refused to follow him. I told my friend that I promise him I would never believe in Jesus Christ. I knew nothing of the Bible, or what Christianity was about. But, within that same week of arguing with my friend and telling my friend that I would never believe, I laid in my bed, crossed my hands together, and prayed, saying something along the lines of:

    Dear God, I don‚Äôt know what exactly to believe. I have felt so lost and incomplete for so long. I have no guidance or direction of where to go. I am tired of this brokenness. If you are out there, please just give me a sign of where to go.

&amp;#x200B;

During that same night, I had a dream of me praying on a tree-stump in front of a river. Funny thing was, the same prayer I had prayed that night, was the same prayer I prayed in my dream. Once the prayer was finished in my dream, a bright light surrounded me as I said ‚Äò‚ÄôJesus.‚Äô‚Äô

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this meant something to me. However, I was still not fully convinced. The same week, I began to cry. I began to cry because I partially believed in Jesus, but my other half was afraid. After reading a few things, I realized that to follow Jesus, I had to give up on a lot of things. Many of these things were my sins, which I believed were ingrained in me and were a part of who I was. I was an envious, lustful person. I lied almost daily. I had a habit of these things, and I truly thought that I could never give my life to Christ because I could never stray away from these things. The same night I was crying, I had another dream:

&amp;#x200B;

    In this dream, I saw a statue of Jesus Christ. It was that simple, just Jesus Christ. The rest of the area was pitch black. And in that dream, I heard someone say in the background, ‚Äò‚ÄôHow much do you love my Son?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

That was it. This was the one dream that truly moved me. I want to also emphasize the fact that it was not just the dream that moved me toward Christ. But, I also felt a connectedness I had never felt before. I had felt a love I had never felt before. You see, for 22 years, I had sought an answer from both Allah and simply a ‚Äò‚Äôhigh-being.‚Äô‚Äô For 22 years, I had felt empty and detached. For 22 years, I was just so desperate to finding something to give my life purpose and meaning. However, no matter how much I prayed before, I had never felt what I felt when I gave my life to Jesus Christ. All this in a week, and all this the same week I had repeatedly told my friend that I would never believe in Christ. I ate my own words.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, before, I continued to believe that if I did the right things, I could also do the wrong things. What was bad about this? It destroyed me. My enviousness destroyed me. How could I claim to care for my friends, but then not hope the best for them? My lustfulness destroyed me. How could I love my boyfriend, yet think of other men in the back of my mind? My lying destroyed me. How could I claim that others loved me when whom they loved was just a phony image I created? My greediness destroyed me. How could I be thankful for what I have, while wishing I had what others did? All these things strayed me away from being like Christ: holy, good, love, peace, forgiveness‚Ä¶ And, they ruined me. They made me second-guess who I was as a person. I hated me.

&amp;#x200B;

Islam had taught me that it was okay to continue being a sinner, even if it involved killing my soul and who I was completely. Almost as if it is okay to be a drug addict until it ruins you and destroys every relation you have with the ones you love.

&amp;#x200B;

 How could I ever be proud of who I am as a human being if I could never fix the underlying problems that were me? Why would I even care to change them if ‚Äò‚ÄôGod‚Äô‚Äô did not care? I had no motivation to change because nothing required me to changed. I was not strong enough to change myself, and Allah did not expect me to change myself...

&amp;#x200B;

But, Jesus cares. Jesus wants me to be better. He expects me to be better. And, he loves me enough to help me to be better. And this led me to my final thing... I learned to love myself. I learned to better myself. Every day, I try to sin less than I did the day before. It is not easy, and I fail multiple times... But the simple desire to change has significantly impacted the way I view myself as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

And, unfortunately, I do not have all the answers. A few years ago, if someone told me this exact story, I still would not believe in Christ Jesus. Plenty of atheists and other religious individuals point out valid arguments and questions that I simply do not know the answer to. And sometimes, even I have my doubts, and I ask questions on here that I do not find satisfying answers to.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot tell you why people suffer. I cannot tell you why children have cancer. I cannot tell you if there is evidence for Christ. I am sorry. These are all questions that I also wished I had answers to, but I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ And I am naive, and therefore, I am also not the best person to ask. But I am now content in my faith, something I have been longing for more than I had ever longed for anything in my lifetime. What I feel is real, a true sense of love. At times, I even cry in my car while driving home, because of the immense peace and love that I feel from my Lord‚Ä¶ This was something I never envisioned myself having. I am truly in a better place knowing that what I have sought so long has been received. I can only pray that those who long the same, will one day receive it as well.

MRH2,0.0,210.0,"When I look at birds, they make me praise God.

We have some American robins nesting outside our window. Their instincts are incredible. The mother bird knows when to sit on the eggs to keep them warm, and when to got off of them when it's really hot. The male and female both know where their nest and babies are and instinctively feed the baby birds instead of just looking after themselves. They instinctively protect their babies too. Many birds have the instinct to act injured to lead a predator away from the nest! Even sacrificing their lives if necessary. Speaking of predators, all our garden birds instinctively know that cats are predators and will fly up to the branches and screech to warn other birds that there is danger.  How does a bird which might have never seen a cat before, know that it is a deadly killer? There are so many other instincts: building a nest out of twigs, grass, and mud, just using their beaks. I couldn't do that using only my teeth - and I'm a lot smarter than a bird. They know where to build nests, when to build them and when not to.  Somehow they learn to fly. And they have an instinct to migrate south in autumn and north in spring. There are probably tons of other instincts that I'm not aware of or thinking of : like knowing what food is good and where to get it (eg. eating seeds rather than sand). They have such tiny brains and can do so much.

God's creation is marvellous and spectacular if you take time to stop and observe. I've just begun to touch on the wonderful intricate beauty that God has created in birds.

I commented on a post a day or so back about /r/atheism being a fast rising subreddit.

I am in most ways an atheist. I don't believe in god, I believe when we die there is nothing, I believe that good and evil aren't acts of god or satan, but more acts of the individual or circumstance.

That all said, I put across my viewpoints in the post and was open to a good discussion without name calling or the general hate we all see across reddit when someone shares a different view..

I was aware that I was in 'Your house' so to speak. I was arguing against the majority (as a non believer in a christianity subreddit) and I was fully prepared to be called names, to be told I was an idiot, to be labelled a bad person, to be chastised etc etc..

But I wasn't.

I entered into a great discussion and was pleasantly surprised with the user I was talking to (Thanks again /u/Broccoli-Robby).

It doesn't stop there though. I read through the other comments, from people with various beliefs and backgrounds and opinions, and for the most part I found similar interactions in the comments.

They did not want to hear that God would give miraculous preference to Gentiles over Jews. Why would God be doing something miraculous somewhere else and not with the elect?  They didn't like that perhaps Jesus was saying they would get skipped too. He saw something in them and Matthew sheds some light on what it was:

Matthew 13:58 ""And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.""

May we not adhere to doctrines that let us feel ok about **our** lack of faith and that cause us to crush self-righteously anyone who hints at any supernaturality. And may we not lead others down that same path of unbelief. Lord help us.

The following point is about those who do have faith that God still works, yet still haven't seen the supernatural. C.S. Lewis wrote in his book on Miracles:

""You are probably quite right in thinking that you will never see a miracle done: \[. . .\] They come on great occasions: they are found at the great ganglions of history‚Äînot of political or social history, but of that spiritual history which cannot be fully known by men. If your own life does not happen to be near one of those ganglions, how should you expect to see one? If we were heroic missionaries, apostles, or martyrs, it would be a different matter. But why you or I? Unless you live near a railway, you will not see trains go past your windows. How likely is it that you or I will be present when a peace-treaty is signed, when a great scientific discovery is made, when a dictator commits suicide? That we should see a miracle is even less likely. Nor, if we understand, shall we be anxious to do so. ‚ÄúNothing almost sees miracles but misery.‚Äù Miracles and martyrdoms tend to bunch about the same areas of history‚Äîareas we have naturally no wish to frequent.""

He talked about our natural tendency to avoid those levels of commitment where miracles are taking place. But even a bright mind like his did not dare to dismiss the supernatural as something that has ceased. He was humble enough to recognize that perhaps he just wasn't involved enough.

The Lord is still very much at work in the world, through His Holy Spirit, in the Name of Jesus.

HownTomfi,0.0,209.0,"Merry Christmas, brethren,

I write to you in order to express my deeply confounded stress and confusion when it comes to the matter of religion, spirituality and God.

For years during my youth I would question everything, and I believe that questioning everything is a GOOD THING. However, I was seeking for answers in dark places. I eventually turned my back against God and Jesus. I would even go as far as to make fun of the entire concept of there being a divine Creator of the Universe.

Slowly, this lack of faith drove me to find answers in places that are there for the sole purpose to lead people astray. I spent the last 3 to 4 years following New Age spirituality, finally thinking to myself-- yes, this is it, this is what I have been yearning for. It took me all this time to finally come to the conclusion that New Age spirituality is a load of pseudo-science prepped up to make you ""feel good"". Yes, you end up ""feeling good"", but the problem with that is that you end up believing in a myriad of logical inconsistencies and believing in an amalgamation of many different religions and philosophies. And while I personally believe reading up on different religions is a net-positive (in particular all 3 major Abrahamic religions), at the end of the day, you have to decide which one resonates with you the most.

I've had a hard life-- to the point where I did not know what was up, or down, and New Age/Atheism did not save me from having constant headaches from trying to figure out everything.

My life has led me through some hard and difficult tribulations-- the final straw for me was when my life was in immediate danger. What led me to leave atheism behind, and start reconsidering my faith in Christianity, was when my life was at stake. As an atheist, I thought, perhaps God can save me. In a break of tears, I decided to give out a heartfelt, and genuine prayer. I prayed to God, and called upon St. Michael to guide me and to provide me with safety-- to protect me from the enemy plotting to cause me harm.

It was at that moment that I saw a sign-- clear as day. As I stopped my crying, and I opened my eyes immediately after praying to God and St. Michael, I saw an orb of shining blue light, hovering in my living room. It hovered across my living room, and landed on the kitchen table, right above a red towel. I was in awe over what I had witnessed. Needless to say, it seems to have worked, and my life was not in danger soon after the prayer.

But that journey that began in that moment in time did not immediately lead me to Christ. I spent years searching explanations to what I had witnessed, resorting to finding New Age descriptions of the Archangel Michael, believing that yes, while I may have seen (or what I think I had seen) Michael the Archangel, sadly, to me it was not enough to return to the grace of Christ, God's only begotten son.

It took me a long time to internalize and accept that what I had seen, perhaps I will never be able to properly explain. But you know what? Perhaps that was the point of the entire experience. To show me that, no, I will never have all the answers. And that is OK. I accept that I am not a gatekeeper of Truth.

It has taken me a long, long time to finally get back to accepting the Holy Trinity as One. I believe this is a perfect time to begin my transition to becoming a devout follower and student of Christ.

I apologize for the extremely long post. It is the night after Christmas, and I have purchased my first KJV Study Bible to begin my spiritual journey as a Christian.

I greet all of you with a warm hello, and perhaps will begin lurking this forum more often.

doomedson,0.0,199.0,"Before I became a Christian, I dabbled in the occult when I was younger. My family was Christian in culture, but this faded from us for varying reasons.

I stepped away and became more atheistic as time went on. Before long I had slipped from an agnostic to an atheist. With this in mind I began to explore other religions, finding them more interesting than serious. Something to explore along a fictional guidelines. I became a Levayan satanist in an ‚Äúedgy, gothic, sithlord wearing black‚Äù sort of way. Not believing that the religion was more than a mascot for atheism. 

I later met other satanists when I joined the military, realized it was a horrible movement with no actual ideas that worked out for other human beings. It was at this time I began looking into Christianity more and I gradually found my way back to it. Even to the dismay of those within the metal community I frequented. 

gradually overtime and through many hard battles fought my way back to Christ. I still struggle here and there with certain aspects of myself.

Nonetheless... I wanted to share an experience I dreamed from many months ago. It was an alarming experience and when I woke up I was a bit shaken. It was short... but wow. Just... wow.

That day I sort of.... ‚Äúfelt a temptation‚Äù to relive my older ways. The band ‚ÄúImpaled Nazarene‚Äù (Russian Black Metal band) kept coming to me to listen to. I fought the urge over and over again. Yet... I knew not to do this. I fought back against it and felt the ‚Äúpsychic push‚Äù over it all. 

Later that day I went to sleep. 

The dream was in several parts. I don‚Äôt recall the sequence of the first sets within the dream, but I recall the final act of it.

Within the dream I was in first person. My own soul contained within my own body. No subconscious images or strange memories in random chaos. When it began, I was in a wooded area, a park bench beneath me. Surrounding me were several children. I don‚Äôt remember their faces exactly besides the little Hispanic girl to my immediate left. I think she had glasses on. 

We were sitting there in normalcy and then suddenly one of them yelled ‚ÄúQuick! RUN!‚Äù All we all rose from the benches and ran towards the building that was to my immediate left. We ran up the hill and rested on the sidewalk/door area.

From where we were sitting was an open path behind us. It sort of led out into the forest. There was a streetlight above where we were. From out of the forest, walked a man. Long, blond hair, beautifully combed. Leather jacket (sort of like Emperor and Euronymous from the 90‚Äôs black metal scene).... silent and slowly stalking stride. I‚Äôm not joking... it was creepy. The look in his eyes was beyond disturbed. Serial killer energy. Like he was deeply angry at the fact that I didn‚Äôt follow through with his psychic suggestion from Sheol. Again.... beautiful and model like... but highly disturbing. 

He was wearing an Impaled Nazarene shirt in the dream. I can‚Äôt post the image here... but the band logo is exactly the same.

The dream ended right there. I woke up and just sort of dwelt on it.

Yeah.... satanic, 4th dimensional attacks are real guys. Stay on guard. The Lord and Christ protect us through dreams even to this very day and ward us away from evil. Guard yourselves. Don‚Äôt slip into older ways that once destroyed you. I know ‚Äúdreams‚Äù are flimsily things... but this felt different. 

I‚Äôve posted this before and for some reason feel compelled to share this again.

JpBlez5,0.0,199.0,"Maybe it‚Äôs because you were exposed to porn or sexual impure things for the first time when you were young, or even taken advantage of as a child or adult. When this occurs, we‚Äôre wounded,‚Äù emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. When we‚Äôre wounded we get a distorted view of God‚Äôs gift of sex, leading us to seeking the trill of sexual sin, then afterwards feeling shame and guilt. You‚Äôre not dealing with a lust issue, but a wound that has not healed yet.

Remember that we‚Äôre all warriors of God, and are meant to fight and advance his kingdom. But even warriors sometimes stumble and lose focus, due to the lustful distractions from the devil, While we‚Äôre intended to fight for his kingdom, the devil can use lustful distraction to force us off the path God has for us. So how do we get back on the path God has for us? So here‚Äôs some tips on how to stop this sin.

 1. Confess to God how to deal with guilt: 
God is faithful and just to focus if we confess. Confess for forgiveness. But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠1:9‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨. This sin grows in the dark. Even if we try to hide this sin from god, not only does he already know about it, but it says in the Bible that in the end all things will be brought to the light. But when we allow the  light of the lord is shined on this sin, and invite him to help us, the light will overcome the dark, and the darkness can never overcome it. So confess and repent of this sin now. Why would you wait to fight a future battle that you could beat through Christ now?

‚ÄúThe light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠1:5‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

2.  How to handle guilt: 
Guilt and self pity is a ploy by the devil to keep you away from God. When we feel guilty or self pity, it is a form of self punishment, used to make ourselves feel like we‚Äôre punishing ourselves. When you do this, instead of focusing on the free gift of salvation God gave us, all you focus on is yourself, and punishing yourself. Remember Jesus died you we didn‚Äôt have to face any punishment for sin, but that we could be free from sin. so stand up brother and accept his forgiveness and repent, for you have been forgiven. 

‚ÄúOh but I‚Äôve done it so much‚Äù,or ‚Äúmy sin is to great‚Äù. This doesn‚Äôt mean a thing. Jesus defeated sin and death on the cross. Neither then or now can any of these things compare to the name of Jesus. You sin may be big, but your God is bigger. Goliath was big, but God was bigger. Also Jesus is faithful to forgive us of our trespasses as many times as we need to be forgiven of them( this doesn‚Äôt however excuse you from not repenting, for Gods kindness is intended to lead us to repentance, from Romans 2:4).


3. Confess to the right people: James tell us to confess our sins to one another, and when we do this, we have healing. Iron sharpens iron as a friend sharpens a friend( Proverbs 27:17). We don‚Äôt just need our bride, we need fellow men or women, people who can keep us accountable.  and when we do this, we have healing. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.  Let‚Äôs not neglect the impact of talking to each other, sharpening each other, and talking about our sins to each other, which will bring healing. This sin grows best in the dark, especially in the darkness of unaccountability and away from God. Sometimes that accountability can make us have more urgency to not fall. If You need to go to rehab, counseling, marriage counseling, you gotta do what you gotta do.

4. Know your triggers: If you continue to fall on the same path, get off the path. If it‚Äôs an app you scroll that makes you fall stop looking at it. If it‚Äôs you being alone in your room, or something you‚Äôre reading, etc, cut off all the things that make you fall. Jesus said if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. That‚Äôs how serious we need to treat this sin. If something causes us to trip, get rid of it. We can‚Äôt make lustful thoughts just stop. You‚Äôre  always potential vulnerable to this sin. Satan will place land mines for us, and we must be wise and honest enough to know our triggers and avoid them. We have to be honest with ourselves about what triggers us, and work around them and allow God to help us. Always be weary of the enemy, for he,s like a roaring lion, he crawls around like a lion waiting to devour someone. A lion never attacks prey that can resist its fangs and avoid its traps, and likewise if we resist and avoid the devils attacks, he‚Äôll leave us alone( ‚ÄúSo humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.‚Äù James‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4:7‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Never feel entitled to sin because others do it, and never feel overconfident or feel you don‚Äôt need to follow your triggers. You‚Äôre only making yourself more vulnerable. You‚Äôre leaving the door wide open for temptation to swept you away a storm. You‚Äôre only as strong as you are honest.

5. Let God heal the wound: Like I said earlier  You‚Äôre not dealing with a lust issue, but a wound that has not healed yet. This fight won‚Äôt be easy, we may fight it our whole lives, but in Christ there‚Äôs freedom, joy, true sexual intimacy, true intimacy with your spouse, and true love. Warriors, you‚Äôre not weak, your not a victim, you deny yourself and make sacrifices, you never surrender. The only thing we have to and need to surrender to is God who promises to guide us through this fight. You can do all things through him who gives you strength. If you need healing, go to him who heals all wounds. If you need to surrender to God, surrender yourself and this sin to him who shows mercy. Your head is a battle field, you are the commander of your mind, not a slave of it. The same spirit that rose Christ from the grave is in you. You may stumble yeah, you rise up anyway. A warrior may not win every battle, but they don‚Äôt stop fighting. This sin has no hold on you. Through the freedom and victory from Christ‚Äôs sacrifice, victory is yours.

‚ÄúHe heals the brokenhearted and bandages their wounds.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Psalms‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠147:3‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨


‚ÄúNo, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.‚Äù

[deleted],0.0,194.0,"My testimony: My name is Sarah. I am a 28 year old hospice Nurse. I have worked as a nurse with the dying for 10 years. My entire teen life I was into the supernatural, ghost hunting, magic, occult, etc. as I aged I became an atheist because I thought ‚Äúi am a hospice nurse and I‚Äôve never seen a ghost. This must be bullsh ‚Äú Also all those science courses and fellow peers got me feeling stupid for believing in God. So I rejected Christians as brainwashed, uneducated. (sound familiar? Thats the sound of Reddit saying that to us. I believed it, until the unexplainable happened)

I‚Äôve been through a lot. Alcoholic dad died when I was 22 (the day before my birthday), mom is homeless since he died (still homeless to this day, years later ) and my brother and 4 year old son both got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I also totaled my car I didn‚Äôt pay off. So at work one of my patients died, and I was sitting alone at my desk flipping through Genesis (there are a lot of books at the nursing home, I just chose the Bible this time out of heartbreak I was humbled I started a new) ‚Äúwhat do I know?‚Äù I asked myself. Nothing. Life NEVER goes my way. But sometimes it does... my brother and son did not die from DKA (both were found in comas with blood sugars over 1000, my son almost died and they both spend time in their respective ICU)

So I‚Äôm reading genesis, not really thinking when I just start crying as I recognized the Bible as the truth for the first time in 28 years. I can‚Äôt explain this, but I knew what I was reading is true. It's like God put a new brain inside my head at that moment. ALL of the judgement of christians and those immature atheist ideas died in that moment of humility. It‚Äôs the knowing... that was the Holy Spirit. Then I was convicted of my sin, and I repented. BRO I DIDNT KNOW WHAT THESE MEANT UNTIL AFTER IT HAPPENED TO ME! I had to look up ‚Äúbeing reborn‚Äù and I finally put words like ‚Äúconviction‚Äù and ‚Äúrepent‚Äù with my story. It began to make a clear picture. I was born again at work, out of no where. I was 28 and broken. But as a nurse I‚Äôve been serving god without even giving him credit. None of my good works mattered since I didn‚Äôt see Christ. But now I am FREE!! A lifetime of atheism, hopelessness and pain- FREE! I WILL SEE MY DAD AGAIN! My husband is still an atheist, and is confused how I was ""saved out of nowhere"". I think God had his eye on me for a LONG time. and he was workin on me! AMEN!!!!! PRAY AND OPEN YOURSELF AND HE WILL SAVE YOU! (and also when Jesus makes everything new, my 4 year old son wont have diabetes anymore. Nor will my brother.

Also yes, it is true, if you are really born again you CHANGE. I can't even listen to the same music anymore. I worked for the devil my entire life and I QUIT!

I'm tearing up as I type this. I need the blood of Christ. I'm just in a state of shock to realize how truly broken and lost I was.

Please pray for me. I'm going to pray for a long time after I post this.

AbelHydroidMcFarland,0.0,189.0,"‚ÄúSuppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one's first feeling, 'Thank God, even they aren't quite so bad as that,' or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we shall insist on seeing everything -- God and our friends and ourselves included -- as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.‚Äù",Christianity,A CS Lewis quote for both sides of the political aisle when dealing with the other side of the aisle,189.0,0.95

I had him look up ephesians 1:4 in his mom's bible, mine was in my work bag in the car.  I said think about that, God made us with no fault in his eyes.  Couple minutes pass and he says, I have a hard time believing in God. I asked him why and he says, how can you believe a book that is so old and been translated so many times.  I showed him our dictionary and how it had an addendum with words that have been added to it over the years, I explain that language evolves and that the bible has been translated over generations so each generation can understand it in their language. I then took down a fifty year old bible that belonged to my great grandfather to look up the same verse to see the different wording.  I have never opened this bible, it's been on the shelf 6 years. Ephesians 1 was bookmarked. The next day I asked if he had read the verse,  he said he opened to Matthew and the verse he read said the same thing. Sunday morning in church the pastor spoke on ephesians 1:4. I am blown away.

From what I gather by reading the gospels is that Jesus was a powerful man, that when he spoke people listened. They listened because his message was powerful. He walked through this earth leaving people stunned and in awe of him and the miracles he performed, everywhere he went.

When Jesus fed the 5,000 men (even more including women and children) with 2 fish and 5 loaves of bread, he had to be ushered away because the people wanted to take him by force and make him a king.

There was not one that came in contact with Jesus whose life wasn‚Äôt immediately changed. This man was so powerful that the kings who ruled over all were threatened by him.

JpBlez5,0.0,183.0,"When God created everything in the world in Genesis 1, he said to everything he made, ‚Äúthis is good‚Äù. When he made vegetables, plants, and food, when he made animals and sea creatures, and when he made night and day, God saw this was good. Obviously to us all these things are good and valuable, and we see the value in these things he made because he said it was good. However there‚Äôs one more thing he said was good that sometimes we don‚Äôt see value and goodness in, ourselves and other humans. When God looked at all he created, he said that it was all ‚Äúvery good‚Äù, including humans. When God created me and you, he looked at you and said, ‚Äú this is good‚Äù. You are good to him and loved by him. This shows how valuable we are to God.

When God created Adam and Eve, he placed them in charge of all the things he created. This shows how God values us more than anything else he created, animals, gold, money. It even supports this in Matthew 6:26. If you think other people are favored more by God, or others are more valuable than you, you‚Äôre completely wrong. states in the word ‚Äú‚ÄúFor God does not show favoritism.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Romans‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠2:11‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT. When you see God working in someone‚Äôs life seemingly more than yours, you must remember two things: Gods timing is perfect, and we all have a unique race set out for us by God. We may not receive blessings at the same time as others, but it doesn‚Äôt mean God isn‚Äôt working in our lives. Trust in his timing. We all have different starting pints in our walk with Christ, but how we start doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs how we finish the race. Remember that this doesn‚Äôt mean  you‚Äôre worth more than anyone, but it doesn‚Äôt make you worth less than anyone. Remember Jesus died for all of us, not for specific people.

He though you were so valuable he gave his own son, Jesus Christ do die for your sins, you so could have a chance at heaven with God.

 God truly has no reason to love us, we are sinful beings who disobey him and sometimes don‚Äôt even show him love, and yet he still wanted to be with us and loved us.

kaguragamer,0.0,179.0,"Let me tell you a bit of my backstory, i was raised a Protestant by my parents and entire family since young. I went to church regularly and didnt make much of it honestly. I believed in God but I didnt deem these weekly sessions necessary as I was young and didnt understand much and so my parents gave a very twisted and exaggerated teaching to me about ""God's laws"" and pretty much said that unless i followed them, I'm going to hell etc. I was scarred emotionally when my mother beat me up when I was 6, all i remember is that she was incensed because I for whatever reason didnt sing happy birthday and what followed was you know... Me crying.. Grandparents screaming and pounding at the door threatening to call child support or something if she didnt stop...

Fast forward when i was a teenager. During this time, I was more and more emotionally abused by my mother and literally I would have to listen to her rant everyday about how I was a useless kid who was a burden to my family, not contributing anything and I was good as dead. To add to the problem, I discovered that I was sexually attracted to people of the same gender, which in christianity as you know it is absolutely frowned upon. Being grown up in a household with both parents that are extremely homophobic and I dare say, racist towards different people just because they are black etc, i was absolutely destroyed by this and I more or less gave up my relationship with God. Why does God make me this way if he thinks its a sin? Why doesnt he change my mom? Why punish people and especially queer people to hell, didnt you make them or something why cant you just change these people if you are so powerful? I couldnt just forgive and forget 12 years where my mother basically shouted at me that I was useless 80 percent of the time while my dad just didnt know or didnt care, I couldnt just forgive the time where she told me to screw off once im 18 and that she wont give a fuck to whatever happens to me afterward. Luckily, I managed to go to boarding school back in Asia(We migrated to America when I was 14), and i wont hesitate to say that my life improved tremendously after that, at least my mental health.

During the time where I was away, I was able to do my own research and readings on the bible and the church, if you can call it that. The result was horrifying, child molestations, a church that branded women as whores simply because they cut their hair short, ""holy people"" or priests claiming to be closes to god but shaming people everywhere for literally every single act they commit and behind closed doors are an absolute dickhead that cheats on their wife and  does things they teach other people not to do. Of course these arent true for christians everywhere, but I am merely pointing this to show you that a lot of the times people have a very ugly view of christianity is because of the people who claim to be christians but actually just take God's words out of context and twists it to fit their own selfish intentions. I am disgusted of people such as these. I read the Bible many times and nowhere does it say to judge people based on their sexuality, nowhere inferring that you would go to hell just because you are black, nowhere does it say women should be treated as mere objects because they are inferior to men and a lot more what my parents and the christian community thought to me or what i took away from them when I was a child. Some churches care about its own reputation only and doesnt really care about troubled youths such as me who struggled with these kind of things when i was growing up. And all those christians who wrongfully claim that God told you that because you are a parent you can exercise whatever authority on their child and telling people they are condemmed to hell because they are a whore, please shut up. We people who do these are no better than the pharisees in the New testament. While Jesus ate and drank with people that are outcasts and women who have cheated on their husbands, these people didnt understand and insulted Jesus because he did these things. Christ doesnt teach us to drive people away from christianity and to not show any love for them just because they are horrible human beings. It teaches us to love them regardless whether they are gay or a lier etc... To hate the sin but to love the person. Easier said than done but you need to put it in practise.

I hope you all can understand. We people who call ourselves christians should act in the Lord's word and not be narrow minded as if we are the people who should judge other people about who will be saved and who wouldnt.  I have managed to live a good life and return to God and at the same time solve my own issues. I have to say that being a christian is really a privelege, though i still am not fond of the church. I am still struggling to forgive my parents for what they have done.....

Humility is one of the main characters that is required of a Christian. The Bible says in James 4:10 Humble thy self before the Lord and he will lift you up. Jesus was a man of great power, knowledge and wisdom but he was very humble.

One may ask what does it mean to be humble? It means you are confident in yourself, your talents and your skills, but you don‚Äôt go around showing off or trying to gain others‚Äô approval or applause. But it does not mean that we should deny our strengths and abilities. When asked if he was the Messiah, Jesus replied, ‚ÄúThe blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them.  And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me‚Äù Jesus did not brag about being the Messiah but in his reply one could tell he was the Messiah through the miraculous works he did.

Many may think this message is for those with wealth. Being poor does not guarantee humility.
The opposite of humility is pride. The Bible warns against proud people. Provebs 16:18 It says pride  goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. When we look at the outcomes of these characteristics we see one is positive the other very negative. 

As we go through this weekend let us be humble and if one had a spirit if pride let us pray that the Lord would have given you a spirit of humility.

Have a blessed weekend

regret-the-rapture,0.0,184.0,"This post isn't meant to start sh\*t nor is it meant as an attack on Christians. I used to be Christian and I just want a community I can confess this to since I nave no idea who would even be willing to listen. Tl;dr at the bottom for those who don't want to read much. Growing up, I was very much a Christian! I had love for Jesus and believed every word of the bible. Every Sunday was spent praising God and everyday in general would see me reading the bible front to back. I was born in 1994 and my dad was an avid follower of Dr. Mel Mulder and Harold Camping and as was I since it's all my dad allowed me to listen to. There were small things that got to me about him at first like how he would openly pray bad things happened to people he didn't like or him telling me boldly that he would murder me if God told him to but I paid it no mind since, as the bible said, honor thy father. It wasn't until 2009 that I noticed he had many books in his truck. All by Harold Camping and all detailed the supposed end of the world. I pried a bit and he told me the rapture was coming. I had always been told the rapture was coming but to be given such a clear 'we're close to this' look from him shook me to my core. This had me anxious and of course worried. Was I saved? Would Jesus spare me? I brought these concerns to my dad and he did not take well to it. He's by no means a very nice person but seeing his usual neutral scowl turn to an anger filled glare still sends chills down my spine. He didn't even say anything before yanking me by the arm, dragging me to the kitchen, and forcing me to read verses of the bible he felt conveyed whatever he wanted. Everyday he'd stop me in the middle of something and force me to read. I had loved reading the bible but now it felt...wrong. I was afraid. He'd scream at me and get so angry he'd start turning red. All i can hear from him was ""I'm not missing out on heaven because your little (slur for mentally disabled people) ass wants to be a (alternate name for a cat) so read you (slur for gay people)"". Everyday was a new screaming match and everyday was more anxiety about the rapture. Come 2010 and he started doing rapture drills. At exactly midnight every night he'd march me to the backyard and scream at me to confess my sins. If he felt i was lying or felt I sinned, he'd either beat me with his belt or hold me against the wall by my throat and scream in my face that Jesus hated me. Come 2011 and the rapture approaching, my father went into full paranoia mode. He'd count down the days to the rapture with excitement and glee saying how happy he was all the (slur for jewish people, black people, gay people, the mentally disabled, etc.) were gonna rot in hell and how Jesus would reward him personally. Months turned to weeks and weeks turned to days and days turned to hours as May 21st approached. May 21st finally arrived and my dad forced me into the living room bible in hand and began screaming ""JESUS IS COMING AMEN"" over and over and over for hours until day went into the night and soon it was the 22nd. All night we waited and nothing happened. We had nothing. My dad thrashed everything and none of the bills were paid and neither of us had jobs (I was unable to work due to my dad keeping a tight hold on me and he was in between jobs). I didn't know what to think but the deafening silence was broken by my dad tackling me to the ground and violently bludgeoning me. All he was saying was ""this is your fault!"" and ""jesus was supposed to reward me!"". I had to knee him in the stomach to get him off and I ran as fast as I could to the nearest house (We were living in California at the time in a very wide spread stretch of desert so the nearest house was quite far.) I don't remember much of what happened after this (likely due to head trauma) but what I do recall is my vision going blurry and waking up in the back of a squad car as my dad was being held down by 2 police officers. I had no immediate (or any really) family so was placed in foster care and that brings us to today...26 and living alone in Nebraska with nothing. I suffered permeant brain damage and now am unable to even speak properly or see clearly let alone hold down a job. My anxiety has only worsened and now...I don't know what happened to my faith. I tried turning to the church for help but I was shunned. Told I deserved it and that God was testing me. To be told my suffering was deserved cut deep... I just wanted this out. Thank you to anyone who listened.
