jarins,0.0,6840.0,"Hello, Ethereum world!

Reddit admin [u/jarins](https://www.reddit.com/u/jarins/) here, with some exciting news to share today: Reddit has teamed up with the Ethereum Foundation to establish Reddit’s first-ever blockchain partnership!

As Reddit continues to grow with more than 50 million daily users and hundreds of thousands of communities, the platform has long maintained a decentralized ethos by empowering users to create, govern, and grow their own communities. Through this partnership, we will be increasing our commitment to blockchain, accelerating scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem, and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to millions of redditors.

In many ways, this collaboration started with the [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) that we hosted in this community with the Ethereum Foundation. In this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing Ethereum to Reddit-scale production. Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like Community Points on Ethereum. The scaling technology developed through this partnership will be open-sourced and publicly available for anyone to use.

We introduced [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Built on Ethereum, Community Points represent a user’s ownership in a community and rewards them for their individual contributions (such as posts and comments). This project is our first attempt at utilizing decentralized technology to empower individuals to have a sense of accountability and more ownership in the communities that they create and contribute to. Community Points are currently in beta on the Rinkeby network and are being tested in [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) and [r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/).

Our blockchain efforts will be led by Reddit's Crypto team (hi!). We are currently [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2413930) great backend engineers who want to build the decentralized Internet. If you’re interested in solving tough problems like scaling and bringing blockchain to millions of users, send me a PM or apply directly on Reddit’s careers page -- we’d love to talk to you!

We’re looking forward to working closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and contributing more to the broader Ethereum ecosystem -- and we hope to share some exciting announcements over the next few months. I'll be hanging around with a couple of folks from the Ethereum Foundation to answer questions. Ask away!",ethereum,Reddit announces partnership with the Ethereum Foundation,6840.0,0.96

But to me, this whole cluster f*ck with Robinhood and $GME has blatantly exposed 2 problems with the traditional finance system that Ethereum solves. I understand there are different narratives as to what is happening with Robinhood so I will address both narratives because Ethereum solves them both.

Narrative 1: Robinhood/brokerages banned buying to make $GME crash to protect the hedge funds.

Solution: Ethereum solves this with decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. Something as absurd as banning buying could never happen on a DEX.

Narrative 2: Robinhood/brokerages temporarily suspended buying because the clearing firms raised their requirement for reserves to 100% for the shares of $GME during settlement (takes 2-3 days)

Solution: Ethereum solves this by settling transactions in minutes, not days.

We need to be pushing harder on marketing this.

Freedom-Phoenix,0.0,1432.0,"The recent post titled [*Binance, a centralized exchange, is taking total advantage of the absurdly high gas fees. And unfortunately they’re doing a damn good job of it.*](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loy1qe/binance_a_centralized_exchange_is_taking_total/) got me thinking. Most people including me until recenty have been thinking that the high fees on ETH are crazy uncomfortable right now but it doesn't matter long term as it's being worked on and therefore temporary, it's just a ""pause"" in its utility and all the good times will just resume once it's solved by L2, sharding or POS.

The surge in BNB value is a wake up call, as the OP in the linked thread put it:

&gt; I hate that they are completely CENTRALISED but make themselves seem decentralized. They have complete control over the BNB token. **This is exactly what the crypto community feared and wanted to avoid all along.**

That's exactly right, that's what we feared and should have feared much more as it gets more real every day. Especially because as another poster put it:

&gt; The open market doesn't give a shit about decentralization. If you don't agree, you're actually in the minority. That's why pancakeswap rocketed to #1. That's why Tether is used to this extent. That's why XRP is top 10. That's why exchanges control over 40% of ETH staking.

That quote is frightening, it's frightening because it's true. Majority of people in general, be it traders, devs or users do not care about decentralization. And the more people from general population join the crypto space, the more it becomes the reality for that space.

**That's where lies the very real danger for ETH of, not being attacked from within, but being REPLACED and OVERTAKEN by centralized pseudo-coins and once this happens it might stay that way forever given the above!**

Up until now many thought that ETH is far too ahead to be challenged and we can afford a year or two until scaling solutions are deployed, but **BNB showed otherwise, it got 500% closer in *two weeks*, we *do not have* 2 years to solve this! They repeat this feat just ONCE and ETH is no longer the largest smart contract chain in crypto.**

The fee issue needs to be taken seriously if we want to protect ETH, it's a very real security risk, far bigger at this point than 51% attack, or state growth, uncle rate etc. HALF of Top 10 coins are centralized pseudo-coins, the threat is real not only for ETH but all truly decentralized cryptos. So let's not underestimate it.

We're bleeding developers, users, future innovation right now. I've seen multiple posts and comments about people abandoning ETH leaving for another chain because of the fees. **Once they have this bad experience and invested time and money in another chain, they're not coming back. This is ""invisible"" at first, that guy who left is going to have his project completed and mature in 3-5 years but it will be too late then when we start to see it more openly, it's no stopping it then.**

Also when centralized projects close in or overtake ETH even for a while that's when they're going to take full advantage of their centralized nature. **They're going to be making big bucks which are going to go toward troll farms, media, ""influencers"", armies of paid devs and big institutions are going to buy in as they just LOVE centralization. It's also going to be too late once this becomes apparent.** We might end up rambling about it in an obscure corner of the internet, be ETH fanbois that nobody cares or even knows about - it might seem unimaginable now but once this train gets rolling it might end up exactly like that 5-10 years from now, crypto moves at lightspeed.

If you're thinking that rollups will solve this, think again, L2 is complex and suitable only for a very narrow set of use cases, look at LN on BTC, it totally flopped. Crypto is complex enough, L2 is a level above that and it takes years to make the UX good enough. L2 on ETH breaks composability or makes it complex to the power of 2. **Are we willing to gamble the future of ETH on the hope that L2 gets adopted quickly enough contrary to all experience until now? That carrot has been dangled with SegWit/LN on BTC for years now, let's please not make the same mistake.**

So what am I proposing? As a first step we need to alleviate the pressure *right now*, that can be done ONLY by raising the block gas limit substantially ASAP, at least double it, ideally quadruple it. We've had time for L2, other scaling solutions a year ago, but that ship has sailed, there is no more time.

If you're thinking about the drawbacks of raising the limit, think it in a context of a real threat to ETH security - would it be worth it if there was an imminent threat of a 51% attack? Would it be worth to raise the limit to prevent the attack then? Because that's the situation we're in, just more insidious as the damage caused today is going to show itself only in a few years when there is no longer anything we can do about it.

But I do not think there are any real showstoppers here, uncle rate is at ATL, storage and state growth doesn't matter if we can handle it now as in a few years it will become orders of magnitude easier to handle, for the comuters in 5-10 years it will be just a immaterial blip.

This will buy us time to develop L2 and rollups, which in turn buys us time for sharding and POS but we NEED to kick the can down the road right now as to stop the bleeding.

**Anyway, if you take anything from this write up, even if you disagree with some suggestions, it's that high fees ARE A SERIOUS SECURITY RISK on par with a 51% attack. And it should be taken just as seriously, by the devs and by the users. Beware and be suspicious of people minimizing that risk (in a reasonable way ofc), troll farms may soon be in full swing and the likes of BNB would like nothing more than for us to underestimate this threat.**",ethereum,"The biggest security threat to Ethereum is not a 51% attack, it's getting replaced by centralized pseudo-cryptocurrency",1432.0,0.94

# The Goal

In conjunction with the Ethereum Foundation, Reddit is inviting Ethereum scaling projects to show the community how your scaling solution can be used to bring [Community Points](http://reddit.com/community-points) to mainnet. Our goal is to find a solution that will support hundreds of thousands of Community Points users on mainnet today, and can eventually scale to all of Reddit (430 million monthly users).

We’ve evaluated some of the most promising scaling solutions, and have learned a few things:

1. There are plenty of awesome projects that we don't know about yet. We seem to learn about a promising new scaling solution every day.
2. Most existing scaling solutions focus on the exchange use case, which favors optimizing for transfers. Many of these designs don't take into consideration the costs of obtaining tokens or entering the scaling system, which can be significant. Community Points distributions have cost an order of magnitude more gas than all other operations combined, primarily due to on-chain storage costs associated with onboarding new users.
3. It's unclear how to determine the best solution. There is a lot of code, a lot of documentation, and a lot of hype out there. But there are very few objective real-world reviews or comparisons of various products/implementations.
4. We need the Ethereum community's help to figure this out.

Do you have a scaling project that meets the criteria below? If so, share your demo by **July 31, 2020.** Please note that all demos need to simulate Community Points usage for 100,000 users.

We also invite all scaling experts in the Ethereum community to comment on any demos submitted to enable a better understanding of the trade-offs and compromises between different solutions.

We will review the demos and plan to share any updates by September. While we don’t expect any novel scaling projects, we hope that you, the Ethereum scaling expert, can show us how to scale Community Points.

**Demos should include:**

1. A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions
2. Source code (for on &amp; off-chain components as well tooling used for the PoC). The source code does not have to be shared publicly, but if Reddit decides to use a particular solution it will need to be shared with Reddit at some point
3. Documentation
   1. How it works &amp; scales
   2. Cost estimates (on-chain and off-chain)
   3. How to run it
   4. Architecture
   5. APIs (on chain &amp; off)
   6. Known issues or tradeoffs
4. Summary of cost &amp; resource information for both on-chain &amp; off-chain components used in the PoC, as well as cost &amp; resource estimates for further scaling. If your PoC is not on mainnet, make note of any mainnet caveats (such as congestion issues).

# Requirements

**Scaling.** This PoC should scale to the numbers below with minimal costs (both on &amp; off-chain). There should also be a clear path to supporting hundreds of millions of users.

* Over a 5 day period, your scaling PoC should be able to handle:
   * 100,000 point claims (minting &amp; distributing points)
   * 25,000 subscriptions
   * 75,000 one-off points burning
   * 100,000 transfers

**Decentralization.** Solutions should not depend on any single third-party provider.

* We prefer solutions that do not depend on specific entities such as Reddit or another provider, and solutions with no single point of control or failure in off-chain components, but recognize there are numerous trade-offs to consider

**Usability.** Scaling solutions should have a simple end user experience.

* Users shouldn't have to maintain any extra state/proofs, regularly monitor activity, keep track of extra keys, or sign anything other than their normal transactions
* Transactions complete in a reasonable amount of time (seconds or minutes, not hours or days)
* Free to use for end users (no gas fees, or fixed/minimal fees that Reddit can pay on their behalf)
* Bonus points:
   * Users should be able to view their balances &amp; transactions via a blockchain explorer-style interface
   * Exiting is fast &amp; simple

**Interoperability.** Compatibility with third party apps (wallets/contracts/etc) is necessary.

* Scaling solutions should be extensible and allow third parties to build on top of it
* APIs should be well documented and stable
* Documentation should be clear and complete
* Third-party permissionless integrations should be possible &amp; straightforward
* Simple is better. Learning an uncommon or proprietary language should not be necessary. Advanced knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, or L2 scaling should not be required. Compatibility with common utilities &amp; toolchains is expected.
* Bonus Points: Show us how it works. Do you have an idea for a cool new use case for Community Points? Build it!

**Security.** Users have full ownership &amp; control of their points.

* Balances and transactions cannot be forged, manipulated, or blocked by Reddit or anyone else
* Users should own their points and be able to get on-chain ERC20 tokens without permission from anyone else
* Points should be recoverable to on-chain ERC20 tokens even if all third-parties involved go offline
* A public, third-party review attesting to the soundness of the design should be available
* Bonus points:
   * Public, third-party implementation review available or in progress
   * Compatibility with HSMs &amp; hardware wallets

**Other Considerations**

* Minting/distributing tokens is not performed by Reddit directly \[1\]
* One off point burning, as well as recurring, non-interactive point burning (for subreddit memberships \[2\]) should be possible and scalable
* Fully open-source solutions are strongly preferred

\[1\] In the current implementation, Reddit provides signed data for claims, but does not submit the actual claim transaction for the user (the user does that themselves). Note that smart contracts are considered independent of Reddit provided there is a path to decentralizing control over them.

\[2\] Subreddit memberships are currently implemented as a contract acting as an ERC777-style operator that can burn points on a monthly basis, but we are open to changing that implementation.

# Community Points Overview

To help you get started, this is an overview of how [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) work today and some stats on how it's used. We are open to changing most implementation details, provided the basic requirements (above) are met.

## Usage stats over the past month

Number of Community Points holders: \~17,500

Number of transfers: \~20,000

(reference: reddit.dappradar.com)

Number of subreddit memberships: \~800

## Contracts

Community Points is built around 3 contracts:

1. SubredditPoints: the ERC20 token
2. Distributions: manages token supply &amp; token claims
3. Subscriptions: enables membership subscriptions in the form of recurring token burn

## Deployed Contracts &amp; Source Code

## Points Distribution &amp; Claims

Token supply is controlled by distribution rounds managed in the Distributions contract and triggered by Reddit. For each round (occurring \~monthly), Reddit submits a proposal for points distribution to a subreddit for approval. Once approved, Reddit issues signed claims for individual users according to the agreed upon points distribution. These claims can be redeemed on-chain. Claims are obtained from Reddit, and submitted to the Distributions contract, which validates the claim and calls the Subreddit Points contract to mint points.

## Memberships

Subreddit memberships are obtained by burning points via the Subscriptions contract. Redditors can optionally configure their membership to be renewable on a monthly basis without additional interaction. The Subscriptions contract is granted permission to burn points by being configured as an ERC777-style default operator in the Subreddit Points contract.

EIP 1559 is a proposal to reform the Ethereum fee market, with the following key changes:

* The current gas limit of 10 million is replaced by two values: a &amp;#34;long-term average target&amp;#34; (10 million), and a &amp;#34;hard per-block cap&amp;#34; (20 million)
* There is a BASEFEE (which is burned) which transactions are required to pay, which gets adjusted on a block-by-block basis with the goal of targeting a value so that average block gas usage remains around 10 million.

Essentially, instead of all of the short-term volatility in demand for transaction space within a block translating into volatility in transaction fees, some of the volatility instead translates into volatility in block size.

## Why is EIP 1559 good?

Copying from [an older post](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3473):

-----------------------

There are three major problems with the status quo of transaction fee markets:

* **Mismatch between volatility of transaction fee levels and social cost of transactions**: transaction fees on mature public blockchains, that have enough usage so that blocks are full, tend to be extremely volatile. On Ethereum, minimum fees are typically around 2 gwei (10^9 gwei = 1 ETH), but sometimes go up to 20-50 gwei and have even on one occasion gone up to over 200 gwei: https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice. This clearly creates many inefficiencies, because it&amp;#39;s absurd to suggest that the cost incurred by the network from accepting one more transaction into a block actually is 100x more when gas prices are 200 gwei than when they are 2 gwei; in both cases, it&amp;#39;s a difference between 8 million gas and 8.02 million gas.
* **Inefficiencies of first price auctions**: see https://ethresear.ch/t/first-and-second-price-auctions-and-improved-transaction-fee-markets/2410 for a detailed writeup. In short, the current approach, where transaction senders publish a transaction with a fee, miners choose the highest-paying transactions, and everyone pays what they bid, is well-known in mechanism design literature to be highly inefficient, and so complex fee estimation algorithms are required, and even these algorithms often end up not working very well, leading to frequent fee overpayment. See also https://blog.bitgo.com/the-challenges-of-bitcoin-transaction-fee-estimation-e47a64a61c72 for a Bitcoin core developer&amp;#39;s description of the challenges involved in fee estimation in the status quo.
* **Instability of blockchains with no block reward**: in the long run, blockchains where there is no issuance (including Bitcoin and Zcash) at present intend to switch to rewarding miners entirely through transaction fees. However, there are [known results](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf) showing that this likely leads to a lot of instability, incentivizing mining &amp;#34;sister blocks&amp;#34; that steal transaction fees, opening up much stronger selfish mining attack vectors, and more. There is at present no good mitigation for this.

EIP 1559 has these benefits:

* It mitigates the economic inefficiencies from social cost mismatch due to fee volatility. There is a fairly nuanced economic argument here; see particularly pages 16-20 of the paper linked in https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838 (though I recommend reading the whole paper) for a detailed argument of why this is the case. Intuitively, the adjusting fee mechanism works like a fixed fee in the short run and a cap in the long run, and it turns out that because of [arguments from Martin Weitzman&amp;#39;s 1974 paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf) fixed fees are likely better than a cap in the circumstances that basically all public blockchains are in today and will likely continue to be in.
* It replaces the auction with a fixed price sale (except during short periods where blocks fill up completely until fees catch up), eliminating first-price-auction inefficiencies and making fee estimation extremely simple: calculate the fee `f` for the next block, if you can afford it pay it, otherwise don&amp;#39;t.
* It creates a mechanism similar to a permanent block reward (the 1/N coming from the pot), mitigating many of the instability issues with fee-only blockchains without requiring actual permanent issuance.

-----------------------

Another underrated benefit of EIP 1559 is that it makes gas prices _securely measurable_. Today, just looking at gas prices on chain and using them as an index is exploitable, because miners could include either very-low-fee or very-high-fee dummy transactions where the fee would go to themselves. But under EIP 1559, the BASEFEE can only be manipulated at high cost, as dummy transactions would requre even the miner to pay fees (that get burned).

## Are current fee markets really that inefficient?

Yes. The difference between average gasprice and 10th percentile gasprice in a regular block is something like 3x for median and 5-8x for mean. People needlessly overpay massively.

Everyone who does not overpay suffers a delay of 1-2 minutes or even longer, and this delay does not actually benefit anyone; the total load to the chain is the same regardless of whether a given unit of load hits the chain at time N or time N + 60. **There is no actual social benefit from participants &amp;#34;expressing a low time preference&amp;#34;** in the fee market mechanism, at least under normal conditions; it is pure deadweight loss. We would all be better off if more transactions were just included immediately, which EIP 1559 allows.

## Why not just use a second price(or kth price auction) to solve the first-price-auction inefficiencies?

Kth-price auctions (where everyone pays a gasprice equal to the lowest gasprice that was included in the block) are indeed &amp;#34;efficient&amp;#34; in a traditional economic analysis*, but have the flaw that they are vulnerable to collusion.

* Yes of course technically you want to use the _highest gasprice not included_ in the block; but in practice given that most ethereum blocks have hundreds of transactions the difference would be negligible.

## Might EIP 1559 run the risk of over-stressing nodes and miners during periods of high usage?

EIP 1559 can at most increase block size by 2x, even in the short term. Each &amp;#34;full block&amp;#34; (ie. a block whose gas is 2x the TARGET) increases the BASEFEE by 1.125x, so a series of constant full blocks will increase the gas price by a factor of 10 every ~20 blocks (~4.3 min on average). Hence, periods of heavy on-chain load will not realistically last longer than ~5 minutes.

Note that currently, periods of double load that last 5 minutes already happen by random chance roughly once per ~63888 blocks (~10 days) because of variance in the rate of block production. So the introduction of EIP 1559 would not bring in any unprecedented level of load to the system.

Additionally, the gas limit being only 10 million and not higher is justified to a large extent not by hard network limits (uncle rates are [near historic lows](https://etherscan.io/chart/uncles), though risks to non-miner nodes such as bootstrap nodes, may be higher), but by concerns that are fundamentally long-term in character:

* Centralization risk of somewhat higher uncle rates: if uncle rates shoot up to 20%, that would disproportionately benefit well-connected large pools
* Limits to state size
* Difficulty of syncing after a short period offline

In all three of these cases, what matters is not the upper bound on capacity within a very short window of time, but rather the long-term average capacity. Uncle rates being 2% during odd hours and 18% during even hours would have the same effect on all three of the above, as uncle rates always being 10%. Because EIP 1559 still bounds the long-run gas usage to a ~10 million per block average, it does not affect the long-term average.

## How would a spike of high usage look like under EIP 1559 compared to the status quo?

Consider a &amp;#34;mathematically ideal spike&amp;#34; (eg. this could happen in real life because of a sudden market event leading to many arbitrage opportunities on DEXes, bidding on liquidated CDPs, etc), where N * 10 million gas worth of transactions, each with a very very high gasprice, are all broadcasted.

Currently, this would lead to the following situation:

* The next N blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions
* After that other transactions, as well as transactions that people send after the spike, get included in descending order of gasprice

An average &amp;#34;normal user&amp;#34; would have to wait more than N blocks.

Now, consider the situation under EIP 1559:

* The next N/2 blocks are filled exclusively with new spiky transactions, each with twice the normal amount of gas
* If all other transactions get sent with a gas price cap equal to the old gasprice, then the next N/2 blocks would be empty, and after that things would revert to normal. But realistically, higher-priority transactions would set higher gas price caps and get included first, and other transactions later.

An average &amp;#34;normal user&amp;#34; would have to wait somewhere between N/2 and more than N blocks.

Hence, even including the post-spike &amp;#34;recovery period&amp;#34; during which block capacity would be smaller than normal, most transactions get included sooner.

Here&amp;#39;s a very rough simulation (there are lots of strange assumptions here, but modeling a full system that covers both supply/demand curves *and* waiting times is hard); spreadsheet source [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iid0PnO5UTMECW2RylVwEOECFbW5iWsJSHmP4zj7Lr4/edit?usp=sharing).

## What would EIP 1559 do under larger and more prolonged spikes (eg. day-long spikes)

Not much. The BASEFEE would rise and there would be a short period at the beginning where a few transactions get in faster, but after that the fee market would function just as it would under &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; conditions, just at a higher fee level. The main benefit of EIP 1559 in spikes is that the harms from inefficiency of regular fee markets are magnified when fees are high, so having a functioning fee market becomes more important.

## If the chain _can_ handle 2x block size spikes, doesn&amp;#39;t that mean the chain can handle just making _all_ blocks 2x larger?

No. See this post for why:

https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip_1559_spikes

## Why limit = target * 2? Why not 4? Or 8?

It could easily be higher than 2. The higher the limit/target ratio the greater the fee market efficiency benefits of EIP 1559. It depends on how  severe the short term spikes are that we are willing to accept; 2x is fairly conservative. We could even launch EIP 1559 with a limit/target of 2 to start off, and increase it over time as we see the network functioning okay even under short-term spikes.

## Why would miners include transactions at all?

The EIP includes a &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; that transaction senders can include, that goes to the miner. The tip has two functions: first, if there are suddenly far more transactions than expected, miners will include transactions with higher tips first, so the fee-based prioritization mechanism exists as a backup. Second, it compensates miners for uncle risk (the increased risk their block will not be included in the main chain because adding one more transaction will slow it down).

The tip level that compensates for uncle risk has been calculated to be about 0.8 gwei (uncle blocks get on average a 1.67 ETH reward instead of the 2 ETH base, so that&amp;#39;s a ~0.33 ETH = 330m gwei loss, 10 million gas blocks add ~0.025 to the uncle rate ckompared to empty blocks, so the expected cost of 1 gas is = 330m / 10m * 0.025 = 0.825 gwei) and miners do actually set about this value when the chain is empty.

This tip level is independent of the BASEFEE, so client implementations can confidently set 1-1.5 gwei and expect their transactions to be accepted.

## How might wallets choose tips? Is there a risk of bidding wars for tips?

Wallets could simply choose tips by looking at what tips have been accepted on chain historically, and increasing their tip if they see that a transaction they send was not accepted immediately. Note that in &amp;#34;normal conditions&amp;#34; there is no incentive to set a tip higher than the bare minimum.

In cases of sudden congestion, tips _do_ degrade into a bidding war; wallets can detect congestion, and in this case they could offer users the option of setting low or high priority for their transaction.

## What is the escalator mechanism? How might the escalator mechanism be combined with EIP 1559?

The escalator mechanism is a different proposed transaction fee reform, where instead of specifying a single fee, users specify their fee as a function, usually with a beginning, an increase-per-block and a maximum, for example &amp;#34;5 gwei if this transaction is included in block 10123456, add 1 gwei for every block after that (eg. 8 gwei if included in block 10123459), up to a maximum of 100 gwei&amp;#34;.

This would be four parameters: beginning fee, beginning block, per-block increment, max fee.

The goal is to be &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; against mistakes in fee estimation, as if the fee turns out to be too low it would naturally rise over time until the transaction is included. In an EIP 1559 context, this could be used to set the tip. The fact that the tip would generally be in a constant range means that even a wallet using fixed parameters for the escalator would deliver reasonably good outcomes to users.

## Won&amp;#39;t miners have the incentive to collude to push down the BASEFEE by making all their blocks less than half full?

In general, the effectiveness of such strategies is limited, because unless truly almost everyone colludes, a transaction not included in one block will get included will just get included in the next block and so the effect of this action on the long-run BASEFEE will be negligible.

However, what miners _can_ do is a kind of &amp;#34;monopoly pricing&amp;#34;. Suppose transaction senders are willing to pay some extra fee to avoid getting delayed one block. Miners can refuse to include transactions that do not include some minimum tip `T`; they lose out on some fee revenue, but gain from senders increasing their fees if they value the extra probability you will be the next miner and include their transaction highly enough. This strategy is heavily tilted against the miner: they suffer the full cost of lost fee revenue, but gain only a small portion of the increased transaction fees that others send.

Note that even if a miner using such a strategy is successful, they will increase other miners&amp;#39; revenue more than it will increase their own revenue (as other miners free-ride on the higher tips due to your actions), so it is not a centralization vector.

This will _not_ reduce BASEFEEs down to zero; rather, it will hit an equilibrium where BASEFEEs remain the bulk of the fee and tips take up the remainder. This is because unless miners are all colluding (in which case we have bigger problems), miners suffer the entire cost of not including transactions but gain only some of the benefit of tips being higher.

**If the risk of miners deploying such a strategy is _still_ deemed unacceptably high, we can direct some (eg. 50%) of the revenue from EIP 1559 into a pool from which a small percentage is drained every block to be added to the miners&amp;#39; block reward**; this ensures miners benefit from the BASEFEE being high, further reducing the gains from such an attack.

Here is a proposed sketch of a change to the EIP to do this:

* Define the account 0x35 as `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`, and define `FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT = 8192`
* Add an additional term to the block reward (added at the same time as the base block reward and uncle+nephew rewards). Let `smoothing_reward = FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER.balance // FEE_SMOOTHING_CONSTANT`. Transfer `smoothing_reward` wei from `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER` to `block.coinbase`
* After applying the block rewards, 1/2 of EIP-1559 fees from that block (rounding down) get added to `FEE_SMOOTHING_BUFFER`&amp;#39;s balance. The remainder (ie. 1/2 rounding up) gets burned.

Note that in a proof of stake context, it would be desirable to implement secret leader elections along with penalties for early revelation, to prevent validators from acquiring reputations as only accepting high tips and gaining the entire benefit of this themselves as transaction senders would know which validators are creating blocks soon.

I've learned a lesson today: DO YOUR RESEARCH! I naively transact my coins to a company that's not very trustworthy which I wasn't aware of before. A quick google search could've helped me a lot.

I've learned my mistake and never make the same again! You live and you learn.

I haven't got a reply yet from the support team or didn't got a refund yet.

I'll update this post when things change. Thank you!

**UPDATE: 0/1/17/2021**

I finally got my money back! It took a week to get it back. But, I'm glad I haven't lost it.

My 12 ETH  swap to 0.4125 BTC.

This is first ticket which they did not reply back:

&amp;#x200B;

I made another ticket because they did not reply to the first one. One member from the support team finally replied back. It them a week to respond. Not acceptable.

This is the most recent ticket and they're response:

In the end, the order passed and got my BTC into my wallet. I rather have a refund and get my 12 ETH instead of BTC, but that's okay.

**I still do NOT recommend anyone to use CoinSwitch. They're customer service is terrible and there's a high risk of losing your coins and money.**

Thank you r/ethereum community.

D_Center,0.0,675.0,"Hello redditors,

We’ve just published a new article dedicated to Ethereum on D.Center – I paste it here hoping it could be useful to beginners interested in the asset, and maybe even to some crypto amateurs who could discover new things 😊

***The blockchain aiming at “decentralizing everything”, Ethereum brings its benefits to numerous domains by enabling complex smart contracts and Dapps.***

Diverse use cases and the absence of an easily customizable blockchain helped formulate a need for a multi-purpose blockchain, on which a wide array of applications could be built. The first to come with a solution was a Russian-Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin, who submitted the Ethereum concept to the crypto community in late 2013. After a successful crowdfunding in 2014 the platform went live by July 2015.

The major innovation of Ethereum that distinguished it from Bitcoin was a wide range of possible **smart contracts** that could be coded on its blockchain. A smart contract is basically a computer program registered on a blockchain that is executed by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) when a transaction is sent to its address; the results of a program execution are themselves being stored on a blockchain. The **DApps** (decentralized applications) using these smart contracts enjoy all security and independence benefits of a blockchain: program execution is entrusted to a decentralized network instead of a single third party.

## Ethereum consensus and fees

In order to incentivize Ethereum nodes to run smart contracts, fees are paid for every transaction. **These fees are paid in a special unit called gas and depend on the amount of computations to be done**. Gas can be bought with Ethereum native currency Ether (ETH), the price being decided by the market according to the supply/demand ratio. 

Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Work consensus, like Bitcoin, although it has some specificities of its own: hashing function is Ethash and a block is added every 15 seconds. Ethers are generated as a miner’s reward for adding a block, however there’s no hard cap on their total emission. Current yearly network issuance is approximately 4.5%, and will be reduced with ETH 2.0

## Ethereum tokens

Ethereum is also a very convenient platform for the creation of tokens - digital units circulating on a blockchain and representing a certain value assigned to them by their creator. Its **ERC20** (fungible) and **ERC721** (non-fungible) tokens have become the standards in the industry and are being used extensively.

## DAO

Ethereum can be used to build Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). A **DAO is an organization with governance defined by smart contracts registered on a blockchain**. A DAO allows a group of persons to interact using an open source protocol with auto-executing qualities; this protocol and the associated smart contracts formalize the organisation’s operation rules. Once deployed, a DAO is independent from its creator and isn’t controlled by an entity, but rather by a consensus between its participants, according to its blockchain-registered code. The owners of tokens associated with a DAO are assigned voting rights and are often rewarded for their participation in the DAO’s governance.

The transparency and immutability of the blockchain make such organizations difficult to corrupt, proposing an alternative model to centralized organizations. There are lots of DAO in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance), the most famous being Maker DAO - a lending platform managing the dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI.

## ETH 2.0 and Casper 

Ethereum relying on a PoW consensus, it has its standard disadvantages: the blockchain is rather slow, costly and energy consuming. To overcome these drawbacks an important update has been planned since Ethereum conception: initially called Serenity and now mostly referred to as **ETH 2.0**, this update has been released in December 2020. It has been deployed on a parallel chain first, in order to conduct all the necessary tests before becoming the main Ethereum chain.

ETH 2.0 relies on a consensus called **Casper**, which is a version of the PoS consensus: validator nodes stake a minimum amount of 32 ETH to be able to propose a block or to validate it. The new consensus would also improve the blockchain’s scalability, allowing a blocktime of just a couple of seconds.

ETH 2.0 will also affect the annual Ether emission rate, which will be significantly decreased, or even become negative.

## Ethereum today

Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for DApps development, with over 5000 DApps built on it. It is a major blockchain for the Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, with an important new metrics - TVL (Total Value Locked), representing the collateral locked in different types of DeFi applications - exceeding $50 BN worth of crypotoassets. 

ETH 2.0 is a major ambition for Vitalik Buterin. According to the Ethereum creator, the 4 major problems that need to be solved to push Ethereum to the next level are privacy, consensus safety, smart contract safety, and  scalability. Some would add a governance issue to the list, for its role in blockchain’s life is crucial.

[OMG Network and the Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off](https://preview.redd.it/pld4qb1yp7e51.png?width=2240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff44cb6ec1d978562d4353a67b97118404adc4af)

Late last month, Reddit announced The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off, an open-invitation competition calling all Ethereum scaling projects to show the community a scaling solution that can be used to bring Community Points to mainnet.

Once we decided to take up the challenge we had one goal in mind: to build a live and scalable application that our 43K strong Reddit community\* can use to transfer ROCKs (community points) on our subreddit in real-time — all while fulfilling the technical requirements laid out by the Reddit team.

It took us less than 30 days to achieve our goal.

# Introducing the Community Points Engine by OMG Network

The [Community Points Engine (CPE) powered by OMG Network](https://omg.network/reddit-bakeoff-scaling-community-points/) is a Chrome Extension that allows for fee-less and near-real-time value transfer while browsing the OMG Network subreddit. Users can transfer points without entering the receiver’s wallet address; the extension automatically extracts it for you, making transfers fluid and easy.

&amp;#x200B;

[Introducing the OMG Community Points Engine](https://reddit.com/link/i19us9/video/1a0w2vqkm7e51/player)

But the CPE is not only built with the subreddit subscriber in mind, the tool serves all types of Reddit users. So if you’re a moderator, you can immediately mint and distribute points to anybody on the subreddit, as well as burn points and handle all admin actions with a user-friendly dashboard. If you’re a Reddit team member, you can rest assured knowing that the OMG Network can withstand the traffic threshold that Reddit requires thanks to our MoreViable Plasma Technology.

It’s no secret that designing for simplicity is hard, but simple is desirable, and that’s why it was our priority with this application. Because while we understand and appreciate the value of trustlessness in technology, the concept, and the feature is inherently complicated. We want the CPE to be something everyone can use, and will only highlight ‘technical’ elements when necessary.

# Checking All The Boxes

[Community point claims, transfers and brrrrns](https://preview.redd.it/ogh6owlws7e51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a823b1d1ceb12d328f8109b0e7d6434874733bf)

* **Usable:** The Community Point interface allows users to make fee-less transactions just like they would through a regular app. The integration is seamlessly built into the current subreddit browsing experience.
* **Scalable:** OMG Network’s MoreViable Plasma design is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. The new fee-relayer design also allows point providers to manage funds and settle multiple fee-less transactions at the same time.
* **Interoperable:** Never build products in a vacuum. The solution is fully compatible with existing wallets such as Metamask. In fact, interoperability is so important to us that we’ve integrated a third-party provider — [CurveGrid’s MultiBaaS](https://docs.omg.network/3rd-party/multibaas) — as part of the solution itself.
* **Secure:** We take software security seriously. The underlying network is trustless and non-custodial. This means users have full ownership over their points even if the network faces issues. Our solution also takes advantage of secure key management standards like Hardware Security Module.
* **Decentralized:** No need to trust the operator, our Watcher software and Plasma protocol ensure nobody has to put their trust on one central point of failure

# A Few Words on What We Care About

The blockchain ecosystem is well on its way to mainstream adoption and large-scale applications like Reddit are beginning to look at trustless technology to solve real problems. The time for experimentation and theoretical design is over; it’s time for production-ready software to take center stage.

We standby what we’ve accomplished in the past 30 days and consider this challenge as a great way to showcase the OMG Network and our seriousness as a team. We approached the Great Reddit Bake-Off as we would any client project, leaving no stone unturned when it came to delivering a well- designed, well-documented, and well-developed solution.

The Bake-Off’s specs are descriptive, but we know that great software is much more than that. It is a collaboration between client and solution provider. We look forward to upcoming iterations and hope to discover and work towards Reddit’s real needs so that we can design the right type of infrastructure for their application.

Nonetheless, a competition like this goes to show how mature the Layer-2 space has become over the past few years. As we advance as a company, we’ll be sure to design, develop, and iterate on our product and look to see other projects grow from theoretical design to a complete product.

Finally, software is not done because we've met the deadline. There is always room for improvement. Over the next few days we will be inviting you all in to help us test the CPE Chrome Extension on our new subreddit: [r/omgnetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/omgnetwork).

##A new crypto user and their crypto are easily parted. 

Here are a few ways to prevent that:


###1. Get a hardware wallet. 🛡️
A hardware wallet holds your private key within the device and protects it from being exposed. It's recommended to use a hardware wallet for cold storage (the funds you don't plan to touch).
The two biggest players are [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/1985?path=/products/) and [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/?offer_id=10&amp;aff_id=1735). Both are great.


###2. Browse safely. 🌐
Always use bookmarks and never click links, and install an extension like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [EAL](https://harrydenley.com/ethaddresslookup-chrome-extension-release/) to protect you from known phishing sites.


###3. Never enter your private keys on a website. 🔑
One of the most common ways for someone to be parted from their cryptocurrency is via a phishing site, a.k.a. a fake version of a real site. Phishing sites will usually allow you to enter your private key so you can ""access"" your funds, but as soon as you enter your private key they'll send it to their servers, access your funds themselves, and drain your account.

[It's a BAD HABIT to enter your private key into a website](https://medium.com/mycrypto/private-keys-websites-aa85b42113a0). Just don't do it. If you have to use a private key / mnemonic phrase / keystore file, use a [desktop application](https://download.mycrypto.com/) that's away from the browser. Even then, make sure to [verify](https://support.mycrypto.com/staying-safe/verifying-authenticity-of-desktop-app) it's not a fake desktop application.


###4. Turn on 2FA for everything. EVERYTHING. 📲
 Choose Google Authenticator over Authy. Don't use your phone number. Then, make sure your phone number is NOT tied to your Google account (look in privacy settings). 

[SIM-swapping is real and common](https://medium.com/mycrypto/what-to-do-when-sim-swapping-happens-to-you-1367f296ef4d) and if your phone number is attached to any account recoveries, you could be in real trouble.


###5. Be mindful of where you store your keys. 🔐
Don't store your keys on cloud storage like Dropbox. Don't store your keys in your email. Ideally, don't store your keys on any device that's connected to the internet. All of these things can be accessed by bad actors if you're not careful.

Use a hardware wallet, and keep your backups safe on an [air-gapped device](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/air-gapped-computer/) or in a safe physical location.


###6. Verify everything. 🔎
Check the URLs of the websites you're on. 

Check the URLs of the social media accounts you're reading. 

Check the URLs of the GitHub repos you're exploring.

Never download anything from an unverified URL that someone sent you - go find the proper URL at the proper source.

Double- and triple-check everything, especially when you're sending a transaction - read and verify the output addresses. For an extra layer of assurance when sending a transaction, try out [Protected Transactions](https://support.mycrypto.com/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/what-are-protected-transactions).


###7. Never click on ads/promoted results. 🛑
Many times these promoted results are actually promoting scam/fake/phishing sites.


###8. Nobody is giving away ETH. 🚫
Ever.
EVER.
If you see someone giving away crypto or saying that you have to send them crypto to get more crypto in return, RUN AWAY. It's not real.


###9. Look out for one another. 💞
If you've been in this space for a while, you know exponentially more than someone who started exploring it. Things move quickly, so it's likely that you're an expert in some of these subjects, and you can share this knowledge to help new users build better habits.

You have the power to help others not screw up. Use that power!


###10. Use your brain. 🧠
Always stop and think. 

Don't assume, ask. 

Don't blindly follow, question. 

Patience is truly a virtue.

If something seems too good to be true, it's likely not true.

[Reddit's 5-day Challenge in 5 minutes on the Solana mainnet. No sharding, no Layer-2!](https://preview.redd.it/qu1pannx8vd51.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c09e4396ba361c9139f07230578f7b8360c2c4c)

Hey everyone, I’m Raj Gokal from the **Solana Foundation**. Solana tackled the Scaling Bake-Off this week and **completed the entire 5-day challenge in around 5 minutes for less than $5 USD.**

Here are the benchmarks of our challenge:

* Solana completed token minting in under 2 seconds across 64 threads;
* Solana completed 204,800 token transfers and point claims in 3 minutes, 20 seconds;
* Solana burned 75,520 tokens in 46 seconds;
* All while running on Solana’s mainnet across 130 geographically-distributed validators.

If you’re a geek, [you can run this demo for yourself on our mainnet](https://github.com/solana-labs/reddit-scaling-demo). You can even parallelize it on as many machines as you want and run it on mainnet. But if you just want to see it in action, I put together this video to show the entire challenge start to finish and to share a bit more about Solana.

&gt;**📺** Watch Solana complete [the 5-day challenge in 5 minutes, 42 seconds](https://youtu.be/ICXJoVGapSw).

&amp;#x200B;

# Play the “Break” Game

I invite you to experience the raw speed of Solana for yourself. In addition to the demo, we also built [an interactive demo called ""Break""](https://break.solana.com/) to illustrate Solana’s speed real time. It’s simple to play. Just smash keys on your keyboard. Each key sends a real transaction to the Solana mainnet. Every time a block changes color from black to green you know the transaction has been:

1. Sent from the client to the server
2. Forwarded from the server to the the block producer
3. Added to a block and propagated to the network
4. Voted on by everyone in the network
5. Approved by 2/3+ of votes, which is detected by the server
6. Sent back to the client, which gets the notification to turn the box green

Every blockchain claims to be fast, so it’s really hard to tell what’s real. A real-time game is the best demo we could come up with to prove to you how fast Solana really is. We’re also running a competition right now to encourage concurrent usage on the network.

Please make sure to post pictures of your broken keys/keyboards or high scores on r/solana. We’ll give out 1,000 SOLs to the 5 best pictures.

&gt;**Hit me up!** If you’re short on the SOL required to play, just reply in this thread with your Solana wallet address or with an imgur link to a screenshot with a QR code. Your first game is on us. (Not that it’s expensive to play anyways. See how long it takes you to burn 1 SOL on break).

# About the Network

**It’s Live on Mainnet**: Check out [this dashboard](https://solanabeach.io/) built by one of our awesome validators for network stats. So far, the network has grown larger and faster than any other network we’re aware of:

* 100 days since mainnet
* 25 million blocks
* 1.75 BILLION transactions

**It’s Cheap, and Fast as Hell:** This network was built for speed by people who used to optimize embedded systems and operating systems for a living. Smart contract transactions are so fast and cheap that we use them for consensus votes!

* $10 for 1 million transactions
* 400ms block times
* \~1.5s confirmation times

**It Only Gets Faster:** We are obsessively focused on horizontally scaling every part of a layer-1 blockchain without sharding. We will never be in a situation where the demand for the network grows so much that we can’t scale to meet it. Validators can always add more cores, more memory, more SSDs, more network bandwidth, on-demand, when the users need it.

**It’s Decentralized:** The network has seen a 300% growth of its validators since launch: In March, we launched mainnet with an elite group of 40 validators. To date, we’ve increased that group to over 130 validators actively securing the network. An additional 250 validators on testnet will soon be onboarded to mainnet.

**It’s Growing:** Since launch, we’ve also announced partnerships with [Kin](https://medium.com/kinblog/solana-migration-foundation-vote-a5803f698f54) (who are moving 3.5m users over from Stellar as we speak), [Serum](https://medium.com/solana-labs/ftx-chooses-solana-for-serum-a-high-speed-non-custodial-decentralized-derivatives-exchange-c346a27c1f2b) (a non-custodial CLOB derivatives exchange that [recently made headlines](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/72924/ftx-dex-serum-solana-blockchain)), [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), [Terra](https://www.coindesk.com/solana-blockchain-adds-korean-stablecoin-terra-for-better-payments), [Chainlink](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-and-chainlink-team-up-to-build-a-crazy-fast-oracle), [Civic](http://civic.com/), [Akash](https://akash.network/blog/akash-partners-with-solana-to-bring-web-scale-smart-contracts-to-supercloud/), [Fortmatic](https://fortmatic.com/), [Dfuse](https://www.dfuse.io/en/blog/dfuse-announces-a-partnership-with-solana-to-collaborate-on-a-powerful-data-solution-for-its-high-throughput-blockchain), [Hummingbot](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-05-solana-liquidity-mining-campaign-coming-soon/), and [more](https://medium.com/solana-labs).

# Scaling Ethereum

As part of helping projects use Solana interoperably with Ethereum, a bunch of people that helped build Solana are also already building super cool wraps and warps to make native Ethereum assets lightning fast using Solana. Two recent examples of this are our friends at [Terra](https://medium.com/terra-money/terra-partners-with-solana-to-establish-low-latency-bridge-expanding-its-stablecoin-ecosystem-to-15883bdbb0fb) and [FTX](https://medium.com/solana-labs/ftx-chooses-solana-for-serum-a-high-speed-non-custodial-decentralized-derivatives-exchange-c346a27c1f2b).

Solana is a Layer-1 blockchain and not positioned as a native Ethereum scaling solution per se. However, I believe we’re headed for a fully connected, multi-chain world where assets can and should easily bridge from one chain to another. Ethereum’s ecosystem is one-of-a-kind—our mission for this project is to help scale its value to global communities like Reddit.

I invite you to join our community to learn more. If you have any questions please leave them in the thread below and I’ll do my best to answer them asap. I’ll be answering questions alongside other members of our team and the community.

I just got scammed the way I never even thought is possible ( some of you might heard about this but I never heard until today).

Decided to cash some money out thru Coinbase, logged-in and copied BTC wallet address thru built-in Copy function as it shows on the screenshot below.

Logged in Binance to sent the BTC to Coinbase and just pasted the address from the buffer without second thought. Pushed the transaction. 1hour later I realized that its different address and only first 4 symbols are same. Somehow my copy-paste buffer changed the address from right one to wrong one.

Money lost. No way to recover it. Please dont repeat my mistake do not blindly trust to copy-paste buffer , your computer could be infected with malware that swaps addresses and it will be too late when you realize that.

P.S:

Since Coinbase not showing whole address and first 4 symbols were the same it was very easy to overlook

P.P.S:

heres the ""wrong address""  [https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/36cZUcWME52EF33Af8a6JCdm233jgmViXd](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/36cZUcWME52EF33Af8a6JCdm233jgmViXd)  you can verify with a screenshot that first 4 symbols are same and last 4 hidden.

Edit:

Please , I\`m not trying to say that this is someone else\`s fault ( I totally understand that its my fault and take ownership of it) .I shared this  experience for educational purposes, so newcomers or someone who never heard of such malware would not repeat same mistake. I\`m not getting anything from it, no need to tell me something that  I already know. It is my fault I agree and not blaming anything/anyone besides of myself.

[Minter Community's Open Letter to Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/030uhu6hxke51.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d37c840ffb8db0eb59907c4475bec654b9a96bbc)

Dea[r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/),

We were thrilled to find out Reddit was going to use distributed ledger technology for driving user engagement, interaction, and loyalty. The front page of the Internet switching to Web 3.0 is something you don’t see every day: fifteen years into existence, you’re once again on the cutting edge of innovation.

“There are plenty of awesome projects that we don’t know about yet,” reads the text you [put up](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff) recently. “Most existing scaling solutions focus on the exchange use case.” What we would like to offer here in this letter is an alternative: although Minter is separate from Ethereum, the project’s top priority is enabling brands — small, medium, and large alike — to implement blockchain-powered incentive and reward mechanisms into their operation.

**Every facet of our network is tailored to this very need:**

* The transaction is finalized in five seconds
* The fee never exceeds one cent
* The scalability is up to 180 million daily transactions
* Any community (*think of subreddits*) can issue their own coin in just 60 seconds, which can be then swapped not only for one another, but also for items such as iTunes gift cards, XBOX subscriptions, or any of the remaining 18,000 options — proving Minter provides a global solution aimed to achieve the goal you’ve set
* Easy-to-use, user-centric wallets are available across all platforms
* Our blockchain — as well as the vast majority of services built atop it — is [open-source](https://github.com/MinterTeam/minter-go-node), and the documentation is [detailed](https://docs.minter.network/)

**Demo**

100 transactions within 4.72 seconds - [this block in the mainnet](https://explorer.minter.network/transactions/Mt765f2472bb62297ee05e9c4afe28dd17e1aa271b14b6c04fc0d4efecdb939ad0)

    100*(60/4.72)*60*24 = 1 830 508 transactions / day

The price of 1.8ml transactions is 9244 BIP tokens or $75 with the current BIP price ([reference](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/minter-network/))

Point claims, transfers, point burning, subscriptions can be handled by blockchain utilizing transaction payload feature.

**Scaling**

Currently, the blockchain has an ability to proceed 10 000 transactions per block, it means that Minter is scalable up to 183 050 800 daily transactions, if necessary.

**Decentralization and Security**

In Minter, we implemented the Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) Consensus Protocol. Minter Blockchain utilizes:

    Tendermint Consensus Engine

dPoS is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. dPoS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way.

Minter blockchain now has 58 independent validators producing 1 block per 5 sec.

**Usability**

If Reddit would use Minter as their blockchain for Community points then all Redditors:

\- would not have problems with everyday coin operations, as Minter has well developed user-centric wallet apps for main platforms, iOS, Android, Web. Taste yourself!

* [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/bip-wallet/id1457843214)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.minter.bipwallet.mainnet)
* [Web](https://wallet.bip.to/)

\- would have their transactions processed within 5 seconds. Is it a reasonable amount of time? We think it is much more than that, it is pretty awesome.

\- would never pay more than one Cent per transaction.

\- would easily see the whole transaction history in the app or via blockchain export.

* [https://explorer.minter.network/](https://explorer.minter.network/)
* [https://minterscan.net/](https://minterscan.net/)

Issue *subreddit* coins in just 60 seconds, swap not only for one another, but also for items such as iTunes gift cards, XBOX subscriptions, or any of the remaining 18,000 options.

**Interoperability**

Minter team has developed a comprehensive toolset for third-party developers, which includes the [Console](https://console.minter.network/), [SDK](https://www.minter.network/docs#minter-sdks), and [API](https://www.minter.network/docs#other-public-services) for advanced integration. Our blockchain — as well as the vast majority of services built atop it — is [open-source](https://github.com/MinterTeam/minter-go-node).

**Some numbers**

* May 15, 2019 - mainnet launch
* 1,557 - active coins
* Over 9ml - transactions
* Over 7,6ml - blocks
* 4.63 - avg. seconds per block
* 58 - blockchain validators and growing
* Over 100 000 - BIP Wallet downloads

**Green light**

All we ask for is a green light to integrate any of the Reddit communities into our platform, seeing hundreds of millions of transactions in branded coins each and every day. One week is the time we need to make it work.

We would like to take this moment to thank the entire Reddit team for striving to make the Internet a better place. And if you are interested in the proposition we outlined above, please don’t hesitate to [contact](https://minter.org/korytov) Mikhail for further communication.

Also, please check our article: [Blockchain Reward System: Reddit Case Study](https://medium.com/@MinterTeam/blockchain-reward-system-99be560b3c42)

Best regards,

diglos76,0.0,324.0,"**TL;DR:** **Flash your Raspberry Pi 4, plug in an ethernet cable, connect the SSD disk and power up the device to turn the Raspberry Pi 4 into a full Ethereum 1.0 node or an Ethereum 2.0 node (beacon chain / validator)**

Some background first. As you know, we’ve been running into some memory issues \[1\] with the Raspberry Pi 4 image as Raspbian OS is still on 32bits \[2\] (at least the userland). While we prefer to stick with the official OS we came to the conclusion that, in order to solve these issues, we need to migrate to a native 64 bits OS

Besides, Eth 2.0 clients don’t support 32 bits binaries so using Raspbian would exclude the Raspberry Pi 4 from running an Eth 2.0 node (and the possibility of staking).

So, after several tests we are now releasing 2 different images based on Ubuntu 20.04 64bit \[3\]: Eth 1.0 and Eth 2.0 editions.

Basically, both are the same image and include the same features of the Raspbian based images. But they are setup for running Eth 1.0 or Eth 2.0 software by default

**Images take care of all the necessary steps**, from setting up the environment and formatting the SSD disk to installing and running the Ethereum software as well as starting the blockchain synchronization.

# Main features

* Based on Ubuntu 20.04 64bit
* Automatic USB disk partitioning and formatting
* Adds swap memory (ZRAM kernel module + a swap file) based on Armbian work \[7\]
* Changes the hostname to something like “ethnode-e2a3e6fe” based on MAC hash
* Runs software as a systemd service and starts syncing the Blockchain
* Includes an APT repository for installing and upgrading Ethereum software
* Includes a monitoring dashboard based on Grafana / Prometheus

# Software included

Both images include the same packages, the only difference between them is that Eth 1.0 runs Geth by default and Eth 2.0 runs Prysm beacon chain by default.

**Ethereum 1.0 clients**

* Geth \[8\]: 1.9.13 (official binary)
* Parity \[9\]: 2.7.2 (cross compiled)
* Nethermind \[10\]: 1.8.28 (cross compiled)
* Hyperledger Besu \[11\]: 1.4.4 (compiled)

**Ethereum 2.0 clients**

* Prysm \[12\]: 1.0.0-alpha6 (official binary)
* Lighthouse \[13\]: 0.1.1 (compiled)

**Ethereum framework**

* Swarm \[14\]: 0.5.7 (official binary)
* Raiden Network \[15\]: 0.200.0\~rc1 (official binary)
* IPFS \[16\]: 0.5.0 (official binary)
* Statusd \[17\]: 0.52.3 (compiled)
* Vipnode \[18\]: 2.3.3 (official binary)

# INSTALLATION GUIDE AND USAGE

# Recommended hardware and setup

* Raspberry 4 (model B) - 4GB
* MicroSD Card (16 GB Class 10 minimun)
* SSD USB 3.0 disk (see storage section)
* Power supply
* Ethernet cable
* 30303 Port forwarding (Eth 1.0) and 13000 port forwarding (Eth 2.0) \[4\]
* A case with heatsink and fan (Optional but strongly recommended)
* USB keyboard, Monitor and HDMI cable (micro-HDMI) (Optional)

# Storage

You will need and SSD to run the Ethereum clients (without an SSD drive there’s absolutely no chance of syncing the Ethereum blockchain). There are 2 options:

* Use a USB portable SSD disk such as the Samsung T5 Portable SSD.
* Use a USB 3.0 External Hard Drive Case with a SSD Disk. In our case we used a Inateck 2.5 Hard Drive Enclosure FE2011. Make sure to buy a case with an UAS compliant chip, particularly, one of these: JMicron (JMS567 or JMS578) or ASMedia (ASM1153E).

In both cases, avoid getting low quality SSD disks as it is a key component of you node and it can drastically affect the performance (and sync times)

Keep in mind that you need to plug the disk to an USB 3.0 port (blue)

# Image download &amp; installation

**1.- Download Eth 1.0 or Eth 2.0 images:**

[ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip](https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip)

sha256 34f105201482279a5e83decd265bd124d167b0fefa43bc05e4268ff899b46f19

[ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2.img.zip](https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2.img.zip)

sha256 74c0c15b708720e5ae5cac324f1afded6316537fb17166109326755232cd316e

**2.- Flash the image**

Insert the microSD in your Desktop / Laptop and download the file (Eth 1.0, for instance):

    wget https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip

Note: If you are not comfortable with command line or if you are running Windows, you can use Etcher ([https://etcher.io](https://etcher.io/))

Open a terminal and check your MicroSD device name running:

    sudo fdisk -l

You should see a device named mmcblk0 or sdd. Unzip and flash the image:

    unzip ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip
    sudo dd bs=1M if=ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 &amp;&amp; sync

**3.- Insert de MicroSD into the Raspberry Pi 4. Connect an Ethernet cable and attach the USB SSD disk** (make sure you are using a blue port).

**4.- Power on the device**

The Ubuntu OS will boot up in less than one minute but **you will need to wait approximately 10 minutes** in order to allow the script to perform the necessary tasks to turn the device into an Ethereum node and reboot the Raspberry.

Depending on the image, you will be running:

* Eth 1.0: Geth as the default client syncing the blockchain
* Eth 2.0: Prysm as default client syncing the beacon chain (Topaz testnet)

**5.- Log in**

You can log in through SSH or using the console (if you have a monitor and keyboard attached)

    User: ethereum
    Password: ethereum

You will be prompted to change the password on first login, so you will need to login twice.

**6.- Open 30303 port for Geth and 13000 if you are running Prysm beacon chain.** If you don’t know how to do this, google “port forwarding” followed by your router model.

**7.- Getting console output**

You can see what’s happening in the background by typing:

    sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog

Congratulations. You are now running a full Ethereum node on your Raspberry Pi 4.

# Syncing the Blockchain

Now you need to wait for the blockchain to be synced. In the case of Eth 1.0 This will take a few days depending on several factors but you can expect up to about 5-7 days.

If you are running the Eth 2.0 Topaz tesnet you can expect 1-2 days of Beacon chain synchronization time. Remember that you will need to setup the validator later in order to start the staking process (see “How to run the Eth 2.0 validator” section below).

# Monitoring dashboards

For this first release, we included 3 monitoring dashboards based on Prometheus \[5\] / Grafana \[6\] in order to monitor the node and clients’ data (Geth and Besu). You can access through your web browser:

    URL: http://your_raspberrypi_IP:3000
    User: admin
    Password: ethereum

# Switching clients

All clients run as a systemd service. This is important because in case of some problem arises the system will respawn the process automatically.

Geth and Prysm beacon chain run by default (depending on what you are synchronizing, Eth 1.0 or Eth 2.0) so, if you want to switch to other clients (from Geth to Nethermind, for instance), you need to stop and disable Geth first, and enable and start the other client:

    sudo systemctl stop geth &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable geth

Commands to enable and start each Eth 1.0 client:

    sudo systemctl enable besu &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start besu
    sudo systemctl enable nethermind &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start nethermind
    sudo systemctl enable parity &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start parity

Eth 2.0:

    sudo systemctl stop prysm-beacon &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable prysm-beacon
    sudo systemctl start lighthouse &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl enable lighthouse

# Changing parameters

Clients’ config files are located in the /etc/ethereum/ directory. You can edit these files and restart the systemd service in order for the changes to take effect. The only exception is Nethermind which, additionally, has a mainnet config file located here:

    /etc/nethermind/configs/mainnet.cfg

Blockchain clients’ data is stored on the ethereum home account as follows (note the dot before the directory name):

Eth 1.0

    /home/ethereum/.geth
    /home/ethereum/.parity
    /home/ethereum/.besu
    /home/ethereum/.nethermind

Eth2.0

    /home/ethereum/.eth2
    /home/ethereum/.eth2validators
    /home/ethereum/.lighthouse
    Hyperledger Besu and Nethermind

# Nethermind and Hyperledger Besu

These 2 great Eth 1.0 clients have become a great alternative to Geth and Parity. The more diversity in the network, the better, so you may give them a try and contribute to the network health.

Both need further testing so feel free to play with them and report back your feedback.

# How to run the Eth 2.0 validator (staking)

Once the Topaz testnet beacon chain is synchronized you can run a validator in the same device. You will need to follow the steps described here:

[https://prylabs.net/participate](https://prylabs.net/participate)

The first time, you need to create manually an account by running the “validator” binary and setup a password. Once you completed this step you can add the password to /etc/ethereum/prysm-validator.conf and start the validator as a systemd service

# Feeback appreciated

We put a lot of work trying to setup the Raspberry Pi 4 as a full Ethereum node as we know the massive user base of this device may have a very positive impact in the network.

Please, take into account that this is the first image based on Ubuntu 20.04 so there may be some bugs. If so, open an issue on Github or reach us on twitter ([https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM](https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM)).

But why will you need Ether? I may have some gaps in my understanding.  


Is Ether necessary for DeFi transactions? I see that there are currently DeFi Dapps that are in essence a bank which allows you to exchange different types of cryptos, lend for interest income or borrow. Can these cryptos/stablecoins be used on Ethereum blockchain in the future?

One argument I regularly see from other smart contract platforms is that they're going to support multiple languages or a more popular programming language for their smart contracts.

Not that developers can't pick up Solidity, once you know one language the core programming concepts carry over, but it's definitely a significant barrier to entry, especially when it's literally the only use case for that language.

eWASM is a great solution, create a virtual machine with the same ""architecture"" that can run platform-independent byte-code compiled from any language, and better yet, just piggy-back off all the work developers are already doing to get the Web independent of JavaScript.

It's a great move and eliminates what is in my opinion one of the remaining roadblocks for Ethereum development to skyrocket.",ethereum,I don't feel like people quite appreciate what a huge deal the eWASM implementation for ETH2 is going to be,313.0,0.94
ckh27,0.0,310.0,"Hi all. I’m new here but I wanted to cut through some noise. People are freaking out about fee basis for transactions on ethereum and how ETH 2 won’t solve this. You are not quite correct.

Here are three developers actively working on products in the trenches being asked direct no BS questions about what will fix this and can we use Ethereum NETWORK for low cost transactions.

https://youtu.be/PuZ8kUueG10

Watching this, you will probably not understand 90% of what they are talking about. Look at this video like getting to interview engineers at Apple as they are inventing the first iPhone and trying to follow along with what they are talking about in terms of their stack and how they will use various protocols to achieve their goals. Don’t expect to know every word but I loved it and it’s made me read a lot more into this.

TLDR: ethereum will exist as a world network that has gas fees. On top of that robust security will sit l2 dapps that make use of new cost saving methods to bring your transaction costs to pennies. They will use roll ups to achieve much of this. These products EXIST. And they are currently live and FUNCTIONING. They simply haven’t reached the mainstream conciousness yet.

1.) loopring allows for transactions at two orders of magnitude cheaper than current uses.

2. Synthetix is looking at around 1/100th price vs current prices.

NFT trading/buying in game and in dapp will leverage methods like this along the way to being on chain exhange costs to ZERO. 

These are various ways in which as the network dapps and platforms evolve they will bring the ultimate cost per user down to pennies.

In the short term, users are looking for things like binance or other exchanges as ways to cheaply trade. Correct, that is a centralized exchange built on a copy of Ethereum a blockchain technology, copy paste. They built it and solved fee issues by keeping you on chain with their token. Ethereum is not a trading portal in this way just now. Ethereum is a network for moving financial liquidity and other NFT around from place to place. It’s also much more.

At some point, you will have to pay to on ramp, and pay to off ramp, from the network. That will use gas. But your gas fees will shrink drastically by using the new tools and platforms which are running in Ethereum network.

Binance is a trading portal for penny stock cryptos.

Ethereum is a new world computer that securely and in a decentralized way allows you to transact financially across many platforms. You will interact with Ethereum network through many platforms. Ethereum is like the roads and highways of the world financial system, and they cost to use. The dapps sitting on top of the network are like little neighborhoods or cities or towns that you can use freely or next to free so long as you are still on the highway. 

It seems, and I am a noob, so listen to the pros, but You are suffering high fees right now because we are trying to use the system as a get on and off with every transaction and that is not what the system is.

You are buying the future of the internet. You are buying the next financial system. It is literally being invented as we speak.

Those who just want to trade crypto penny tokens should not use Ethereum right now. Within a year, you can use loopring via an exchange for such a thing but you are literally that early that it is being built.

It’s easy to copy the code remove then removed the decentralized component and make a trading exchange like binance. Might as well buy crypto on Robinhood. At least you get a wallet but it’s still not under your control if they want to manipulate the market. 

This is how early you are. There is SO. MUCH. MONEY. To be made with ethereum that your eyeballs are going to pop out of your head as an INVESTOR. If you are a short term trader... you’re early and are going to pay fees. If you’re looking to use Ethereum like PayPal TODAY, you are early. But within a year as the new roll ups take effect, the services which leverage roll ups built on top of Ethereum will drive your costs down and increase adoption.

You are that early. Hodl.

I’m sure some of this is not perfectly described but please do yourself a favor and watch the video. These are pros making the new world financial system and there is nothing close to the developer interest in this platform vs others. You may be right, the average day trader doesn’t care about decentralization, but the people building a world net financial and asset system DO. “If I asked people what they wanted... they would have said a faster horse.”",ethereum,TLDR DD: Ethereum is not in danger. 1/100th price transactions are around the corner.,310.0,0.94

I’m seeing a big influx of new users asking questions about where to buy their first bitcoin or ethereum and how to store it. I didn’t realize this before, but mega corps such as PayPal, Robinhood, and Wealthsimple do not allow their users to actually withdraw their crypto to their own wallet. You only have the option to buy and sell the coin on their platform. This is terrible for the community and not at all what cryptocurrency is all about. These companies are basically creating gated communities where they are profiting from pure speculation, and is detrimental because if you buy on these platforms you will never have the ability to actually hold your own coins. Ethereum is also a utility coin, for you to actually interact with the Ethereum network you need Ether. If you are never able to withdraw the coin, how will you ever interact with the network? You’ll never be able to try out these new Defi projects, stake your own coins, or try out any of the cool new Dapps that will for sure come out in the future. You will end up in the same place which spurred satoshi to invent BTC in order to avoid, which is having an entity or a government that can take away everything you own at any moment. They are also creating a system where they are taking your money to buy more BTC/ETH but they never have to sell their holdings. 

##Why is giving your money to these companies a bad idea?
If you are giving your money to these type of companies, then you are fundamentally misunderstanding the value proposition of BTC/ETH and are making an uninformed and bad investment decision. You are investing in the downfall of the community. You may make money in the short term, but the long term prospects of you surviving in this space is low, and decrease the potential for the market as a whole. The reason why Bitcoin was invented in the first place is so that people can transfer value over the internet without corrupt government or malicious companies being able to take that away from you. By giving money to these companies you are basically signaling to the market that you don’t understand the value of BTC or ETH at all, and you’re just here to try to make a quick buck. This in turn gives the mega corps more money to market to other newbies that are trying to make a quick buck and the cycle continues. These mega corps will end up dominating the market, and perhaps get to the point where they have unnatural influence on the direction of the chain. We may just end up exactly where we started and then what’s the point of even being on these block chains?

**If capitalism is your religion, money is our prayer, BTC is your denomination, then you are worshipping the devil by giving your money to these type of coroporations**

##Can these type of exchanges be good for some people?
I do see the value of these type of platforms for a very specific type of person: someone that only wants to speculate on BTC/ETH and don’t actually want to use, try, or participate at all in the community. By using a platform that doesn’t allow you to withdraw means that in the event you get hacked you will never lose money that the mega corp is unwilling to reimburse. But that just means that you make no attempt to take responsibility for your personal digital security, and will never truly own something online that other people don’t have control over. And that’s fine. Someone’s grandma that wants exposure to BTC without any of the risk might choose this route. But if that’s the case, then I would suggest you just invest in something else instead, because if you don’t see the importance of owning something yourself online then your not investing into BTC/ETH for the right reasons. I strongly implore you to understand what it means to hold your own coin and keys. There is definitely risk - it’s ALL the risk. But that’s the point, understanding digital identity and digital value to the point where it is absolutely EVERYTHING. There is a saying in the crypto community - **not your key, not your coin** and that’s exactly what these type of platforms are boxing you into. Crypto forces you to live in the new reality where understanding the underlying technology is everything. 

For those newbies out there looking the next moonshot - if you don’t fundamentally understand what you’re getting yourself into, how do you expect you’re going to find the next 10x 30x thing? Money is not just going to drop out of the sky

##Companies that don’t allow for withdraws:

*please let me know which companies don’t allow for withdraws and I’ll continue adding to this list so that newbies can have a quick look at which companies they should definitely not give their business to*

-	PayPal
-	RobinHood
-	Wealthsimple
-	Etoro

##So if you are new, where do you buy your BTC/ETH?
This question is going to be heavily dependent on what part of the world you are from. If you are about to post this type of question, please include which country you are from and what currency you want to buy in.

##What wallet do I withdraw to?
The community consensus for long term holding is hardware wallets. The most popular ones are Ledger and Trezor which are both multi-coin wallets. ONLY ever buy directly from these websites, and never from resellers as they could potentially have been tampered with. If spending extra money is out of the question for you, then consider looking into generating a wallet with virtual machine that is not connected to the internet. I’m not as familiar with this method of wallet generation so I’ll let more informed people chime in on this. Alternatively, the least secure way out of the bunch would be to use an extension wallet like Metamask or MyEtherWallet. 

*Ledger have previous had a data breach where their customers information was leaked to the web. The hardware wallets themselves are still secure, but Google the circumstances of this to make your own informed decision on whether or not you want to continue using this wallet.*

##I have questions, and I need help!
We understand that crypto is hard, and there are a barrage of information, traps, and scams out there on the internet, but it’s very difficult to help you when you don’t provide adequate information. You are much more likely to get support from the community if you are more specific with your question and provide as much details as possible *(never under any circumstance post your private key or 12/24 mnemonic key online while asking for help.)*",ethereum,PSA to Newbies coming into Ethereum and Bitcoin: Don’t buy from any exchange that doesn’t allow you to actually withdraw your coin,292.0,0.95

Unfortunately, many of us became victims of MakerDAO collateral auctions market. This market was brought to its knees today, resulting in:

**1) Losses affecting some of the MakerDAO Vault holders** (borrowers of DAI from the Multi-Collateral DAI system), and

**2) Losses affecting 100% of MKR token holders**, - minting enough MKR and selling them for DAI to cover the missing DAI in the system. The auctions will begin on Wednesday, March 18, 2020.

For the last 14 hours I've been focusing on determining the root cause of the problem, and determining WHAT CAN I DO? to prevent this collapse from ever happening again.

**Collapse of the MakerDAO Auctions.**

Losses above is a result of a short-term monopoly in the auction market of collateral liquidation of MakerDAO vaults becoming under-collateralized with price of collateral (ETH, BAT) on the decline. This monopoly existed for \~3.5 hours this morning, allowing a single Keeper to buy close to $4.5M worth of ETH in exchange for \~0 DAI + gas fees.

**The collapse negatively affected two classes of market participants:**

**1) Victim class #1: MCD Vault holders** who were being liquidated between \~10am EST until \~1pm EST

Please meet Paul, one of the people who lost money. Read his story:

Even 'Bitcoin\_Bender' is threatened. Not just him but his life and his family are going downhill:

**2) Victim class #2: MKR holders** who will be diluted on Wednesday, March 18th as a result of Flop auction - minting new MKR tokens and selling them at an auction until the auction proceeds cover the missing DAI ($4.5M DAI at the time of this writing).

**WHAT HAPPENED?**

Prior to \~10am EST, there were a lot of Keepers bidding against each other for collateral at 13% liquidation penalty. Keepers are software bots which monitor Vaults and participate in auctions for collateral of borrowers who became under-collateralized. Operators of such bots are incentivized with mandatory 13% liquidation penalty imposed on Vault collateral upon liquidation.

[https://docs.makerdao.com/auctions/the-auctions-of-the-maker-protocol](https://docs.makerdao.com/auctions/the-auctions-of-the-maker-protocol)

[https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/collateral-module/flipper-detailed-documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/collateral-module/flipper-detailed-documentation)

However, after 10am EST, a single liquidation auction bot was able to bid at 0 DAI (or slightly above) PER EACH COLLATERAL ETH BEING AUCTIONED, AND WIN THE AUCTION. As a result, this Keeper was effectively steal $4M worth of ETH collateral because the auction was designed to raise at least 4M DAI in exchange for the ETH that was auctioned during liquidations, however all except one Keepers stopping their operations, there was only one bidder. Any price above 0 would be accepted. As a result, but the Vault holders who supposed to receive some ETH back, never got any ETH back &gt; making the effective liquidation penalty to over 50% instead of 13%.

**Why did the Keeper's market collapse? Why most Keepers stop operating?**

Unfortunately, most Keepers stopped operating this morning due to the following reasons:

**Root cause #1: Catastrophic liquidity crunch.** Keepers simply ran out of DAI to bid in the collateral auctions due to

1.a I believe some Keepers were unable to continue Keeper operations due to inability to liquidate ETH fast enough for DAI.

1.b Some Keepers shut down due to squeeze (bought ETH for 170 DAI, and hours later can only sell for 130 DAI at a loss - which is way more than 13% liquidation penalty).

**Root cause #2: Network congestion.** This brought many Keepers to its knees. Even with liquidity, many were unable participating in auctions due to stuck transactions &amp; high gas costs. In addition, issues like longer client sync times + some Ethereum clients (like Parity) sufferring from known problems of keeping transactions stuck in Mempool for a very, very long time, amplified this problem.

**PROPOSED SOLUTION - MakerDAO Keeper Pool.**

**Why don't we pool our liquidity (non-custodial pool, Uniswap-style) and give Keepers some competition!?**

To prevent more people from losing their funds, I decided to fund development of a MakerDAO Keeper Pool, which will allow anybody to become a Keeper and participate in liquidations of collateral (to earn 13% liquidation penalty).

Background: During today’s Community Call (5 hours and still ongoing at the time of this writing), multiple members of the Maker community stressed importance of increasing # of Keepers servicing the MCD system in order to prevent yet another collapse of the Keepers market as it happened today.

To improve maturity of the Keepers market, increase the collective liquidity used by Keeper’s, engineers at [Protofire.io](https://protofire.io/) (developers of MakerDAO governance dashboard [https://mkrgov.science](https://mkrgov.science/), Solhint - Solidity Linter [https://github.com/protofire/solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint), maintainers of Gnosis Conditional Exchange [https://github.com/protofire/gnosis-conditional-exchange](https://github.com/protofire/gnosis-conditional-exchange)) and risk team + engineering team  at [Atomica.org](https://atomica.org/) (developers of [Atomica.org/unwind/](https://atomica.org/unwind/)) launched emergency efforts to ship one or more of the following ASAP:

1. **Web-based MakerDAO Keeper.** Perform liquidations of 3rd party collateral from your browser as a Keeper. Earn 13% liquidation penalty.
2. **Open Source Keeper Templates.** Run your own Keeper Bot on AWS - 1-click Installer for a MakerDAO Keeper Bot (open source Amazon Machine Image).
3. **Non-custodial MakerDAO Keeper Pool.** Earn yield on DAI/ETH/USDC/USDT/cDAI/Chai from a pool running multiple Keeper bots servicing MakerDAO ecosystem. Join/Exit/Add/Withdraw DAI/ETH/USDC/USDT/cDAI/Chai, and earn 100% of liquidation penalties earned by the Keeper (zero fee pool).

Ultimately, we aim to:

\- Upgrade the MakerDAO Keeper Pool to be a Keeper of Last Resort. Think of a Keeper backed by on-chain, guaranteed liquidity AND configured to participate in auctions with bids of at least 0.85 of the current ETH-DAI market price, as reported by oracles. So long as the Keeper Pool is operating, no Keeper will be able to take advantage of the system and cause yet another collapse of the MakerDAO Collateral Auction markets.

\- Ship 3rd party JavaScript / npm library + Android/iOS SDKs to embed Web-based Keeper or MakerDAO Keeper Pool join/exit/add/withdraw liquidity into your own dApp, protocol, product or service.

If anyone is interested in developing/observing/joining MakerDAO Keeper Pool (for example by running their own Keeper using hardened AWS AMI template, or by providing liquidity (DAI/ETH/USDC/USDT/cDAI/Chai) to a Keeper Pool) - feel free to join our working group working to ship a MakerDAO Keeper Pool ASAP - [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfekQcjT5up5Uh2W\_C2W0U5zJ5miLd5ott\_87CW8-dDH75TZg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfekQcjT5up5Uh2W_C2W0U5zJ5miLd5ott_87CW8-dDH75TZg/viewform)

A quick google search is instructive. China is, of course, [leading the charge in censoring dissenting views](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/03/how-authoritarians-are-exploiting-covid-19-crisis-grab-power), and other Southeast Asian countries are following suit. The UK is [heading down the same road](https://telecoms.com/503401/social-media-censorship-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/), and [Iran is arresting independent, ""critical"" reporting](https://www.voanews.com/extremism-watch/iran-uses-arrests-censorship-silence-critical-covid-19-coverage) on the virus.

This is a serious problem.

If you have a hunch that *somehow* crypto should be able to protect us from this danger, you're right: Ethereum has already facilitated bypassing such censorship in China. [As Forbes reports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2020/03/31/chinese-netizens-use-ethereum-to-avoid-chinas-covid-19-censorship/#7f7b360c5550), the Chinese government has been censoring an article discussing various aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak--but it is now [safely stored directly on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf3691b0ab12fff4fa9eb0eecd14878e06e7bbdf322320d248250a4026f67c3e6).

However, accessing this data is not simple, and posting it in the first place surely required obscure knowledge of Ethereum's inner workings and lots of trial-and-error.

If you have a web3 wallet like MetaMask, ETH for gas, and DAI for burning, you can create your own SmokeSignal message.

Feel free to burn a tiny amount of DAI for now, but as SmokeSignal gets more use, interfaces like ours will begin to filter out low-burn messages. By burning more DAI, an author can signal a higher level of seriousness and expect more visibility.

jdkanani,0.0,267.0,"The Matic team has put together a Proof-of-Concept for the Reddit Scaling Bake-Off. We think Matic is the most apt solution for the scaling requirements of Reddit, keeping in mind it’s current and future needs.

We believe that the Matic Layer 2 platform is the most complete solution out there in terms of the features and fits right in with what Reddit requires:

* Security via Plasma predicates on Ethereum: Reliable exits to Ethereum (Proof-of-Stake based decentralized multi-operator Plasma construction which mitigates mass exit occurrence)
* Composability (EVM Support), 
* Extremely high scalability with each sidechain (multiple sidechains in future, hence suitable for the scale of Reddit) 
* Ability to add custom smart contract features (via Ethereum Plasma predicates) for future product innovation

&gt;***TL;DR:*** *The Matic sidechain processed 3mn transactions over 12 hours with total gas fees of USD 3.52 as part of the Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off PoC.*  
&gt;  
&gt; The PoC used a few addresses only for the purpose of the demo, and the total throughput with millions of user addresses can go up to 7200 TPS per sidechain and these 3mn transactions could've been completed in a matter of 10-11mins. 

The PoC touches upon various aspects of the solution required – scalability that will need to meet Reddit’s requirements over time (more subreddits using Community Points), faster transaction times, inexpensive minting of Community Points, decentralization, accessible developer tooling, use of meta-transactions to pay for gas on behalf of users, open-source code, extensibility, ability to exit back to Ethereum, if needed and more.

**What is Matic?**

Matic Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that provides hybrid Proof-of-Stake and Plasma-enabled sidechains. We just released version 1 of our mainnet in May 2020 – [https://blog.matic.network/the-matic-network-mainnet-is-now-live/](https://blog.matic.network/the-matic-network-mainnet-is-now-live/).

Matic implements an account-based variant of MoreVP ([More Viable Plasma](https://ethresear.ch/t/account-based-plasma-morevp/5480)), with support for custom Plasma [predicates](https://plasma.build/t/predicates-in-matic-plasma/86). The Plasma framework with predicates is used to guarantee the security of assets and specific smart contracts using Plasma predicates, while arbitrary smart contracts are secured by a Proof-of-Stake network, with validators staking Matic tokens on Ethereum. Matic sidechains are essentially EVM-enabled chains and are conducive to ready deployment of Solidity smart contracts, essentially making it an easy tool for Ethereum developers to use it for scaling their DApps/Protocols.

**We are submitting the following:**

* A live proof-of-concept which demonstrates the scale required for the bakeoff and future requirements
   * **We did over 3,000,000 (3 million) transactions in our scaling PoC bulk run over a period of \~12 hours (yes that’s 3 mn transactions):**

Hello fellow ethereans, I hope you don't mind me having posted this on r/ethfinance a couple days ago. Not sure how much crossover there is between the subs, and I would love to hear some feedback on my thinking here!

These thoughts were prompted by Vitalik’s lovely [Endnotes on 2020](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html), Ray Dillinger’s recent statement entitled ‘[Bitcoin is a Disaster](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2020-December/036510.html) and some [subsequent discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/km8gzh/daily_general_discussion_december_29_2020/ghf8vt3/) in the daily, as well as the simple realization that 2020 gave us: things can get out of hand very quickly. 


Normally I wouldn’t post something like this because my idea is not fully formed, but also if I wait until the idea is fully formed I will never post it. I know this is not necessarily the best forum for such a long post, and it seems like the daily gets a lot more action here than individual posts, but I don’t write often so I don’t really have many other places to put this. 


I am extremely bullish on the price of eth denominated in USD, but one of the reasons for my bullishness is that it seems the world has an addiction to quantification, financialization and commodification. Ethereum enables this commodification, but may bring with it some negative externalities, namely increased abstraction and increased consumption. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Increased Abstraction**


This one may be pretty obvious for anyone following defi but abstraction and abstraction of abstraction is simple with ethereum. This talk entitled [Money and Debt and Digital Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyaWFicSihE&amp;feature=youtu.be) from Brewster Kahle at Devcon 5 is fascinating. In it he defines debt as quantified, transferable obligation, and goes on to describe how debt is the basis of our money systems. Essentially, most money today is future value abstracted into the now. Obviously ethereum is the best place for debt to live, but soon we will have quantified, transferable everything: socks, insurance, pieces of real estate… and it will all sit on top of ethereum if we are right. 


In the talk, Kahle describes the concept of the Hebrew Jubilee, which essentially de-commodified and de-abstractionized society every 50 years. What once had a price (in the form of debt owed): land, crops, future years of servitude, etc was definancialized as a way of stabilizing society. This release valve was built as a peaceful way of avoiding societal turmoil. Kahle even points out that every civil war during the period studied leading up to the time of Jubilee was a debt war. If we are dealing with a tool that makes it much more simple to commodify everything then we are also building an economic system that will quickly pile up abstraction. And with trustless smart contracts, it won’t be simple to reset this abstraction. Following this logic, building a more financialized society on ethereum may also be building a more socially unstable society.


As Wendell Berry says, ‘[it all turns on affection](https://spiritoftheland.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/It-All-Turns-On-Affection-Wendell-Berry.pdf)’... or at it’s base, the value and longevity of a thing or place people use comes from human care for that thing, not from the fact that it was financialized or can be exchanged. Movement away from ‘[the order of loving care](https://www.counterpointpress.com/dd-product/the-art-of-loading-brush/)’ is especially concerning in the commodification of farmland which has gone from being controlled by generations of people who could expect their grandchildren to live on that land, to being controlled by multinational corporations with an obligation to care for the place only insofar as a profit can be extracted from it. This is not to say that the ethereum community alone has the responsibility to reverse trends of commoditization, but it should be wary of the ability to tokenize real places and further abstract their value.


Personally, I am hopeful for the new things on ethereum that may have a monetary cost to execute, but value measured in more than money. These things will not be abstractions, but real and new things (or as real as non-physical things can be). The things I am most excited about are non-financialized projects like identity systems, forms of collaboration and mutual aid. I would love to hear of more examples of non-financialized value being created on ethereum. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Increased Consumption**


The concept of [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#:~:text=Induced%20demand%20is%20demand%20that,%2Dup%22%20as%20latent%20demand.) is that when infrastructure gains more capacity, demand rises to meet that capacity. This is true with road building in the world of transportation, and we have seen this with online shopping as Amazon built out highly efficient retail infrastructure. I think for [roads](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/air-pollution-from-cars.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20EPA%2C%20motor,percent%20of%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions) and [Amazon](https://depts.washington.edu/sctlctr/news-events/in-the-news/hidden-environmental-cost-amazon-prime%E2%80%99s-free-fast-shipping) the unsustainable results of increased infrastructure capacity are obvious. If ethereum is a novel and vastly improved infrastructure of value, then surely there are some unforeseen real world implications for this new capacity. In transportation, a recent response to some of the negative externalities caused by highway infrastructure (congestion, high maintenance costs, long commute times) has been to [destroy them completely](https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2017/07/06/freeway-fill-feeds-urban-revival). I am not suggesting we shut down ethereum before the party even gets started, but I am suggesting some of the most valuable things that could get built on ethereum are not more efficient ways of commoditizing and financializing things in order to serve human consumption patterns.


&amp;nbsp;


**Making Ethereum More Human**


Because of my concerns regarding abstraction and consumption, I hope that we are able to use ethereum to do more than defi, which so far seems to just be a (much) more efficient tool for financialization. As Vitalik alluded to in his discussion of the changing role of economics in ‘Endnotes on 2020’, economies seem to be eating politics and notions of democratic processes… or maybe more broadly, ‘money is eating the world’. Related listening is this compelling discussion from Yanis Varoufakis: [Is Capitalism Devouring Democracy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGeevtdp1WQ&amp;t) (I don’t necessarily agree with his approach btw). If eth is ‘[programmable money](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-next-money-upgrade), though, then maybe we should be careful of what it’s eating. 


Ethereum can allow relationship-less transactions, which is good for achieving certain tasks, but we should remember it is good to be trusted and to trust. If you don’t have some level of vulnerability to and trust in another person, you don’t have relationship. Blockchains allow for ‘trustless transactions’ - and when they do, they make us rely on fewer humans for our daily needs. Blockchains are absolutely a fantastic alternative to centralized intermediaries (like banks and big tech firms) meeting our needs, but they are also not a replacement for human relationship. If a trustless blockchain (or other impersonal piece of infrastructure like Amazon or a highway) can achieve what we want, public discourse can become more divided and alienating because we need to cooperate with fewer and fewer people to survive. Eric Klinenberg has a fantastic discussion of what he calls ‘social infrastructure’ in the physical world in his book [Palaces for the People](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557044/palaces-for-the-people-by-eric-klinenberg/). Vitalik also hit on this sentiment in his year end post, in his discussion of ‘digital nationalism’. I hope that ethereum can enable trustless transactions where they are helpful, but also that it can help us remove trust in centralized third parties and grow trust in the people we know and who live nearby to us, a kind of ‘**economic** social infrastructure’. I think that human connection, collaboration and relationship still holds serious value in making the world turn, and I hope we don’t forget it.",ethereum,"Thoughts on Ethereum, Commodification and Human Relationship: What Are We Really Building Here?",264.0,0.96

## Resource List

Before sending a transaction, try out some of the tips listed here to see the best times or fee depending on your urgency.

* [What Is Gas?](https://support.mycrypto.com/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-gas#:~:text=When%20you%20send%20tokens%2C%20interact,your%20transaction%20succeeds%20or%20fails.)) (MyCrypto)

## Why Gas Prices are High

Simply put, Ethereum is getting more and more popular! Every day, we see new users starting projects in NFTs / digital art, DeFi, governance - all with passionate communities that want to use Ethereum mainnet. It's been amazing to watch the usecases grow over the past few years.

At the end of the day, this means competition between users. Gas prices are subject to their own markets of supply and demand. When there are a lot of users trying to send transactions, gas prices will increase to reflect that.

This is easy to see in times of high volatility. For example, with the recent drop in ETH price on Feb 23, gas spiked to over **1000 gwei** as people tried to move their DeFi positions and arbitrage bots cleaned up market imbalances.

Having a market for block inclusion (measured by gas prices) is important because blockspace is limited. This means that there's a cap to what can be included per block. [Here's a chart](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit) of the block gas limit over time. If there wasn't a limit to the size of blocks, then any sort of data could be put onchain for near 0 cost - this would break the chain.

In the near term, high gas prices may fluctuate, but over the long term, mainnet Ethereum may see sustained high gas prices when compared to previous years. Emerging Layer 2 solutions, which package many thousands of transactions to settle back to mainnet, will be able to pay a much higher gas price.

If you are interested in diving deeper, check out this report from 0x researcher Remco Bloemen: [Scaling DeFi — Layer One](https://blog.0xproject.com/scaling-defi-layer-one-7eeb24aca4f0)

## What are L2s and which ones should you try?

L2 stands for ""Layer 2"" - this is a big umbrella term for chain constructions linked to a base chain (Layer 1) in some way. While there's a wide range of designs, they all offload some of the demand from mainnet Ethereum while maintaining some or most of the security guarantees.

We're so excited about L2s because they will bring a new flavor of scaling before the merge with Eth2 is ready. Scaling means lower transaction fees! Here's a list of L2s that are live now or soon that you can try out. Remember, even though these protocols are promising, they are still early versions that will need to be battle hardened over time.

* ZkRollups
   * [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) \- Exchange and Payment Protocol
   * StarkEx - Starkware based Exchange that hosts [Deversifi](https://www.deversifi.com/) (Exchange), Immutable (NFTs), and [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) (perpetual contracts)
   * [zKSync](https://zksync.io/) \- scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum
* Optimistic Rollups
   * [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.io/) (on testnet) - rollup built by [Offchain Labs](https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs)
   * [Fuel](https://fuel.sh/) \- ""Fuel empowers any person on Earth with fast, secure, and cost efficient ERC-20 transfers and swaps using the world’s most efficient Optimistic Rollup""
   * [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) (live in March) - Instant transactions and scalable smart contracts
* Sidechains (Technically not L2, but they are often used for similar purposes)
   * [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (fka [Matic](https://matic.network/)) - a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks
   * [xDAI](https://www.xdaichain.com/) \- a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive stable transactions

## Are other chains as good as they claim?

You may also heard other chains claiming ""come to \_\_\_\_ chain, we've got  low / no fees!!""  While on the surface it may seem appealing, there's probably more being left unsaid. A few potential explanations:

* They cut corners on decentralization - most frequently by increasing the hardware or bandwidth requirements for nodes. Ethereum takes this very seriously, and will only scale responsibly.
* They are hiding the true costs - like requiring users to stake funds to send transactions
* They will eventually run into the same issues as Ethereum - more users will inevitably lead to more congestion.

## Other Initiatives

* Near Term (weeks / months):
   * [Turbogeth](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/) \- this is an experimental Ethereum client that rearchitected Geth to create a more performant client. Everyone should try to run a Turbogeth node to help them get ready for a full release! The strategies for state management TG is using, once present in other client implementations, may allow for a safe increase to the block gas limit while also maintaining the ability for consumer hardware to run nodes.
* Medium term (\~4 months)
   * Eip-1559 - Potentially being included in the London network upgrade in July, 1559 comes with a whole host of benefits
      * more predictable tx inclusion (important for L2s like rollups)
      * elastic blocksize
      * reduce some MEV
      * balance issuance w/ burn: a potentially steady cap asset that is still secure
      * in protocol congestion oracle - (very important for L2s like rollups)
* Long term (\~12 months)
   * Eth2 - Proof of Stake, also called Serenity will also increase the total available blockspace through sharding. The Beacon Chain (the first piece of Eth2) is already live since December 2020, and the first hard fork is expected in mid-2021. The merge, projected for Q4 2021 / Q1 2022, will unite Eth1 and Eth2.

## What you can do to help

To start, point people to this post - this info is only useful if it gets in front of people!

Comment your gas suggestions / hacks - I'll make sure to update the list at the top with the best ones.

You can also try out the L2 solutions as they go live, give feedback about the onboarding experience, and ask exchanges to support withdrawing directly to L2s. This will improve the experience for the existing community and everyone else coming soon.

Hanzburger,0.0,234.0,"As you all know, Ethereum has been struggling with congestion and high fees. This has been anticipated for a while now so the past few years the development community has been working hard on a solution. This March Optimistic Rollups (ORUs) will have their public release.

# Why this matters

A quick ELI5 and history of scaling solutions for Ethereum and why this is a HUGE development. There are several kinds of scalability solutions for Ethereum: State channels like Plasma, sidechains, or rollups.

State channels are only usable for simple transfers so they are of no use for scaling smart contracts. Sidechains are essentially a separate blockchain with their own set of validators; and mostly the number of validators is quite low which introduces centralization issues.

Enter Optimistic Rollups. They support the EVM which means they can scale smart contracts. Optimism can do anywhere from 500 - 2000 TPS (current is \~14-34), with super low fees (less than a cent), while maintaining security and decentralization.

Further, Optimistic Rollups do not have a token so all gas on the rollup will be paid in ETH, keeping utility with the token and a better user experience.

# Path to adoption

Starting in March, any existing dApp on Ethereum can literally copy/paste their code to Optimism with little changes and get going. They made the process extremely easy with a compiler that developers can just plug in their existing Solidity code and it automatically ports everything to be Optimistic compatible.

Currently Synthetix is on Optimistic as a limited release. Uniswap, Chainlink, and Compound have already announced they will also migrate to Optimistic. With those large applications there and the easy of migration, a significant part of Ethereum's ecosystem will move there as well. Uniswap already has a demo of their Optimistic implementation, [Unipig](https://unipig.exchange/join-team), which has actually been released for a year. Once ORU is released in March it likely won't be long before we start seeing a flurry of announcements of projects migrating over.

There's still fees to get to L2 from L1, though. A key component to making this transition as seamless, easy, and affordable as possible is getting wallet providers on board to withdraw funds directly to L2. Coinbase has indicated support for Optimism, which means many users will never have to touch Layer 1. [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/), an open source wallet protocol that many projects use, already has an alpha build ([see preview](https://imgur.com/a/Ee09Ryf)) with Optimistic Rollups integrated.

This effectively eliminates the high gas fee issue for Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization. It's what everyone has been waiting for, and it's here in March!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** L2 adoption is coming much faster than everyone thinks. Optimistic Rollups will be open to public in March. Uniswap, Compound, and Chainlink will join Synthetix on Optimistic and others will follow. Coinbase and other wallets will support direct withdraws to Optimistic L2. Users can deposit their funds with a single transaction and then enjoy the complete ecosystem of Ethereum with extremely low gas fees and high TPS, while being entirely noncustodial and decentralized.",ethereum,The Future Is Optimistic!,234.0,0.98

vbuterin,0.0,231.0,"One of the challenges with rollups is that it is difficult to move between them: if you have funds in zksync but want to send them to someone who has a loopring account, currently the best approach is to withdraw to layer-1 and then re-deposit to loopring. This is really inefficient, costing you a full layer-1 gas fee, and furthermore it is very slow (especially with optimistic rollups where withdrawal takes a week). Here I propose a design for a decentralized/trust-minimized mechanism that allows users to move between rollups directly and potentially very quickly, as long as there is some liquidity provider willing to facilitate the trade. The mechanism only requires one side to be fully smart-contract/EVM capable; the other side can be a minimalistic rollup with no features other than sending coins. This mechanism could make life much easier for users trying to navigate the rollup ecosystem.

KevinMauro,0.0,201.0,"Hey so welcome. I'm having some trouble getting one of the biggest Ethereum investors to pay me for my work. 

Basically, one of ethereum's biggest investors has been profitting millions off my work without paying me. His name is Fred Ehrsam over at paradigm capital. I think it's EXTREMELEY relevant to Ethereum because he's investing my money all across the space, and i worry every night that other innocent people will be ripped off by him.

I met Fred shortly after he left Coinbase. I had taken a year off from medical school to seek funding for a very proftiable crypto trading algorithm. I knew that if i could get funding for the trading algorithm, then i could use the profits to develop a blockchain-based clinical treatment platform, and in turn treat more patients than i would otherwise as a doctor. Although i was making a very high percentage per day doing this trading strategy, i didn't have enough base capital to completely cover withdrawal fees from more than two exchanges. After examining graphs and other materials i prepared for him, Fred encouraged me to fully drop out of medical school to start a hedge fund with him. Together we came up with the name Paradigm Capital along with about 48 other hedge fund names. So, after that, I worked extremely hard to expand the algorithm from two to five exchanges...

At one point I was literally living out of my car in a Walmart parking lot to keep as much money in my trading algorithm as possible, because Fred kept saying he was going to send money to help see if it would scale to 5 exchanges. This guy had a net worth of $21 million at the time i believe. But he never wound up sending the money but kept promising he would. So after a lot more work I expanded the algo to 5 exchanges doing my part.

After a few months of expanding the algorithm i stayed at Fred's for a second time a few months later, where he asked me to shower in his room and I then introduced him to a girl i was into, but then he changed gears and told me that i didn't have enough social awareness to start a hedge fund with him. I pretty much knew right then that Fred had stolen or was going to steal my algorithm. But I didn't have enough proof until this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/02/14/crypto-heavyweights-coinbase-polychain-and-paradigm-invest-28-million-in-hong-kong-crypto-trading-firm/#8b074b2b833c) came out this year. So, my algo is making 100% per month profits for Paradigm Capital, and Fred has stolen a lot of money from me, like millions. 

Why is Fred so comfortable profitting off my work, and feeding himself off it? Why am I doing all the hard work out in the fields, and he's sitting back and eating fruit and  primping himself? Fred must have one of those delusions that he's my wife in the olden times. But I never wanted to have that kind of relationship with him. 

If I were an investor who wasn't involved in this, I would take into account that nothing Ehrsam has done aside from my arbitrage algorithm has worked. Augur, Veil, tBTC, MakerDAO... they've all been more problems than solutions. Why would you invest in an ecosystem who's philosophies give dozens of tries to a dishonest guy, while the honest, competent people are boxed out? Uhh... Fred literally killed the patients I could've treated as a doctor, and also those I could've treated on my blockchain platform. That's not good. Fred likes prediction platforms because they can be used to kill people through bounties. U think that's the best way to use a blockchain? Fred you will never kill me with a prediction market. You go try and do that with the money you stole from me. He's making decisions with money that's rightfully mine, spending it on projects that, in my opinion, won't be profitable nor do much to reduce suffering in the world. My opinion as a VC would be that if you're going to blow millions of dollars on high-risk projects, at least choose the ones that will have a positive societal impact. Not tBTC copycat projects and augur bounties etc

Regardless of sexuality, having a dishonest guy like Fred in your ""tribe""* only makes the rest of you look bad. Is it true that in SF you always have to have poke the noobs before doing business with them? Because that doesn't sound fair nor profitable. Divinity doesn't exclusively speak through people who love pretzel sticks.

Now PTT wants to Pied Piper the 14-year-olds over at /r/forniteBR into supporting Ethereum through ""community points"", hoping a changing of the guard on the East Coast will give him an opportunity to rise up? PTT, He will never let that happen. Not because you're gay, but because your tribe destroys people's lives, like Gawker once did. I will die making sure you don't get Ethereum off the ground. 

What is it about Fred that makes him so proud to keep profitting off my work without paying me? He's not my wife. Maybe he's not much a man, but that doesn't make him a woman living with me on a farm with me in 500 B.C. Do u know how easy it is to lie and backstab people to get ahead when you're smart? Actual smart people don't shoot lay-ups, they don't take the easy way. They go for the D U N K S. Does Joe Lubin's backstabbing mantra account for that?

I just want to be paid for my work.

Edit: ""Tribe"" is a bit of an intellectual meme these days that appears fairly often in crypto circles. It's based on something called ""Dunbar's number"" which states that social circles max out at 150 people, and everything you do is for those 150 people (your ""tribe""). It's not a reference to anything to do with sexuality, rather here it's meant to poke at one of crypto's main problems today. The ""tribe"" philosophy directly contradicts performing altruisitic acts for the good of humanity, or even for a group as large as a nation. Rather, you do selfish acts for people in your immediate social circle.

I'm posting this to help others like me who are just starting out in this crazy world of Crypto in the hopes that even 1 person is saved from being scammed like me. A short while back I fell for the Elon Musk giveaway scam. The scammers cloned his website completely and coupled with the anxiety they created with the time limit which seemed to be quickly whittling down I panicked and led by my stupidity and greed I guess I sent them 1 Ethereum in the hopes of getting 5 or so back. Obviously it was a ruse and I was out of pocket half my total savings, not to mention Ethereum subsequently jumped to 3 times it's value a short while later leaving me to feel even dumber.

If you're out there and getting wrapped up in the excitement and also being exposed to mass media and legitimate endeavors from people like Musk which make these sort of scams more believable to the uninitiated, please be aware and learn from me. Don't be like me. Nothing is free. And nobody will ever give you anything for free.

LOL. The regret is real and the fact that I fell for this is so humiliating. If you feel pity for my dumbass and wanna send me some ether please go ahead. 😂

Have a great day everyone.
P. S I've started saving again and will buy some again sometime soon.

BlueEstee,0.0,196.0,"Currently popular blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum (which is slowly changing) use **proof-of-work** algorithms to validate transactions and create new blocks. The idea is simple: each miner (participant in the network) has to solve a mathematical puzzle. The first one to do so gets rewarded, while the rest validate his solution. Miners can join mining pools in order to have a higher chance of earning a percentage of the mined coin.

Downfalls of proof-of-work:

* ***huge*** *operation costs* \- it is estimated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum burn over $1,000,000 of electricity and hardware costs per day
* *the* ***51% attack*** \- a group controls the majority of mining network, enabling it to create fraudulent block and manipulate past transactions
* ***centralization*** *risk* \- as of April 2019 China is the leader in bitcoin mining, controlling 65% of the processing power of the Bitcoin network.

**Proof-of-stake** does the same job in a vastly different way. Each participant deposits their coins for a certain period of time, then the algorithm chooses one validator based on their stake to validate transactions and create new blocks.

This solution uses a lot less resources compared to proof-of-work and mitigates the risk of centralization, as no specific and expensive equipment is required to become a validator.

It also makes the network more secure against the 51% attack, because it would require the attacker to purchase the majority of all existing coins to overtake the network.

TheWierdGuy,0.0,192.0,"Equating hashrates  to network security is yet another huge false narrative in the crypto space that needs to be debunked. PoW works as a resource intensive activity. Its security is a function of the aggregated cost of mining equipment depreciation and operation. The purpose of PoW is to allow for a decentralized operation of the network. This consensus mechanism is effective at achieving this as long as no single entity controls 51% or more of the processing power of the network. The perpetrator evaluates the feasibility and profitability of the attack by calculating how much it would cost to successfully execute it. Hashrates are a factor of this calculation, but what really matters is the $ cost. This is why hashrate is a not a good security metric. This results in two main implications:

* It is impossible to compare BTC's with ETH's security level by looking at hashrates alone because each uses a different hash function with dramatically different costs.
* Mining hardware becomes more efficient and cheaper over time, this means that the hashrate of a network must go up in order to maintain the same level of security over time.

&amp;#x200B;

Cost of a 51% attack:

51% of total aggregated cost mining cost (hardware deprecation + electricity) \* number of blocks needed to sustain the attack \* block time

&amp;#x200B;

The (number of blocks \* block time) time calculation may be different for various block chains, so it would be better to use a fixed standard in minutes for all PoW networks.

This would give us a standard metric that can be used as an apples to apples comparison and it would be a much more meaningful way to understand the historical progression of a network's security.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I understand that it may be impossible to calculate the cost of a 51% attack, but it seems reasonable to assume that we can arrive at an approximation of the current aggregated cost of operating the network (regardless of factors like availability of new hardware), and that this number however imperfect it might be would still be a better reference than relying solely on raw hashrate.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: A lot of people are making very good points in the comments, including the fact that network revenue and the hardware availability should be taken into account. What I am really trying to get to is that we don't need to produce a number that is ""right"", we just need to get to an approximation or a range. As imperfect as it may be, it would most likely be better than just looking at raw hashrates because this metric alone is almost meaningless.",ethereum,"The security level of PoW networks should be measure in dollars, and it should reflect the cost of executing a 51% attack.",192.0,0.9

SrPeixinho,0.0,185.0,"I often need Ethereum account creation and message signing/verification on my web apps. Sadly, every library with that functionality (web3, ethers, ethereumjs, etc.) increases my apps sizes considerably; from 300kb to 1mb, even minified, which is annoying, specially if the site is lightweight. To improve it, I started from `elliptic.js` and did a lot of aggressive, manual pruning. The result so far is a `50kb` library called [`nano-ethereum-signer`](https://github.com/MaiaVictor/nano-ethereum-signer) capable of generating accounts, hashing with keccak, signing messages and verifying signatures: just the minimal functionality needed to cook your own password-less, plugin-less login system. It is 10-20x smaller than all alternatives I've tried, and there is still room for improvements (such as using `BigInt`).  I still need to add the license since I copied a lot of code from other projects.

*Edit: since so many seem to appreciate this, could we set up a bounty for improving it? I won't be able to work on it further, but it is important for my projects. Sadly, ECDSA on pure JS is still slow (500 sigs/second). Optimizing this (with WASM?) and decreasing the size further would be highly valuable to me, so I'd gladly contribute with such a bounty.

It has been tested at large events ([EthDenver](https://forum.poa.network/t/poa-and-xdai-take-center-stage-at-ethdenver-2019/2016)) where it handled greater than expected loads with ease; securely processing thousands of transactions for only a few thousandths of a cent. xDai has a proven track record of security and scalability, and it is available for deployment today. While our solution may not be the fastest submitted, it's still well within the requested benchmarks yet brings the peace of mind of dependability and resilience the competition simply cannot offer.

&amp;#x200B;

**2 projects - 1 mission**

The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off presented a unique opportunity for collaboration and we were excited to challenge ourselves within such a limited timeframe. Our solution was achieved on the [xDai Stable Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/), a layer-2 sidechain which is 100% compatible with Ethereum. Real-time and historical data visualizations with custom dashboards were implemented in collaboration with [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/). Through this joint effort, we were able to demonstrate a solution that is not only fast but efficient and inexpensive, on a tried and true network that’s in use at this very moment.

**Challenge Results**

Note: [Our challenge Gitbook details our process, results, costs and other details\*\*.\*\*](https://challenge.xdaichain.com/)

The challenge asked teams to handle the following transactions over the course of 5 days:

* 100,000 point claims (minting &amp; distributing points)
* 25,000 subscriptions
* 75,000 one-off points burning
* 100,000 transfers

To meet this challenge, we ported over contracts and created a [custom load script](https://github.com/xdaichain/reddit-scaling-demo) to simulate transactions for a single subreddit on xDai.  We processed 300,000 transactions in under 4.5 hours, achieving **25X+ efficiency** from the original requirements.

Reddit contracts were whitelisted resulting in **0 gas fees for transactions and contract deployment.** In addition to the custom load script which tested chain capacity with TMOONs, we also created a continuous load script to simulate more natural transactional flows with TBRICKs.

**Splunk Team Collaborative Effort**

The ability to monitor and assess blockchain data is vitally important for accessibility, transparency, and ultimately, adoption. The blockchain team at Splunk created a number of visual dashboards for the challenge to display transactions, block times, validators and all other relevant data on xDai. These dashboards give users the opportunity to find relevant patterns, troubleshoot node issues should they arise, and dig into both historical and real-time data.

The results of our load testing can be viewed using the custom Splunk dashboards created for the competition.

**Usability and Interoperability**

As mentioned above, the xDai Stable Chain is fully interoperable with the greater Ethereum ecosystem. In this section, we show how users can easily move MOON tokens to and from xDai using a custom plugin ([Burner Wallet](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/burner-wallet)) connected to the TokenBridge architecture. We also are proud to spotlight community created tools by [Austin Griffith](https://www.reddit.com/user/austin_concurrence/), including the [xmoon.exchange](https://xmoon.exchange/), and a multiplayer game in active development.

All transactions completed for the challenge are transparent on-chain and can be viewed using our very own [xDai BlockScout explorer](https://www.xdaichain.com/).

diglos76,0.0,165.0,"**TL;DR:** **Flash your Raspberry Pi 4, plug in an ethernet cable, connect the SSD disk and power up the device to join the Eth2.0 Onyx testnet.**

The image takes care of all the necessary steps to join the Eth2.0 Onyx testnet \[1\], from setting up the environment and formatting the SSD disk to installing and running the Ethereum Eth1.0 and Eth2.0 clients as well as starting the blockchains synchronization (for both Geth Eth1.0 Goerli \[2\] and Prysm \[3\] Eth2.0 Beacon Chain).

You will only need to create a validator account, send the deposit of 32 Goerli ETH to the Onyx contract and start the validator systemd service.

**MAIN FEATURES**

* Based on Ubuntu 20.04 64bit. See \[1\]
* Automatic USB disk partitioning and formatting
* Adds swap memory (ZRAM kernel module + a swap file)
* Changes the hostname to something like “ethnode-e2a3e6fe” based on MAC hash
* Automatically syncs Eth1 Goerli (Geth) and Eth2 Beacon Chain (Prysm)
* Includes an APT repository for installing and upgrading Ethereum software
* Includes a monitoring dashboard based on Grafana / Prometheus

**SOFTWARE INCLUDED**

* Geth: 1.9.15 \[5\] (official binary) configured for syncing Goerli Testnets
* Prysm: 1.0.0alpha13 \[6\]
   * Beacon Chain (official binary)
   * Validator binary (official binary)
* Grafana 7.0.4 \[7\]

# INSTALLATION GUIDE AND USAGE

R**ECOMMENDED HARDWARE AND SETUP**

* Raspberry 4 (model B) - 4GB or 8GB ((GB highly recommended)
* MicroSD Card (16 GB Class 10 minimum)
* SSD USB 3.0 disk (see storage section)
* Power supply
* Ethernet cable
* 30303 Port forwarding (Eth 1.0) and 13000 port forwarding (Eth 2.0)
* A case with heatsink and fan (Optional but strongly recommended)
* USB keyboard, Monitor and HDMI cable (micro-HDMI) (Optional)

**STORAGE**

You will need and SSD to run the Ethereum clients (without an SSD drive there’s absolutely no chance of syncing the Ethereum blockchain). There are 2 options:

* Use an USB portable SSD disk such as the Samsung T5 Portable SSD.
* Use an USB 3.0 External Hard Drive Case with a SSD Disk. In our case we used a Inateck 2.5 Hard Drive Enclosure FE2011. Make sure to buy a case with an UASP compliant chip, particularly, one of these: JMicron (JMS567 or JMS578) or ASMedia (ASM1153E).

In both cases, avoid getting low quality SSD disks as it is a key component of you node and it can drastically affect the performance (and sync times). Keep in mind that you need to plug the disk to an USB 3.0 port (in blue).

**IMAGE DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION**

**1.- Download the image:**

[http://www.ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2-onyx.img.zip](http://www.ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2-onyx.img.zip)

SHA256 13bc7ac4de6e18093b99213511791b2a24b659727b22a8a8d44f583e73a507cc

**2.- Flash the image**

Insert the microSD in your Desktop / Laptop and download the file:

Note: If you are not comfortable with command line or if you are running Windows, you can use Etcher \[8\]

Open a terminal and check your MicroSD device name running:

    sudo fdisk -l

You should see a device named mmcblk0 or sdd. Unzip and flash the image:

    unzip ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2-onyx.img.zip
    sudo dd bs=1M if=ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fdatasync status=progress

**3.- Insert de MicroSD into the Raspberry Pi 4. Connect an Ethernet cable and attach the USB SSD disk** (make sure you are using a blue port).

**4.- Power on the device**

The Ubuntu OS will boot up in less than one minute but **you will need to wait approximately 7 minutes** in order to allow the script to perform the necessary tasks to join the Onyx testnet (it will reboot again)

**5.- Log in**

You can log in through SSH or using the console (if you have a monitor and keyboard attached)

    User: ethereum
    Password: ethereum

You will be prompted to change the password on first login, so you will need to log in twice.

**6.- Forward 30303 and 13000 ports in your router (both UDP and TCP).** If you don’t know how to do this, google “port forwarding” followed by your router model.

**7.- Getting console output**

You can see what’s happening in the background by typing:

    sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog

**7.- Grafana Dashboards**

There are 2 Grafana dashboards to monitor the node (see section “Grafana Dashboards below”.

See \[9\]

# The Onyx Eth2.0 testnet

Onyx is an Eth2.0 testnet created by Prylabs according to the latest official specification for Eth2.0, the v0.12.1 \[10\] release (which is aimed to be the final).

In order to run an Onyx Eth 2.0 node you will need 3 components:

* An Eth1.0 node (Goerli testnet in sync)
* An Eth2.0 Beacon Chain (Prysm Beacon Chain in sync) connected to the Eth1.0 node
* An Eth2.0 Validator (Prysm Validator) connected to the Beacon Chain

The image takes care of the Eth1.0 Geth and Eth2.0 Beacon Chain configurations and syncs. So, once flashed (and after a first reboot), Geth (Eth1.0 client) starts syncing the Goerli testnet and the Beacon Chain (Eth2.0 client) gets activated through the Prysm client, both as systemd services.

When the Goerli testnet sync is completed, the Beacon Chain starts syncing. Both chains are necessary as the validator needs to communicate with them (as explained below).

**Activating the validator**

Once Goerli and the Beacon chain are in sync you have just one task left, configure the Validator for enabling the staking process.

The image provides the Prysm validator client for running the staking process. With this validator, you will create an account with 2 keys (public and private) and get an HEX string  that needs to be sent to the Eth 1.0 blockchain as data through a 32 ETH transaction.

The Beacon Chain (which is connected to the Eth1 chain) will detect this deposit (which includes the validator public key) and the Validator will be activated.

So, let’s get started. Geth Goerli testnet and the Beacon Chain are already syncing in the background. Goerli will sync in about 1 hour and the Beacon Chain in about 2 hours (so this will take 3 hours overall).

The easiest way to enable a Prysm validator is to use the Prylabs web portal to get Goerli ETH (testnet ETH) and follow their instructions:

[https://prylabs.net/participate](https://prylabs.net/participate)

Let’s break this down:

**Step 1) Get Prysm**

Nothing to do here. Prysm is already installed.

**Step 2) Get GöETH — Test ETH**

We need 32 ETH to stake (it is fake ETH as this is a tesnet). Prylabs created a faucet with a great UI so you can easily get 32.5 Goerli ETH.

You will need a web3 provider to use the faucet. Install Metamask browser extension (if you don’t  have it running yet). Create an account and set the network to “Goerli test network”  (on the top of the Metamask screen). Now, click once in “Metamask” and then click “Need GoETH?” button. Confirm the transaction.

Once funded, you will see something like this:

    You are 0x0b2eFdbFB8EcaF7F4eCF6853cbd5eaD86510d63C and you have 32.5 GöETH.

**Step 3). Generate a validator public / private key**

Go to your Raspberry Pi console and run the following command (make sure you are logged in with your ethereum user):

    validator accounts create

Press  return to confirm the default path

Enter a password twice (you will need it later to run the validator so write it down and be careful). Once finished, your account will be created (under the /home/ethereum/.eth2validators directory) containing, among other info, your validator keys.

    ===================================================================
    ***Enter the above deposit data into step 3 on https://prylabs.net/participate***

Copy this data (**just the hexadecimal part, from 0x to the last number**), go back to step 3 of Prylabs website and paste it into the field “Your validator deposit data”.

**Step 4) Start your beacon chain &amp; validator clients**

Beacon chain is already running in the background so let’s configure the validator. Just edit the  /etc/ethereum/prysm-validator.conf file and replace “changeme” string with your password (you can use nano or vim editors). Now run:

    sudo systemctl enable prysm-validator &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start prysm-validator

Check if everything went right by running:

    sudo systemctl status prysm-validator

**Step 5) Send a validator deposit**

We are almost there. Just click the “Make deposit” button and confirm the transaction.

Done!

Now you need to wait for the validator to get activated. In time, the beacon chain will detect the 32 ETH deposit (which contains the validator public key) and the system will put your validator in queue. These are the validator status that you will see during the activation process:

* UNKNOWN STATUS
* DEPOSITED (the beacon chain detected the 32 ETH deposit with your validator public key)
* PENDING (you are in a queue for being activated)
* ACTIVATED

# Grafana Dashboards

We configured 2 Grafana Dashboards to let users monitor both Eth1.0 and Eth2.0 progress. To access the dashboards just open your browser and type your Raspberry IP followed by the 3000 port:

    http://replace_with_your_IP:3000
    user: admin
    passwd: ethereum

There are 3 dashboards available:

* Geth Goerli: Eth1.0 node status
* Prysm Validator: Eth2.0 validator status
* Ethereum on ARM node: Raspberry Pi board Status

Lot of info here. You can see for example if Geth is in sync by checking (in the Blockchain section) if Headers, Receipts and Blocks are aligned or easily find  the validator status.

# Whats's next

We are planning a new release for a multi testnet Eth2.0 network including Prysm, Teku and Lighthouse client (and hopefully Nimbus).

The StarkEx engine has on-chain and off-chain components. Generally speaking, off-chain is for heavy-duty computation and storage, while on-chain is for the computationally-lean verification , state commitment, and data-availability required for using the escape hatch.

For a more detailed overview read our [medium post](https://medium.com/starkware/starks-over-mainnet-b83e63db04c0). Note, however, that this post describes StarkEx in Validium mode (off-chain data), whereas in this bake-off we demonstrated StarkEx in Rollup mode (on-chain data).A note on terminology: Rollups using cryptographic proofs are often called “ZK-Rollups” even when the proofs are not Zero-Knowldge (ZK); we shall use this common term when referring to the general class of proof-based Rollups.

# StarkEx Demo for the Reddit Bake-off

## Cost Analysis

**TL;DR**

* StarkEx can operate with either on-chain data (Rollup mode) or off-chain data (Validium mode).
* In this bake-off, we operated in **Rollup mode**. Our total Mainnet on-chain gas cost was 94.47M gas, which translates to an average of **315 gas per Tx**. The off-chain costs were a small fraction of this. These are actual measured Mainnet costs, not optimistic estimates.
* Running the bake-off in **Validium mode** would have cost 5M gas total, which is **under 17 gas per Tx**. StarkWare already has a StarkEx system in Validium mode deployed on Mainnet.
* StarkEx outperforms other Rollup solutions
* It outperforms existing ZK-Rollups in both on-chain and off-chain costs.
* It fundamentally out-performs Optimistic Rollups (OR) in on-chain costs. Because cost is dominated by on-chain costs, it has a fundamental cost advantage over OR.

**Details**

There are two sets of costs in a StarkEx system:

1. On-chain costs

* Submitting and verifying proofs
* (Only In Rollup mode:) publishing data pertaining to state changes

1. Off-chain costs: running the StarkEx cloud service, and specifically the provers

In Rollup mode, the on-chain portion is the dominating part of the cost. Note that the actual on-chain cost per Tx is much lower in ZK-Rollup solutions than in OR solutions, since the amount of data that needs to be published is much smaller.

In the bake-off, the actual on-chain costs were 94.47M, (average of 315 gas per Tx) and the off-chain costs were negligible in comparison (less than 5% of on-chain cost).

At a gas cost of 70 gwei, this cost us 6.6 ETH, which at an ETH price of $230 cost $1,518 (average on-chain cost of ¢0.5 per bake-off Tx). Naturally, the USD price fluctuates with the price of gas on Ethereum, and the price of ETH.

94.5% of on-chain costs were due to operating in Rollup mode, i.e. for posting the transaction data on-chain (section 1.b above). Had we run the same in Validium mode, the on-chain costs would have been a mere 5M gas (average of under 17 gas per Tx), and would have cost 0.35 ETH, which translates to a total of $80.5 (average of ¢0.02 per bake-off Tx).

On-Chain Gas Consumption Summary:

|**StarkEx**|Cost per Batch of 300K Txs|Amortized Cost per Tx|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rollup|94.47M gas or  \~$1.5K|315 gas or  ¢0.5|
|Validium|5M gas or \~$80|17 gas or  ¢0.02|

&amp;#x200B;

With StarkEx, the verification cost grows only poly-logarithmically with respect to the batch size. This is displayed most clearly in Validium mode, where data is not posted on-chain, and thus on-chain cost scales sub-linearly (logarithmically) with batch size. Consequently, at high scale, the amortized on-chain cost of a single Tx in Validium mode goes to zero with batch size, and the off-chain cost dominates. In terms of off-chain cost, STARKs have a significant advantage over SNARK-based solutions: latest state of the art STARK provers are 20x faster than state of the art SNARK provers and this speedup is based on fundamental cryptographic reasons¹.

In general, the actual cost depends on various factors, including:

1. As stated above, on the price of gas on Ethereum, and the price of ETH.
2. System throughput (number of Tx per second): StarkEx achieves efficiency via batching, as verification cost is only logarithmic wrt the batch size. The bigger the batches, the lower the cost per Tx. Generally speaking, higher throughput lends itself to bigger batches, and thus lower average cost per Tx.
3. Maximal latency allowed between Tx and its submission on-chain: the bigger the allowed latency, the bigger the batches, and the lower the cost per Tx. Larger latency also better enables timing proof submissions for when gas costs are lower.
4. Data Availability solution: as mentioned above, the current bakeoff was in Rollup mode, where most of the system cost is the on-chain data availability. Running in Validium mode would have reduced the on-chain cost by a factor of 20x.
5. Number of concurrent *competing* off-chain proof operators and mechanism of distributing proofs between them: generally speaking, if several proof operators generate proofs in parallel and compete for submitting them, the off-chain costs grow, as those operators all need to be compensated for their on-going cloud costs.
6. Business relationship/agreement with the proof operators: if Reddit runs the proof operator itself, the off-chain costs are just the out-of-pocket costs of running the service (including prover license/usage fees). If other entity/ies provide the service, the cost could be higher.
7. Whether the proofs contain just Reddit Txs, or are they bundled together with Txs from other applications: since batching lowers costs, bundling Reddit Txs alongside Txs from other applications into the same proofs can lower the average cost per Tx.
8. Optimizations based on usage patterns: StarkEx contains various optimisations within each batch (e.g. bundling together different Txs that relate to the same accounts). In some cases, the usage patterns of the application benefit more from these optimisations (e.g. if in many cases, a batch contains many Txs for the same accounts, the average cost will be lower).

The cost quoted above for the bake-off can provide a decent rough cost estimate for a live system (once again, assuming on-chain data availability; otherwise they would be considerably lower). More exact estimates could be provided once we get tighter specifications for the desired system configuration.

Note that the costs quoted above are the actual variable costs for running the bake-off on Mainnet. We have read various publications from competing scaling solutions quoting costs that are merely estimates, and often neglect significant parts of the actual cost structure, as typically they don’t yet have a fully functional product. As far as we know, STARK (as a cryptographic protocol) and StarkEx (our specific implementation for this use case) are significantly more efficient than other cryptographic proof systems. For example, ethSTARK, our EF-funded open-source code, is 20X faster than any other proof system we know of. This efficiency translates to a cost advantage over other alternatives, when all considerations are taken into account.

## System Architecture

**Highlights**

* Scalability: High throughput enabled by batching transactions.
* Integrity: Cryptographic proofs and commitments ensure true ownership of Points.
* Accessibility: Support by leading wallets, and no on-chain operations required from users.

**System Components**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v399tflc4yd51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7385cb25bc135bb0b2183358a1d2cee9d0c62480

***Minting (1)***

Minting is done by transferring Points from the moderator accounts to chosen users (per Reddit’s specification, users claim these Points). This is done via the Moderator API.

***UX — Subscribe, Tip, and Burn (2)***

*Initiating User Commands*

StarkWare built a Reddit Chrome Extension (RCE) that monitors user activity on the Reddit website. The RCE catches events such as Subscribe (clicking the subreddit “JOIN” button), and Tip (adding a response starting with “/tip”), and interprets them appropriately. Whenever the RCE catches a user command, it constructs the required StarkEx transaction, and requests the user to sign it with their selected wallet. The signed transactions are passed by the RCE to the StarkEx Scalability Engine (SESE) in the cloud. StarkEx batches transactions, generates a STARK proof attesting to their integrity, and writes to Ethereum the proof, a commitment to the updated user balances data structure, and the modified user balances.

*Frictionless User Experience*

Users limiting themselves to the basic Reddit Point interactions (namely: claiming Points, subscribing to a subreddit, tipping other users, and burning Points) need not interact with Ethereum, and in particular, no on-chain registration is required. Only when users choose to interact with Ethereum, e.g. to withdraw or deposit Points, do they need to register on-chain as well. On-chain registration simply means linking a user’s Ethereum address with their StarkEx account.

***Wallet Support (3)***

*Native Integration*

Several wallets support the StarkEx ECDSA signature scheme and APIs, offering maximal security to their users. These wallets securely present to the user StarkEx transactions in a clear and readable format, so the user knows what they are signing. This ensures that any attempts at tampering with the message (e.g. by malware) can be detected by the user prior to signing.

Currently provided by: Ledger, Authereum, Portis, and Argent (via WalletConnect).

*Standard Integration*

Where Native Integration with StarkEx has yet to be completed, we opted for Standard Integration. For the Reddit bake-off, these wallets are used strictly for the secure storage of the user’s private key. When using such a wallet, the RCE itself signs the message with the key it obtains from the wallet.

Currently provided by: MetaMask and Torus.

***StarkEx Scalability Engine (4)***

The SESE runs in the cloud, and is responsible for batching transactions, generating a STARK proof attesting to their integrity, and updating a commitment (a hash) to the new state of accounts following this batch. StarkEx sends to Ethereum the STARK proof, alongside the commitment. The StarkEx smart contract system checks the proof, and if it is accepted, it stores the commitment on-chain. StarkEx accompanies each proof sent to Ethereum with the list of modified account balances verified by the proof as well (aka on-chain data availability), thus ensuring the anti-censorship mechanism described below.

***StarkEx Batch Explorer (5)***

The StarkEx batch explorer connects to the SESE. It allows viewing the batches created, and the transactions in each batch. The batch explorer also displays a readable format of the modified accounts data that StarkEx puts on-chain, which the explorer reads directly from the blockchain. Note that the set of transactions displayed requires trust in the explorer, as it cannot be derived merely from observing the commitment and the modified accounts recorded on the blockchain.

**Anti-Censorship Mechanism**

***Serving All or No One***

In StarkEx, a user should always be able to withdraw their Points to the Ethereum blockchain, as ERC-20 coins. In the standard flow, a user sends a withdrawal request to the SESE via an off-chain API. Off-chain API service requires trust in the Operator (e.g. system availability). If a withdrawal request isn’t serviced by the Operator, the user submits a Full Withdrawal request (think of it as the equivalent of filing a complaint to a trustless party) to the StarkEx-Reddit Smart Contract. This triggers a grace period during which the Operator may submit a proof serving the withdrawal request. If that happens, the system reverts to its normal operation. Otherwise, the smart contract freezes the StarkEx system by declining to process any further updates.

***Withdrawing Points from a Frozen StarkEx***

When the system is frozen, users can claim their Points and withdraw them on-chain , by demonstrating to the smart-contract that they indeed own the claimed assets. The commitment stored on-chain is actually a Merkle tree commitment to the user balances. A user can withdraw funds directly from the contract by providing a Merkle authentication-path from their account (a leaf in the tree) to the root (the commitment kept on-chain). The *on-chain data-availability* sent with every batch processed contains the information needed to allow a user to construct such authentication paths (the data is broadcast solely for this purpose).

Ethereum 1.0

**NETHERMIND**

The Nethermind client is finally included and these is great news for the eth1 client ecosystem. On one hand it took a while, mainly for two reasons. .NET support for ARM \[7\] is quite recent and, on the other hand, getting a self contained binary for ARM is not an easy task (although Microsoft has a nice cross-compilation tool set). Besides, Nethermind has some native dependencies and it took some time to figure out how .NET handles this and how to put all config and system files together (by the way, thank you very much to the Nethermind team for their great support,).

Nethermind is a great option for running an ETH1 node. .NET performs quite well and synchronization time is fantastic.

Keep in mind that Nethermind doesn’t download receipts and bodies by default, this is why the sync time is so fast. You can change this behaviour by editing mainnet.cfg file (see below).

As always, you need to enable the service and disable the other ETH1 clients. For instance, if you are running Geth:

    sudo systemctl stop geth &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable geth  

sudo systemctl enable nethermind &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start nethermind

You can tweak the client parameters here (currently only mainnet.cfg is supported)

/etc/nethermind/configs/mainnet.cfg

Systemd parameters:

/etc/ethereum/nethermind.conf

As always, output is redirected to syslog.

tail -f /var/log/syslog

ARM32 version has some problems, though. There are lots of crashes because of memory problems (as well as the other clients). This is certainly related to the ongoing “allocation memory bug” \[8\]. See “Raspberry Pi 4” section for further info. Feedback is appreciated.

**HYPERLEDGER BESU**

Besu is an enterprise-grade Java-based Ethereum client developed by Pegasys \[6\]. Thank you very much to Felipe Faraggi for reaching out and give us further information about it.

Besu is now included in Ethereum on ARM (64-bits only) and you can run it as a systemd service (please see Nethermind instructions above).

    sudo systemctl stop geth &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable geth sudo systemctl enable besu &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start besu  

It runs fine on NanoPC-T4 but needs more testing (particularly on the memory side). Please, give it a try and report your feedback to us. We will post more info soon, including full sync data.

Ethereum 2.0

**PRYSM**

Prysmatic Labs put a lot of work on their Prysm ETH2 client and the changes / improvements are impressive \[9\]. Additionally, they took ARM support very seriously from the beginning and are now releasing official binaries for ARM64. Thank you very much to the team!

We are getting 4-6 blocks/second (compared to 0.1/0.2 of 0.3.1 version.) This is a huge improvement and allows a NanoPC-T4 to sync the beacon chain in less than a day (23 hours).

To start syncing the beacon chain just start the service by running (again, stop and disable other clients):

sudo systemctl start prysm-beacon

If you want to be a validator, please, follow their instructions \[10\]. You can run the validator binary to do so.

Hardware

**NANOPC-T4**

Rockchip boards run on a legacy 4.4 Linux kernel and that means that it’s missing lots of improvements from the mainline branch, particularly on the storage side. We tried 5.4 and 5.5 mainline versions but it still needs some work, we will keep an eye on it \[11\].

On the other hand, there is an issue with log rotate (this is not a bug). We noticed that, if you don’t change the root password, cron jobs don’t work and, among other things, logrotate doesn’t truncate syslog and the it gets full. So, in order to avoid this, you need to login twice to change both passwords. First, as ethereum user (default password: ethereum) and second as root user (default password: 1234).

**RASPBERRY PI 4**

We’ve been experiencing memory limitations on the Raspberry Pi 4 for quite a while now, mainly caused by the 32-bit OS \[8\]. While the Raspbian kernel is already using a 64bit kernel, the userland is still on 32bit so, in order to mitigate these problems as much as possible, we’ve ported the Armbian virtual RAM system to the Rpi4 \[12\] that leverages the ZRAM kernel module to improve memory performance and, additionally, raised the swap file to 6GB. All in all, eventual crashes may happen so take this into account.

At the same time, we are looking for alternatives to set up a full 64bit image. Firstly, to get rid of the memory problems and, secondly to allow the Raspberry Pi 4 to run Eth2 clients (currently Prysm and Lighthouse). We are looking into these 2 options:

Official Ubuntu Server image \[13\]: We tried the official Ubuntu Server 18.04.4 that includes the 5.4 mainline kernel. The good news here is that we haven't been able to reproduce the allocation memory problem. The bad news is that the disk performance is painfully slow so this doesn’t seem an option right now.

Unofficial Ubuntu Server image \[14\]: As described on a recent post \[15\], this images is a pure 64-bit OS but uses some Raspbian parts, including the 64-bit kernel and firmware. We will try the new image soon and post the results here.

Gitcoin

We set up a Gitcoin Grant for the project. If you appreciate our work and want to support the project, please make a donation. Remember that in Gitcon CLR rounds even 1$ can make the difference!. Thank you in advance.

I got into crypto this year and I've been investing lots. Mainly to HODL, as a place to store my personal wealth and all that. I believe in crypto ever since I got introduced and read up on all it's applications and what it could bring for the future.

However, I just completed my first transfer to someone across the world in exchange for goods and it feels amazing. I purchased something from somebody who's trying to live their dream and build a sustainable business, while being plagued by a currency that's under pressure and systems that are failing.

It was the first time they received payment in crypto for a product and they are over the moon. Not just me, but to them... they feel empowered and are elated that it works and that it frees them from all the rules, regulations and other needless protocols that are in place to make it hard on people trying to just make a living.

Fuck it, I'm in tears just because it made their day, it made my day and I'm about to received beautiful hand made products from across the world that have made with love and are payed for in crypto. Not a fucking bank in sight.

Doing business over blockchain would help shift crypto from being a highly volitile asset that most people only hold hoping for profit, to a store of value that is actually logical to exchange hands. 

I think adoption on the firm level must come before general population. There is no reason for 99.9% of people to have eth if they can't pay bills, shop online, or buy groceries with eth.

yorickdowne,0.0,116.0,"What is happening with the Medalla eth2 testnet currently, Oct 17th 2020? Here's an ELI5. (Not exactly 5. Maybe 10. You get the idea.)

&amp;#x200B;

1.  A bunch of validators turned off (maybe zinken, maybe bored, who knows)
2.  We entered non-finality. This means we don't have enough validators online to agree to what the state of the network is. We need 2/3rds.
3. Some sync bugs reared their heads, in Prysm and Nimbus. We lost more validators to the bugs, not everyone has updated since
4. Non-finality increases memory and CPU requirements, we likely lost more validators because their nodes couldn't handle it
5. Either people come back in and we regain finality or
6. They don't and offline validators lose eth faster and faster, until we regain finality. Some may be ejected if their balance falls too low.
7. You can stare at [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in) to see current participation rate. The rest of the site isn't keeping up
8. This would not go on this long on main net because people aren't just going to say ""meh"" while real eth burns
9. The network is working as designed for a major disruption scenario in which it needs to self-heal
10. I'm not sure we have a solid handle on when the network is back up if 6) comes to pass, but lower bound Oct 25th (ish), upper bound 5 days later
11. Anyone who is offline and doesn't want to come back on can help by doing an orderly exit, here's a tool to make it easy: [https://github.com/eth2-educators/medalla-exit](https://github.com/eth2-educators/medalla-exit)

= End of ELI10 =

In some more technical detail:

We entered non-finality October 12th in the morning US Eastern TZ. This happened after 4 consecutive epochs without consensus.

At this point, ""quadratic leaking"" kicks in. Offline validators are penalized in increasing amounts as non-finality continues. The formula for this is Penalty = EffectiveBalance \* Epochs-Since-Finality / (2\^25). For the math geeks: ""The penalty per epoch is linear with finality delay, which means the total penalty (integral of it) is quadratic"" (thank you torfbolt)

Inactive validators are not punished. A validator might be inactive because it is in activation queue, or its deposit hasn't even been processed yet - these will become active as we regain finality. A validator might also be inactive because it sent a voluntary exit, and it will not be punished.

Active and online validators stay at exactly +-0 if their inclusion distance is a perfect 1. That's impossible, so they are penalized slightly. djrtwo of the Ethereum Foundation has stated that they are looking at ways to safely reduce this penalty for validators ""doing their part"" because the penalty doesn't, in a nutshell, feel good.

Validators that are both active **and** offline are punished quadratically, that is, the penalty per epoch increases with each epoch.

A validator is marked offline for an epoch if it does not attest in an epoch. This can happen to otherwise running validators if their beacon node gets out of sync, or if they are unable to attest. Possible causes to look for are client bugs and RAM/CPU resource usage. Now is the time to learn how to build clients from source, and to check the sizing of your node ([https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/jcsvfc/8\_gib\_nodes\_some\_observations\_on\_how\_to\_fit\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/jcsvfc/8_gib_nodes_some_observations_on_how_to_fit_in/)).

Estimating the time when the chain regains finality is difficult because validator participation fluctuates, influenced by client bugs.

Validators are kicked out when their ""effective balance"" reaches 16 eth, which I believe happens at 16.75 actual eth.

Even before validators are kicked out, their decreasing balance means they lose weight in the consensus. I have seen an estimate that we might regain consensus after \~13 days. This gives us our lower bound: Oct 25th, or thereabouts. Some validators became active in August and never submitted a single attestation, those would accelerate this process.

It takes 18 days for a validator to be at \~60.6% of its balance, that gives us the upper bound.

After 3 consecutive epochs with consensus, finality will be restored. Offline penalties revert to their regular, less-punishing ""during finality"" defaults.

Dragonchain has demonstrated **twice Reddit’s entire total daily volume (votes, comments, and posts** [**per Reddit 2019 Year in Review**](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/)**)** in a [24-hour demo](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4) on an operational network.  Every single transaction on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with combined proof on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. At the time, in January 2020, the entire cost of the demo was approximately $25K on a single system (transaction fees locked at $0.0001/txn). With current fees (lowest fee $0.0000025/txn), this would cost as little as $625.

W**atch Joe walk through the entire proposal and answer questions on** [**YouTube**](https://youtu.be/RZHuqo_XOoQ)**.**

This proposal is also available on the [Dragonchain blog](https://dragonchain.com/blog/reddit-ethereum-blockchain-scalability).

## Hello Reddit and Ethereum community!

I’m Joe Roets, Founder &amp; CEO of Dragonchain. When the team and I first heard about The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off we were intrigued. We believe we have the solutions Reddit seeks for its community points system and we have them at scale.

For your consideration, we have submitted our proposal below. The team at Dragonchain and I welcome and look forward to your technical questions, philosophical feedback, and fair criticism, to build a scaling solution for Reddit that will empower its users. Because our architecture is unlike other blockchain platforms out there today, we expect to receive many questions while people try to grasp our project. I will  answer all questions here in this thread on Reddit, and I've answered some questions in the stream on YouTube.

We have seen good discussions so far in the competition. We hope that Reddit’s scaling solution will emerge from The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off and that Reddit will have great success with the implementation.

## Executive summary

Dragonchain is a robust open source hybrid blockchain platform that has proven to withstand the passing of time since our inception in 2014. We have continued to evolve to harness the scalability of private nodes, yet take full advantage of the security of public decentralized networks, like Ethereum. We have a live, operational, and fully functional Interchain network integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and \~700 independent Dragonchain nodes. Every transaction is secured to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Classic. Transactions are immediately usable on chain, and the first decentralization is seen within 20 seconds on Dragon Net. Security increases further to public networks ETH, BTC, and ETC within 10 minutes to 2 hours. Smart contracts can be written in any executable language, offering full freedom to existing developers. We invite any developer to watch the demo, play with our SDK’s, review open source code, and to help us move forward. Dragonchain specializes in scalable loyalty &amp; rewards solutions and has built a decentralized social network on chain, with very affordable transaction costs. This experience can be combined with the insights Reddit and the Ethereum community have gained in the past couple of months to roll out the solution at a rapid pace.

## Response and PoC

In *The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off* post, Reddit has asked for a series of demonstrations, requirements, and other considerations. In this section, we will attempt to answer all of these requests.

On Jan 7, 2020, Dragonchain hosted a 24-hour live demonstration during which a quarter of a billion (250 million+) transactions executed fully on an operational network. **Every single transaction** on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with **combined proof** on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. This means that every single transaction is secured by, and traceable to these networks. An attack on this system would require a simultaneous attack on all of the Interchained networks.

The demonstration was of a single business system, and any user is able to scale this further, by running multiple systems simultaneously. Our goals for the event were to demonstrate a consistent capacity greater than that of Visa over an extended time period.

## Scaling

&gt;How it works &amp; scales

## Architectural Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture attacks the scalability issue from multiple angles. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, wherein every transaction is protected on a business node to the requirements of that business or purpose. A business node may be held completely private or may be exposed or replicated to any level of exposure desired.

Every node has its own blockchain and is independently scalable. Dragonchain established *Context Based Verification* as its consensus model. Every transaction is immediately usable on a trust basis, and in time is provable to an increasing level of decentralized consensus. A transaction will have a level of decentralization to independently owned and deployed Dragonchain nodes (\~700 nodes) within seconds, and full decentralization to BTC and ETH within minutes or hours. Level 5 nodes (Interchain nodes) function to secure all transactions to public or otherwise external chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These nodes scale the system by aggregating multiple blocks into a single Interchain transaction on a cadence. This timing is configurable based upon average fees for each respective chain. For detailed information about Dragonchain’s architecture, and *Context Based Verification*, please refer to the [Dragonchain Architecture Document](https://dragonchain.com/Dragonchain-Architecture.pdf).

## Economic Scaling

An interesting feature of Dragonchain’s network consensus is its economics and scarcity model. Since Dragon Net nodes (L2-L4) are independent staking nodes, deployment to cloud platforms would allow any of these nodes to scale to take on a large percentage of the verification work. This is great for scalability, but not good for the economy, because there is no scarcity, and pricing would develop a downward spiral and result in fewer verification nodes. For this reason, Dragonchain uses TIME as scarcity.

TIME is calculated as the number of Dragons held, multiplied by the number of days held. TIME influences the user’s access to features within the Dragonchain ecosystem. It takes into account both the Dragon balance and length of time each Dragon is held. TIME is staked by users against every verification node and dictates how much of the transaction fees are awarded to each participating node for every block.

TIME also dictates the transaction fee itself for the business node. TIME is staked against a business node to set a **deterministic transaction fee** level (see transaction fee table below in Cost section). This is very interesting in a discussion about scaling because it guarantees independence for business implementation. No matter how much traffic appears on the entire network, a business is guaranteed to not see an increased transaction fee rate.

## Scaled Deployment

Dragonchain uses Docker and Kubernetes to allow the use of best practices traditional system scaling. Dragonchain offers *managed nodes* with an easy to use web based console interface. The user may also deploy a Dragonchain node within their own datacenter or favorite cloud platform. Users have deployed Dragonchain nodes on-prem on Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure, and other hosting platforms around the world. Any executable code, anything you can write, can be written into a smart contract. This flexibility is what allows us to say that developers with no blockchain experience can use any code language to access the benefits of blockchain. Customers have used NodeJS, Python, Java, and even BASH shell script to write smart contracts on Dragonchain.

With Docker containers, we achieve better separation of concerns, faster deployment, higher reliability, and lower response times.

We chose Kubernetes for its self-healing features, ability to run multiple services on one server, and its large and thriving development community. It is resilient, scalable, and automated. OpenFaaS allows us to package smart contracts as Docker images for easy deployment.

Contract deployment time is now bounded only by the size of the Docker image being deployed but remains fast even for reasonably large images. We also take advantage of Docker’s flexibility and its ability to support any language that can run on x86 architecture. Any image, public or private, can be run as a smart contract using Dragonchain.

## Flexibility in Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture considers interoperability and integration as key features. From inception, we had a goal to increase adoption via integration with real business use cases and traditional systems.

We envision the ability for Reddit, in the future, to be able to integrate alternate content storage platforms or other financial services along with the token.

* **LBRY** \- To allow users to deploy content natively to LBRY
* **MakerDAO** to allow users to lend small amounts backed by their Reddit community points.
* **STORJ/SIA** to allow decentralized on chain storage of portions of content. These integrations or any other are relatively easy to integrate on Dragonchain with an Interchain implementation.

## Cost

&gt;Cost estimates (on-chain and off-chain) For the purpose of this proposal, we assume that all transactions are on chain (posts, replies, and votes).

On the Dragonchain network, transaction costs are deterministic/predictable. By staking TIME on the business node (as described above) Reddit can reduce transaction costs to as low as $0.0000025 per transaction.

## Getting Started

&gt;How to run it

Building on Dragonchain is simple and requires no blockchain experience. Spin up a business node (L1) in our managed environment (AWS), run it in your own cloud environment, or on-prem in your own datacenter. Clear documentation will walk you through the steps of spinning up your first Dragonchain Level 1 Business node.

Getting started is easy...

1. Download Dragonchain’s dctl
2. Input three commands into a terminal
3. Build an image
4. Run it

More information can be found in our Get started documents.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Architecture

Dragonchain is an open source hybrid platform. Through Dragon Net, each chain combines the power of a public blockchain (like Ethereum) with the privacy of a private blockchain.

Dragonchain organizes its network into five separate levels. A Level 1, or business node, is a totally private blockchain only accessible through the use of public/private keypairs. All business logic, including smart contracts, can be executed on this node directly and added to the chain.

After creating a block, the Level 1 business node broadcasts a version stripped of sensitive private data to Dragon Net. Three Level 2 Validating nodes validate the transaction based on guidelines determined from the business. A Level 3 Diversity node checks that the level 2 nodes are from a diverse array of locations. A Level 4 Notary node, hosted by a KYC partner, then signs the validation record received from the Level 3 node. The transaction hash is ledgered to the Level 5 public chain to take advantage of the hash power of massive public networks.

Dragon Net can be thought of as a “blockchain of blockchains”, where every level is a complete private blockchain. Because an L1 can send to multiple nodes on a single level, proof of existence is distributed among many places in the network. Eventually, proof of existence reaches level 5 and is published on a public network.

## Nobody’s Perfect

&gt;Known issues or tradeoffs

* Dragonchain is open source and even though the platform is easy enough for developers to code in any language they are comfortable with, we do not have so large a developer community as Ethereum. We would like to see the Ethereum developer community (and any other communities) become familiar with our SDK’s, our solutions, and our platform, to unlock the full potential of our Ethereum Interchain. Long ago we decided to prioritize both Bitcoin and Ethereum Interchains. We envision an ecosystem that encompasses different projects to give developers the ability to take full advantage of all the opportunities blockchain offers to create decentralized solutions not only for Reddit but for all of our current platforms and systems. We believe that together we will take the adoption of blockchain further. We currently have additional Interchain with Ethereum Classic. We look forward to Interchain with other blockchains in the future. We invite all blockchains projects who believe in decentralization and security to Interchain with Dragonchain.
* While we only have 700 nodes compared to 8,000 Ethereum and 10,000 Bitcoin nodes. We harness those 18,000 nodes to scale to extremely high levels of security. See [Dragonchain metrics](https://metrics.dragonchain.com).
* Some may consider the centralization of Dragonchain’s business nodes as an issue at first glance, however, the model is by design to protect business data. We do not consider this a drawback as these nodes can make any, none, or all data public. Depending upon the implementation, **every subreddit could have control of its own business node**, for potential business and enterprise offerings, bringing **new alternative revenue streams to Reddit**.

## Costs and resources

&gt;Summary of cost &amp; resource information for both on-chain &amp; off-chain components used in the PoC, as well as cost &amp; resource estimates for further scaling. If your PoC is not on mainnet, make note of any mainnet caveats (such as congestion issues).

Every transaction on the PoC system had a transaction fee of $0.0001 (one-hundredth of a cent USD). At 256MM transactions, the demo cost $25,600. With current operational fees, the same demonstration would cost $640 USD.

For the demonstration, to achieve throughput to mimic a worldwide payments network, we modeled several clients in AWS and 4-5 business nodes to handle the traffic. The business nodes were tuned to handle higher throughput by adjusting memory and machine footprint on AWS. This flexibility is valuable to implementing a system such as envisioned by Reddit. Given that Reddit’s daily traffic (posts, replies, and votes) is less than half that of our demo, we would expect that the entire Reddit system could be handled on 2-5 business nodes using right-sized containers on AWS or similar environments.

Verification was accomplished on the operational Dragon Net network with over 700 independently owned verification nodes running around the world at no cost to the business other than paid transaction fees.

## Requirements

## Scaling

&gt;This PoC should scale to the numbers below with minimal costs (both on &amp; off-chain). There should also be a clear path to supporting hundreds of millions of users.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over a 5 day period, your scaling PoC should be able to handle:  
&gt;  
&gt;\*100,000 point claims (minting &amp; distributing points) \*25,000 subscriptions \*75,000 one-off points burning \*100,000 transfers

During Dragonchain’s 24 hour demo, the above required numbers were reached within the first few minutes.

Reddit’s total activity is 9000% more than Ethereum’s total transaction level. Even if you do not include votes, it is still 700% more than Ethereum’s current volume. Dragonchain has demonstrated that it can handle 250 million transactions a day, and it’s architecture allows for multiple systems to work at that level simultaneously. In our PoC, we demonstrate double the full capacity of Reddit, and every transaction was proven all the way to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

[Reddit Scaling on Ethereum](https://preview.redd.it/k9itp7es3td51.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c959bcb45321396857cc5e3e041d8b854cc065f)

## Decentralization

&gt;Solutions should not depend on any single third-party provider. We prefer solutions that do not depend on specific entities such as Reddit or another provider, and solutions with no single point of control or failure in off-chain components but recognize there are numerous trade-offs to consider

Dragonchain’s architecture calls for a hybrid approach. Private business nodes hold the sensitive data while the validation and verification of transactions for the business are decentralized within seconds and secured to public blockchains within 10 minutes to 2 hours. Nodes could potentially be controlled by owners of individual subreddits for more organic decentralization.

* Billing is currently centralized - there is a path to federation and decentralization of a scaled billing solution.
* Operational multi-cloud
* Operational on-premises capabilities
* Operational deployment to any datacenter
* Over 700 independent Community Verification Nodes with proof of ownership
* Operational Interchain (Interoperable to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic, open to more)

## Usability Scaling solutions should have a simple end user experience.

&gt;Users shouldn't have to maintain any extra state/proofs, regularly monitor activity, keep track of extra keys, or sign anything other than their normal transactions

Dragonchain and its customers have demonstrated extraordinary usability as a feature in many applications, where users do not need to know that the system is backed by a live blockchain. Lyceum is one of these examples, where the progress of academy courses is being tracked, and successful completion of courses is rewarded with certificates on chain. Our @Save\_The\_Tweet bot is popular on Twitter. When used with one of the following hashtags - #please, #blockchain, #ThankYou, or #eternalize the tweet is saved through Eternal to multiple blockchains. A proof report is available for future reference. Other examples in use are DEN, our decentralized social media platform, and our console, where users can track their node rewards, view their TIME, and operate a business node.

Examples:

* [Den social media](https://den.social)
* [Eternal &amp; Save The Tweet bot](https://twitter.com/save_the_tweet?s=21)
* [Lyceum/Academy](https://academy.dragonchain.org)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Transactions complete in a reasonable amount of time (seconds or minutes, not hours or days)

All transactions are **immediately usable** on chain by the system. A transaction begins the path to decentralization at the conclusion of a 5-second block when it gets distributed across 5 separate community run nodes. Full decentralization occurs within 10 minutes to 2 hours depending on which interchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ethereum Classic) the transaction hits first. Within approximately 2 hours, the combined hash power of all interchained blockchains secures the transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Free to use for end users (no gas fees, or fixed/minimal fees that Reddit can pay on their behalf)

With transaction pricing as low as $0.0000025 per transaction, it may be considered reasonable for Reddit to cover transaction fees for users.

[All of Reddit's Transactions on Blockchain \(month\)](https://preview.redd.it/p9tmb6i04td51.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6575e26f0e2f2d368123500d62d9a875efb3add1)

Community points can be earned by users and distributed directly to their Reddit account in batch (as per Reddit minting plan), and allow users to withdraw rewards to their Ethereum wallet whenever they wish. Withdrawal fees can be paid by either user or Reddit. This model has been operating inside the Dragonchain system since 2018, and many security and financial compliance features can be optionally added. We feel that this capability greatly enhances user experience because it is seamless to a regular user without cryptocurrency experience, yet flexible to a tech savvy user. With regard to currency or token transactions, these would occur on the Reddit network, verified to BTC and ETH. These transactions would incur the $0.0000025 transaction fee. To estimate this fee we use the monthly active Reddit users [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/443332/reddit-monthly-visitors/) with a 60% adoption rate and an estimated 10 transactions per month average resulting in an approximate $720 cost across the system. Reddit could feasibly incur all associated *internal* network charges (mining/minting, transfer, burn) as these are very low and controllable fees.

[Reddit Internal Token Transaction Fees](https://preview.redd.it/cbnnso9a4td51.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdcef7c919820dac4fc5b78fc8e68f5032126e35)

&amp;#x200B;

[Reddit Ethereum Token Transaction Fees](https://preview.redd.it/5vrfq1nf4td51.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed092be8b21e0df4bb60ca0832f5bdda7665e8d)

When we consider further the Ethereum fees that might be incurred, we have a few choices for a solution.

1. Offload all Ethereum transaction fees (user withdrawals) to interested users as they wish to withdraw tokens for external use or sale.
2. Cover Ethereum transaction fees by aggregating them on a timed schedule. Users would request withdrawal (from Reddit or individual subreddits), and they would be transacted on the Ethereum network every hour (or some other schedule).
3. In a combination of the above, customers could cover aggregated fees.
4. Integrate with alternate Ethereum roll up solutions or other proposals to aggregate minting and distribution transactions onto Ethereum.

## Bonus Points

&gt;Users should be able to view their balances &amp; transactions via a blockchain explorer-style interface

From interfaces for users who have no knowledge of blockchain technology to users who are well versed in blockchain terms such as those present in a typical block explorer, a system powered by Dragonchain has flexibility on how to provide balances and transaction data to users. Transactions can be made viewable in an Eternal Proof Report, which displays raw data along with TIME staking information and traceability all the way to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every other Interchained network. The report shows fields such as transaction ID, timestamp, block ID, multiple verifications, and Interchain proof. [See example here](https://eternal.dragonchain.com/transaction/c26fa966-1ae1-43d3-854b-5cf9c6ee0cd2).

Node payouts within the Dragonchain console are listed in chronological order and can be further seen in either Dragons or USD. [See example here](https://imgur.com/gallery/NbzS9bU).

In our social media platform, Dragon Den, users can see, in real-time, their NRG and MTR balances. [See example here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/580spr1)

A new influencer app powered by Dragonchain, Raiinmaker, breaks down data into a user friendly interface that shows coin portfolio, redeemed rewards, and social scores per campaign. [See example here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/7NdOSKu)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Exiting is fast &amp; simple

Withdrawing funds on Dragonchain’s console requires three clicks, however, withdrawal scenarios with more enhanced security features per Reddit’s discretion are obtainable.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Interoperability Compatibility with third party apps (wallets/contracts/etc) is necessary.

Proven interoperability at scale that surpasses the required specifications. Our entire platform consists of interoperable blockchains connected to each other and traditional systems. APIs are well documented. Third party permissions are possible with a simple smart contract without the end user being aware. No need to learn any specialized proprietary language. Any code base (not subsets) is usable within a Docker container. Interoperable with any blockchain or traditional APIs. We’ve witnessed relatively complex systems built by engineers with no blockchain or cryptocurrency experience. We’ve also demonstrated the creation of smart contracts within minutes built with BASH shell and Node.js. Please see our source code and API documentation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Scaling solutions should be extensible and allow third parties to build on top of it Open source and extensible  
&gt;  
&gt;APIs should be well documented and stable

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Third-party permissionless integrations should be possible &amp; straightforward Smart contracts are Docker based, can be written in any language, use full language (not subsets), and can therefore be integrated with any system including traditional system APIs. Simple is better. Learning an uncommon or proprietary language should not be necessary.

Advanced knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, or L2 scaling should not be required. Compatibility with common utilities &amp; toolchains is expected.

Dragonchain business nodes and smart contracts leverage Docker to allow the use of literally any language or executable code. No proprietary language is necessary. We’ve witnessed relatively complex systems built by engineers with no blockchain or cryptocurrency experience. We’ve also demonstrated the creation of smart contracts within minutes built with BASH shell and Node.js.

# Bonus

&gt;Bonus Points: Show us how it works. Do you have an idea for a cool new use case for Community Points? Build it!

## TIME

Community points could be awarded to Reddit users based upon TIME too, whereas the longer someone is part of a subreddit, the more community points someone naturally gained, even if not actively commenting or sharing new posts. A daily login could be required for these community points to be credited. This grants awards to readers too and incentivizes readers to create an account on Reddit if they browse the website often. This concept could also be leveraged to provide some level of reputation based upon duration and consistency of contribution to a community subreddit.

* [TIME](https://dragonchain.com/community/time)
* [Learn more about TIME and how to apply this to your nodes](https://dragonchain.com/blog/pooled-nodes-apply-time)

## Dragon Den

Dragonchain has already built a social media platform that harnesses community involvement. Dragon Den is a decentralized community built on the Dragonchain blockchain platform. Dragon Den is Dragonchain’s answer to fake news, trolling, and censorship. It incentivizes the creation and evaluation of quality content within communities. It could be described as being a shareholder of a subreddit or Reddit in its entirety. The more your subreddit is thriving, the more rewarding it will be. Den is currently in a public beta and in active development, though the real token economy is not live yet. There are different tokens for various purposes. Two tokens are Lair Ownership Rights (LOR) and Lair Ownership Tokens (LOT).  LOT is a non-fungible token for ownership of a specific Lair. LOT will only be created and converted from LOR.

Energy (NRG) and Matter (MTR) work jointly. Your MTR determines how much NRG you receive in a 24-hour period. Providing quality content, or evaluating content will earn MTR.

* [Den social media](https://den.social)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Security. Users have full ownership &amp; control of their points.

All community points awarded based upon any type of activity or gift, are secured and provable to all Interchain networks (currently BTC, ETH, ETC). Users are free to spend and withdraw their points as they please, depending on the features Reddit wants to bring into production.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Balances and transactions cannot be forged, manipulated, or blocked by Reddit or anyone else

Users can withdraw their balance to their ERC20 wallet, directly through Reddit. Reddit can cover the fees on their behalf, or the user covers this with a portion of their balance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Users should own their points and be able to get on-chain ERC20 tokens without permission from anyone else

Through our console users can withdraw their ERC20 rewards. This can be achieved on Reddit too. Here is a walkthrough of our console, though this does not show the quick withdrawal functionality, a user can withdraw at any time. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNlTMxnfVHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNlTMxnfVHw)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Points should be recoverable to on-chain ERC20 tokens even if all third-parties involved go offline

If necessary, signed transactions from the Reddit system (e.g. Reddit + Subreddit) can be sent to the Ethereum smart contract for minting.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A public, third-party review attesting to the soundness of the design should be available

To our knowledge, at least two large corporations, including a top 3 accounting firm, have conducted positive reviews. These reviews have never been made public, as Dragonchain did not pay or contract for these studies to be released.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Bonus points  
&gt;  
&gt;Public, third-party implementation review available or in progress

See above

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Compatibility with HSMs &amp; hardware wallets

For the purpose of this proposal, all tokenization would be on the Ethereum network using standard token contracts and as such, would be able to leverage all hardware wallet and Ethereum ecosystem services.

## Other Considerations

&gt;Minting/distributing tokens is not performed by Reddit directly

This operation can be automated by smart contract on Ethereum. Subreddits can if desired have a role to play.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;One off point burning, as well as recurring, non-interactive point burning (for subreddit memberships) should be possible and scalable

This is possible and scalable with interaction between Dragonchain Reddit system and Ethereum token contract(s).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fully open-source solutions are strongly preferred

Dragonchain is fully open source (see section on Disney release after conclusion).

## Conclusion

Whether it is today, or in the future, we would like to work together to bring secure flexibility to the highest standards. It is our hope to be considered by Ethereum, Reddit, and other integrative solutions so we may further discuss the possibilities of implementation. In our public demonstration, 256 million transactions were handled in our operational network on chain in 24 hours, for the low cost of $25K, which if run today would cost $625. Dragonchain’s interoperable foundation provides the atmosphere necessary to implement a frictionless community points system. Thank you for your consideration of our proposal. We look forward to working with the community to make something great!

## Disney Releases Blockchain Platform as Open Source

The team at Disney created the Disney Private Blockchain Platform. The system was a hybrid interoperable blockchain platform for ledgering and smart contract development geared toward solving problems with blockchain adoption and usability. All objective evaluation would consider the team’s output a success. We released a list of use cases that we explored in some capacity at Disney, and our input on blockchain standardization as part of our participation in the W3C Blockchain Community Group.

On top of meeting the above criteria, as part of the process, the maintainer of the project had to receive the codebase on their own personal email and create accounts for maintenance (e.g. Github) with non-Disney accounts. Given the fact that the project spanned multiple business units, Roets was individually responsible for its ongoing maintenance. Because of this, he proposed in the open source application to create a non-profit organization to hold the IP and maintain the project. This was approved by Disney.

The Disney Open Source Committee approved the application known as OSSRELEASE-10, and the code was released on October 2, 2016. Disney decided to not issue a press release.

bitbuggs,0.0,111.0,"Those living in America or other first world countries often times have a hard time understanding the impact Ethereum and other decentralized tech will have. Although this tech will have a lot of innovation in first world countries, many people might not understand the impact Ethereum (and other blockchains) will have in emerging and under developed markets. 

The lack of infrastructure is currently one of the biggest disadvantages that underdeveloped countries have. This lack of infrastructure is also what will make these same underdeveloped and emerging market economies very advanced in the future. With the fast innovation of technology it is starting to make society less and less reliant on the built out infrastructure that we currently have. Cell phones now make telephone poles unneeded, solar panels can allow people to live without being connected to the grid, the internet allows people to work from home and not a corporate building, and blockchain allows for people to have financial tools on their devices instead of a bank.

In America, we are starting to lag behind in certain tech changes (such as renewable energy) partly because we are too reliant on the tech of the past. In order for America to receive the full benefits of the tech that is becoming available, they will need to first break down the current system we have and restructure everything to more modernized technology. A perfect example of this is the power grid. With the changes happening in energy, America will need to restructure the entire grid to make it more efficient to meet our future power demand needs and to decrease pollution from energy. The same can be said about blockchain. Other countries will surpass America in blockchain use because of our reliance on traditional financial markets. 

When it comes to blockchain, I believe this will be a HUGE benefit to emerging and under developed societies. This is because it will allow these societies to have access to financial systems. There are countless communities in other countries where the citizens have no access to financial markets because there are no banks for miles. With nothing more than a cell phone and internet access, these emerging market will have access to currencies that are accepted worldwide, which allows them to trade with others. Having access to defi will allow these societies to pool their money together to earn an extra 5% on their money, which is a lot for many people across the world. This access to a monetary system and access to trade will be the first step in the growth of these underdeveloped markets. Other technologies such as solar will also have a big impact on these societies because it will give everyone, no matter where they are, access to power. With money and access to power, it will allow these societies to build their land to be adapted to the modernized tech of the world, there will be no old infrastructure to tear down first. 

Although it will take decades for these under developed societies to catch up with modern societies, the opportunity that they have to even catch up to economies such as America is huge. And considering how fast tech moves, once other countries have caught up to developed nations, they will have the opportunity to pass these large developed countries in productivity. 

50 years ago no one would have thought that China would come close to surpassing America in production. Tech made that possible. Today some people think that underdeveloped nations in Africa or Asia will never be able to advance at a rate quick enough to compete with America or China.

[Celer](http://celer.network/) is a layer-2 scaling platform pioneering the technology of [state channel network](https://www.celer.network/docs/celercore/) and [hybrid roll-up](https://medium.com/celer-network/adding-hybrid-pos-rollup-sidechain-to-celers-coherent-layer-2-platform-d1d3067fe593). Ethereum is our home and we have a proven track record to contribute to its scalability. We propose Celer’s State Channel solution as a great fit for Reddit’s Community Points because:

* **It fits the ask with the right tradeoffs**: Apps built using Celer have **almost the exact same usage pattern like the Community Point**. In addition, we believe for Reddit’s specific use cases, State Channel Network provides the right tradeoffs in a complex layer-2 space. 
* **It is built for and battle-tested in the production environment**: these apps, such as [Arcade Win](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcade-win-play-for-cash/id1459895768), [Daub Cash](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daub-cash/id1513396754), [Solitaire Win](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solitaire-win/id1495854252), [Bust-A-Move RMT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bust-a-move-rmt/id1521498538) have close to 1 million users from 85 different countries for close to a year\*\*.\*\*
* **UX is priority #1**: newly onboarded users are using Celer layer-2 on Ethereum with the milli-second level UI interaction response and they are happy to rate UX [**4.5+ stars in App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcade-win-play-for-cash/id1459895768) without feeling any “blockchain slowness”**.**

In the following sections, we talk about how we already have in-production uses cases that are almost identical to Reddit’s requirements, why we believe state channel offers the right tradeoffs for the use cases and how we exceed the performance benchmarks by running at 4000 transactions per second and 9ms per transaction latency with just a single state channel node. Finally, we also discuss the concept of Layer-2 LEGO to have multiple different layer-2 techniques working together to address all current and future use cases in a coherent way.

## Use Cases Walkthrough

In this section, we walk through four use cases specified in the challenge: mint &amp; distribute Community Points (CP), CP transfer, auto subscription and CP burn. For each, we discuss the user flow of how apps are doing it today and underlying technical solutions when using state channels. For more general explanations of how state channels work, check out [generalized state channel walkthrough article](https://medium.com/celer-network/celer-network-cchannel-part-1-generalized-state-channel-walkthrough-20a87b390335), and more technically, the [specification](https://www.celer.network/docs/celercore/channel/overview.html), [detailed walkthrough](https://medium.com/celer-network/celer-state-channel-full-specification-and-design-principles-walkthrough-64db4659ee93) and [our Devcon V talk ](https://youtu.be/PvspyZjFeGs?t=4706).

## 💰Mint and Distribute Community Points

Celer supports this **exact use case** in CelerX gaming platform today. CelerX is a moible eSport platform where  users can pay ETH or supported ERC-20s to enter skill-based real money game tournaments and win prizes. 

[The onboarding process and token claim process are recorded in real-time](https://reddit.com/link/i2hx80/video/1e7diz8jzme51/player)

When a user onboards a game, he will be automatically created an Ethereum wallet. At the same time, 100 Game Token (ERC-20 used for free practice tournaments) will be **minted and distributed** to this user through Celer’s State Channel Network. When users use up all Game Tokens, new Game Tokens can be redeemed. Different game developers can use CelerX SDK to have different GT in their ecosystems.

**How much is it actually used today in production?** Our active users perform about 30K Game Token mint&amp;distribute per day and we are comfortably handling 150K such operations in the 5 day period mentioned by Reddit team. However, this is far from the actual limit of the software. Performance benchmarks are in the next section. 

It is straightforward to swap the “Game Token” to “Community Point” and different “game developers” to “subreddits” in the above description. It’s frictionless for users and indeed, 90% of our users do not even realize that they are using blockchain and only think we use an *interesting way* to back up their accounts (use iCloud or write down 12 words somewhere).

Next, we dig deeper into some specific aspects of the solution in an FAQ style. 

**Isn’t the case that a user has to have on-chain ETH to open a channel for Community Points?** Not really. Celer’s state channel network has a built-in functionality called [promised channel open](https://github.com/celer-network/goCeler-oss/blob/master/client/api.go#L97). This gives the possibility to have a **mutually signed commitment** between Off-chain Service Providers and users (Reddit or subreddit owners) to act as a promise to mint and distribute a certain amount of tokens to a user’s channel on layer-1. Therefore, it acts as a token mint in layer-2. 

**Does this mean that users have to store additional states or may lose their Community Points?** Luckily no. Users and service providers (e.g. Reddit or subreddit owners) can store their states in [State Guardian Network](https://www.celer.network/docs/celercore/sgn/availability.html) (SGN) by paying a fee. State Guardian Network is a decentralized watchtower solution that solves many of the state availability issues in traditional simple payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. 

**If a user is offline, will his CPs be exposed to attacks?** Nope again. This is what SGN is built for so that even when the user is offline, a decentralized SGN looks out for the user’s state. Other layer-2 solutions like Plasma or Rollups also have to have similar “watchtower” to monitor layer-2 state commits and transactions on users’ behalf and the involved cost in the worst-case malicious scenario is very similar.

In the state channel networks, users need to connect to some channel nodes in the network. **So who acts as a user’s counterparty node?** This will be the subreddit owner or Reddit itself in the beginning. This offers great horizontal scalability: each subreddit can host a cluster of state channel nodes in an **independently scalable fashion with strong user proximity** and connect to other subreddits in the channel network if common community points can be used cross certain subreddits. 

## 💸Community Points Transfer

[Game Token transfer experience](https://reddit.com/link/i2hx80/video/ukxgsb6rzme51/player)

P2P token transfer is really the bread and butter of the state channel network. To show a use case that is in production: when two users in CelerX platform enter a 1v1 match between each other, what happens underlying is that they send a layer-2 *boolean* *conditional* payment to each other *conditionally depending* on the result of the game. This condition will resolve to true or false and the corresponding layer-2 payment will be *established* or *canceled* automatically off-chain after the result of the game is determined off-chain. The conditional payment is a particularly powerful construct of generalized state channel network and we will discuss more in the subscription use case. Simple CP transfer completes across the network with 1.5 Round Trip Time (RTT) **end-to-end network latency in the order of milliseconds**. 

[Envisioned State Channel Network for Reddit Community Points](https://preview.redd.it/j7algz7tzme51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c6431ce47548f61ba9c1aaf7656413fe6061386)

**Does the recipient need to be online to receive the payment?** Not necessary. Celer’s state channel network has the unique capability to set [Delegated Recipients](https://github.com/celer-network/goCeler-oss/blob/master/client/celer_client.go#L322) to receive payment when a user is offline. The delegated recipients, in this case, can trivially be the subreddit hosts or Reddit itself in the very beginning. It is also important to note that Delegated Recipients can only sign state proof on users’ behalf and cannot actually withdraw the fund from the channel on-chain. In addition, to ensure that there is no possibility to have any state availability attack, the sender’s protocol ensures that the delegate put these mutually signed states to SGN so that when a user comes back online, he can retrieve the most recent state. 

**How much is it used today in production?** We are processing about 80K game payments in Game Token per day. Same as before, this is far from the system limit. Benchmarks will be discussed later.

## 🔥Community Points Burn

[Recording of Loyalty Point burn in CelerX platform](https://reddit.com/link/i2hx80/video/k961hvyu0ne51/player)

Community Points Burn is also a use case that we already implemented in production. In games built using Celer, there is a concept of Loyalty Point (ERC-20, like Game Token). Users receive Loyalty Points by competing in tournaments. Users can also use loyalty points to redeem items of real value (like Celer T-shirt). This redeeming process is precisely the token burn use case required by Reddit. 

This is implemented by simply sending the token back to the layer-2 minter. In our case, it is sent back to the game developers’ Celer nodes and in the case of Reddit, it will be sent back to the subreddit owners’ nodes.

**But wait,  how is the token burnt if it is** ***sent back*** **to the minter on layer-2?** In other words, would it be possible for a minter to just withdraw these tokens on-chain and send it to whoever he likes? Rest Assured. For the case of minted Community Points, the minter can act as counterparty to send out and relay points transfers, however, he is just a ***delegate recipient (see above discussion)*** of a  token minting pool address. The best he can try on-chain is to withdraw the token back to the pool but cannot actually get a hold of token on-chain. 

## 📅 Subscription Auto Payment

This is not yet live in production, but we actually have a feature coming up that uses the exact same usage pattern. To implement this use case, we use a powerful primitive of generalized state channel called **Conditional Payment.** To explain what a conditional payment is, let’s look at an example. When Alice sends a conditional payment with X CP to a subreddit CP minter the X CP won’t be immediately burnt but is in a “committed” state with a **conditional dependency that will be resolved later.** The condition can be literally anything that you can verify and get result on-chain, for example, subscription states of this subreddit and the timestamp. The final amount that Alice burnt can fall in the range between 0 to X and is determined by evaluating the outcome of the conditional dependency using any arbitrary function. In this very concrete use case, Alice can send a relatively large amount of CP as conditional payment and the resolution of the conditional payment will automatically update as the time passes by. Note that this process does not need to have any other layer-1 or layer-2 interaction so that is purely automatic. 

Sending a payment that conditionally depends on the outcome of an on-chain verifiable state (off-chain or on-chain) is equivalent to sending funds to a smart contract application in layer-1 and this is one of the **key differences between Celer generalized state channel solution and other simple payment channel network solutions.** 

## Why State Channel Network Provides the Right Tradeoffs for Reddit’s Use Cases?

With so many different great layer-2 solutions, identifying a fitting solution is about identifying the right tradeoff for the specific use cases. Celer as a platform contains different techniques like State Channel Network and Hybrid Rollup to cover the entire layer-2 tradeoff space. We previously discussed [different solutions’ tradeoffs](https://medium.com/celer-network/adding-hybrid-pos-rollup-sidechain-to-celers-coherent-layer-2-platform-d1d3067fe593). After applying these general principles to this specific case, we choose to not go to the Celer rollup solution and believe that Celer’s State Channel offer is the best fit.

Reddit’s use cases primarily concern token movement-related operations with certain flexibility requirements and it seems from the current requirements, things like “Defi + complicated yield mining based on Community Token” are not in the scope yet. Even when more complex use cases do come into the picture, it is still helpful to have a highly performant, low-cost, and flexible enough token operation core. 

In this section, we take a first-principle approach to **analyze the** **asymptotic** **fundamentals instead of fixated on a galaxy of possible system-level optimizations**. We believe State Channel Network offers the following fundamental advantages comparing to other layer-2 scaling techniques for Reddit’s specific use cases.

## ⚡️Web 2.0-like interactiveness via 100X lower latency

[Generalized Conditional Payment protocol sequence with 2RTT latency](https://preview.redd.it/on8kn2l90ne51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c042e7760314b396f7e5160c93f647387a91246)

Real-time and interactive UX is **not optional** in today’s consumer application world. Today’s Internet applications optimize latency to the[ level of milliseconds](https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-spring-2017-state-of-online-retail-performance-report.jsp) with well-studied results such as every additional 100ms latency on page load can drop [Amazon sales by 1%. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2016/11/10/why-brands-are-fighting-over-milliseconds/)

When Community Token is widely used, we would imagine it is on a lot of users’ critical interaction paths. However, layer-2 techniques such as Plasma, zk Rollup, and Optimistic Rollup (collectively *commit chains*), though good for throughput (high TPS), fail when tested against this latency requirement. Let’s have a break down for commit chains’ thick latency profile:

* Internet latency to send out transactions to gateway/block producer. This is in the milliseconds. 
* The latency for block producer to pack up a block with a batch of transactions. This is often in the seconds if not tens of seconds to control the layer-1 cost. However, for zk-Rollup this seems to be significantly longer due to proof computing. 
* The latency for the layer-1 blockchain to confirm the rollup block. This is in the tens of seconds if not minutes. 
* For non-zk rollups and Plasma, the actual finality latency (one can be sure that a transaction actually happened) is on the scale of hours to days. 

Even not accounting for the finality latency, that is if a client is “heavy” enough to store, compute and verify the additional state transitions themselves (which breaks the challenge’s requirements), the latency for a transaction to reach layer-1-level security is in the tens of seconds and easily minutes under layer-1 congestion. 

State Channel Network, however, offers **two orders of magnitudes lower latency** and gives users smoothest experience. The underlying reason for that is the so-called “instant finality”. When a user sends out a transaction in State Channel Network, all latency involved is a 1.5–3 Round Trip Time (worst-case in hundreds of milliseconds) to the counterparty to receive the mutually signed and updated state proof. Once this proof is obtained, this transaction is “final” as in there is no possibility to *revert or reorg* this transaction. We want to highlight that this is not a system engineering difference, but an **asymptotic advantage** for State Channel solutions. 

## 💪Simple horizontal throughput scalability with maximal decentralization

[Horizontal scaling by simply adding more subreddit nodes](https://i.redd.it/4w64ezp61ne51.gif)

In terms of throughput requirements, Celer’s State Channel also offers fundamental advantages. The key difference here is that State Channel Network offers a simple scale-out solution for the Reddit Community Point use cases. To add more subreddits supporting community tokens and therefore more users, it is as simple as spinning-up new Celer State Channel nodes. Each node will serve users in the “proximity” and cross different subreddits if tokens can be shared, they can be connected simply via some “backbone” links as a single and interoperable network. This offers **close to linear** scaling-out capacity as the number of users grows. **There will be no layer-2 or layer-1 congestion.** 

On the contrary, all layer-2 commit chain approaches (e.g. Plasma, zk Rollup, and Optimistic Rollup) rely on a **logical singleton** to order transaction, compute state transition and finally batch succinct transaction summaries (proof or state root+calldata) to the layer-1 blockchain. This means that as more and more users onboard the logical singleton, there will be even congestion on layer-2 let alone the inherent congestion on layer-1. To alleviate such congestion, a simple approach is to split one commit chain into multiple commit chains in the fashion similar to layer-1 sharding. However, cross-chain communication will then pose a significant challenge with much more complicated interaction beyond the acceptable requirement of the use case. 

## 💵 Lower transaction cost

State Channel also offers fundamentally lower transaction cost comparing to other layer-2 scaling solutions. 

First, on the storage side, the amount of storage required in State Channel system is linear to the number of users in the system and has nothing to do with the number of transactions or interactions. In addition, there is no layer-1 storage required during the transaction process (send CP and burn CP). This is because state channel nodes and SGN only need to store the latest state for each node instead of the full transaction history. On the contrary, the commit-chain approaches require storage capacity to scale up with the number of transactions. What’s worse, even when transactions are happening purely in layer-2, layer-1 storage resources are also consumed to store the validity proof or state root. 

Second, on the compute side, state channel requires less compute resources for off-chain transactions due to the fact that no state update needs to be computed or checked by a duplicated set of parties or waiting for any blocks. State updates are only computed and agreed upon between counterparties.

## 📝Flexible conditional payment primitive 

State Channel like any other layer-2 technique, does not cover the full spectrum of tradeoff plane. The biggest tradeoff is that it is trading off performance and cost with the supported application patterns. If it is a use case such as minting and transferring NFT tokens (e.g. CryptoKitty)where the involved users concurrently interacting in a session is arbitrary and changing at any given time with arbitrarily unique assets, State Channel is not the best solution. 

However, we do believe with Reddit’s specific use cases concentrating on token management and transfer, State Channel Network is a great fit with enough flexibility to go beyond just simple token transfers. Celer’s generalized state channel differs from simple payment channel networks (such as Raiden and Lightning) in the sense that it supports conditional payment to implement much more flexible functionalities and logics such as auto subscription with an underlying **generalized** payment network. 

## Performance Benchmarks

[Celer Network’s node software](https://github.com/celer-network/goCeler-oss) is highly optimized and **production-grade:** it requires less than 10MB minimal memory and can support 1,000 clients on one t2.micro instance with 1CPU, 1G memory\*\*.\*\* The node software is also hyper scalable with support of [multi-node clustering](https://github.com/celer-network/goCeler-oss/blob/master/cnode/multiserver.go) via solutions like k8s and [parallel database backend via solutions like Cockroach DB](https://github.com/celer-network/goCeler-oss#requirements). 

All of the use cases mentioned in Reddit Bakeoff essentially can reduce to token transfer operations. So we focus our test on this specific benchmark. As we discussed previously Celer’s state channel can scale horizontally, we use a single-node setup with a single database backend instance for the ease of reproducing the benchmarking results through our [end-to-end test](https://github.com/celer-network/goCeler-oss/tree/master/test/e2e).

[The video of the benchmark demo can be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpFNQ3HpZKg)

As shown in the performance benchmark demo, with this setup, Celer Node can achieve 4177 transactions per second and an average transaction latency of 9ms with a peak memory usage of less than 200MB. We want to note that our node software has the capability to extend a single node to a decentralized cluster of nodes plus a parallel database access backend. Celer Node software can achieve more than 30,000 transactions per second with 11ms latency per transaction on a single logical node built by a 9-server cluster. 

In terms of transaction cost, the only protocol cost is on storing user’s state to State Guardian Network. Each user’s state proof is around 200Bytes no matter how many transactions a user sends as the state constantly gets updated to the newest state instead of appending new states. Therefore, it is just a subscription model for a storage slot on the State Guardian Network. The pricing of state storage is dynamic and as of the initial launch of the SGN, the cost for processing the entire batch of challenge transactions and storing states during these time would be around $1.9.

## Notes on the “Layer-2 LEGO”

[Layer-2 tradeoffs](https://preview.redd.it/6ta4cb592ne51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba66439b4f0b34b4758cd43eba16ff9ba42f69b7)

Layer-2 is a complex space but it is also a composable one. We believe the best solution is not to choose any single layer-2 scaling technique but compose multiple techniques together as a wholistic solution. Analyzing the Reddit team’s requirements, we believe a combination of solutions working together might offer the best tradeoff for all current and future envisioned use cases. We provide an interesting thought experiment on how to compose different techniques together.

State Channel has the capability to not only run on layer-1 blockchains but also run on layer-2 commit chains like optimistic rollups. Therefore, we can imagine a system where the entire “on-chain” operations (e.g. exit of state channel and actual instantiation of channels) are all based on layer-2 smart contracts on optimistic rollup chains. This gives the flexibility to build very complex use cases like Community Token liquidity pool on rollups. At the same time, when it comes to real-time interaction, token distribution and token transfer, state channel network operating on top of a layer-2 rollup chain will take the load and give end-users the smoothest user experience possible. 

We believe this should be an exciting future for Layer-2 scaling on Ethereum.",ethereum,"Celer Joins Reddit Great Scaling Bakeoff: Exactly Matching Use Cases, in Production with Happy Users",105.0,0.86

I have a few missing pieces in a Ethereum 2.0. As far as i know ongoing phase is just for validators. Meaning that if you send ETH to new version of blockchain you got to lock them in your validator node for staking and this will take some time.   
My question is when will you be able to unlock ETH 2.0 and actually do something with it (meaning transactions).   
My second questions is for smart contracts on ETH 2.0. I understand that in phase 0 there will be no smart contracts. So i guessed that in phase 1 (sharding) smart contract funcionality will be implemented right ?   
Recently i ve read piece from Vitalik that Phase 2.0 might never come and i used to think that Phase 2 is a new implementation of smart contracts funcionality - so i am bit confused and would very much appreciate any information on the topic.

Two friends and I have finished our first DApp, called *Contributor Credits* ([www.contributorcredits.com](https://www.contributorcredits.com)). 

The idea is to give (hobby / side) projects a way of giving stake in their success without jumping through the legal hurdles of issuing equity (or even founding an entity). Contributor credits makes it very easy to create a new token so project owners can pay their contributors with a promise of future payment (if the venture is successful).

Optionally, these tokens can be partially funded (by a backing stable coin). Once an agreed upon trigger is reached (investment or yearly revenue for example) the issuing party is required to fully fund the Contributor credits (i.e. match the issued tokens with the backing stable coin).

The project is very much MVP stage, but if you guys want to give it a spin on Ropsten we would be very glad to get some feedback! The source code of the smart contract can be found here: [https://github.com/sunshine-labs/cc-smart-contract](https://github.com/sunshine-labs/cc-smart-contract) (any feedback here is also very welcome)

However, **some of these changes are backwards-incompatible, in that they may break existing applications or render them uneconomical**.

In all cases, these incompatibilities affect only a small portion of use cases, and there are alternative ways to get the same functionality, but nevertheless it's important to talk about these proposals early, so that developers have as much of a heads up as possible, and so that we have as much time as possible to refine the proposals to minimize disruption.

**After the merge** and the other important changes that are already in the roadmap today are complete, **I continue to think that it would be valuable for the Ethereum protocol to ""ossify""**, changing much less going forward so as to maximize developers' feeling of stability and ability to rely on protocol features. However, such an ossification is best done *after* we take into account our learnings from the past 6 years and make this one last push to make some major improvements to Ethereum.

This is my attempt at a partial listing of some changes that may happen.

See also: [this doc](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing), though the actual changes proposed there only cover the EVM, and this post is broader.

## History storage changes

* After the Ethereum application state is moved over to the beacon chain as part of **the merge**, we may want to discard the ethereum PoW chain, and no longer support any transaction or history queries going back into the PoW chain. **This greatly simplifies clients, as they can simply forget all the pre-merge protocol rules** and thus have a smaller and leaner codebase going forward, but it does mean that dapps that rely on looking back into history need to find some other way to do so.
* Even outside of the context of the merge, **we likely want to move toward a model where ""the network"" is only expected to be responsible for the most recent 1 year of history (including txs/blocks/receipts)**. This prevents clients from incurring ever-growing storage burdens, but it does once again mean that dapps that require old history will need an alternative way to get it.

## Statelessness / state expiry

See [my other post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lw7ug3/weak_statelessness_andor_state_expiry_coming_soon/).

State expiry is definitely likely to be the one change in this list that requires the most significant changes for contracts; contracts that do not change probably will not *break* (as the most recent state expiry schemes ensure that if you can find a witness, you can continue using existing contracts as is for as long as you want), but developers *will* likely need to build new versions of contracts to remain gas-efficient.

## EVM changes

* [**EIP 2929**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929) **(going into the upcoming Berlin hard fork)**, changing how SLOAD and calls/account accesses are priced. The first time an account or storage slot is accessed is now about 3x more expensive, but subsequent accesses are around 5-10x cheaper. On average, this only increases gas costs paid by users by \~0.3%, but it significantly improves the chain's DoS resistance and bounds on witness size.
* **Gas repricing for code witness size**: when we add code Merklization, to finish the job of bounding witness size we will need to charge some cost per chunk of code accessed in a transaction (eg. 400 gas per 32 byte chunk accessed). In general, this would somewhat increase the gas cost of ""simpler"" transactions (eg. an ERC20 approval accessed about 16 chunks so about 6.4k gas would be added) but it would only negligibly affect more complex transactions that loop over the same code many times. Gas limits can be adjusted upwards so that on average scalability remains the same as it was before, but even still, some applications may need to be rewritten to remain economical.
* **Removal or neutering of SELFDESTRUCT**: see [this whole document](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/selfdestruct) for the rationale.
* [**Removal of refunds**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3298) (proposed for the London hard fork), or limiting how refunds work, with the main goals of reducing block gas usage variance and freeing up blockchain space and storage being used by gastoken contracts.
* [**Removal of the 2300 gas stipend**](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing#The-2300-gas-stipend): a simplification to the protocol, removing a hard-coded value and hence making future gas cost changes more feasible
* **Replacing some precompiles with EVM code implementations**: this could be done mainly to simplify the protocol and the client code complexity, but it would inevitably come with gas cost changes.

## Miscellaneous

* **Ethereum is switching from RLP + hexary Patricia trees to SSZ and possibly Verkle trees**. This means that contracts that verify Merkle proofs into history will stop working at some point and will need to be rewritten. To allow developers to make Merkle proofs going forward, one possible route is to make an explicit ""history/state proof verification precompile"", so that whenever the state structure changes the precompile can change too, but of course this has not yet been implemented.
* **Block hashes will no longer be a good source of randomness** after the merge.
* The `DIFFICULTY` opcode will be useless after the merge (duh)
* **In the long run, quantum computers will break ECDSA and BLS**, and so everything that uses ECDSA or BLS will have to switch, and even ethereum 2.0 itself will have to move from BLS to a post-quantum aggregable signature scheme. **Fortunately, there has been a lot of work done recently by Starkware and others on making such schemes more efficient**, so we are very confident that we will survive the transition; but contract developers should necessarily be aware that this will happen.

There are likely items that I have missed, but this covers at least some of the important things that are worth watching out for. I highly encourage application developers and others to participate in this process and do so early, so that the protocol changes that end up happening can be done in a way that is as minimally disruptive as possible.",ethereum,Expectations for backwards-incompatible changes / removal of features that may come soon,107.0,0.99

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a long, long LONG time since we had a bit of a makeover here on r/ethereum. Fun fact (as pointed out on twitter): [the block number featured in the current header](https://twitter.com/_czepluch/status/1346235878449029122?s=19) reflects the date of 7 Aug, 2015.  That said, this thing has probably seen enough blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

A suggestion was made after a mod discussion to call for submissions and ethereum-related art to use in the header spot! Now, rather than making a contest out of it, we'd like to just do a better job to more regularly spruce up the place using some of what comes in if that sounds alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, anything that's free or open source is fair game. Whether it's a copy of an NFT that you own, the graphics from industry teams or [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org), your old posts from r/EthereumArtists or more -- feel free to throw them in below!

Tricky_Troll,0.0,95.0,"In this post I will outline the upgrade coming called ETH 2.0 and its different phases. I will try my best to explain it all in simple terms which even a beginner can understand (at least that’s the plan!).

#What’s Changing With ETH 2.0?

1. **Sharding:** Sharding will upgrade the existing Ethereum blockchain (which you can imagine as a one lane road) to a blockchain made of 64 parallel parts, known as shards. Think of these 64 shards as a 64 lane highway, each lane has the same capacity as the original single lane road which is Ethereum 1.0.

2. **Proof of Stake:** Ethereum 2.0 will move Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake. In a nutshell, proof of work is a system where people have to essentially waste electricity, proving they have done work and put effort/money into securing the blockchain. This makes it hard for one person to overtake the network because it would be extremely expensive to burn all that power. Proof of stake requires people who secure the network or ""validators"" to put up ETH as collateral as a ""stake"" in the network. If they help secure the network, they will earn ETH but if they act maliciously they can be penalised in the form of losing some of their staked ETH (known as slashing). Much like proof of work, proof of stake makes it hard for one person to overtake the network because they would need to buy a very large number of ETH, making the attack unrealistically expensive.

There are many pros and cons to proof of stake vs proof of work but Ethereum's implementation of proof of stake will make Ethereum more secure, more efficient and environmentally friendly (by using less power) and it will result in less inflation since the people securing the network don't need to be compensated monetarily for the electricity they used to secure the network.

#ETH 2.0 Phases

**ETH 2.0 is rolling out in multiple phases. These are:**

* **Phase 0:** This is the introduction of Proof of Stake and the creation of the ETH 2.0 blockchain. This is the backbone of the ETH 2.0 system. Imagine it like the foundation upon which the 64 lane road is being built. It is a wide flat foundation of rock and it is not connected to the existing Ethereum 1 road. While there are no cars driving on this chain yet (there are no transactions on this chain), people are able to move from the Ethereum 1 road and onto this new road. The people moving over are security guards making sure that the foundation of the road remains secure and ready for upgrading once the developers are ready to build out the rest of the road.

* *This is what the deposit contract and staking talk right now is about, you can move your 32 ETH in the deposit contract which will move your 32 ETH to the foundation of the ETH 2.0 road (known as the beacon chain) where you can stake your ETH and keep the road secure and ready for a future upgrade. In return these people get paid out a variable % interest on their 32 ETH for their service.*

* **Phase 1:** This is construction of 63 of the lanes on the new road. However, these lanes aren't open to the public yet. They are only to be used by public transport so most people are still using the Ethereum 1 road, but if people decide to use public transport (a certain layer 2 solution known as a roll-ups), we can decrease the congestion on the Ethereum 1 road.

* *In technical terms, this is where 63 new shards which are connected to the beacon chain are created. These shards aren't available for transactions yet but they do hold data on the state of the Ethereum blockchain. This data can be used by transactions which use the layer 2 scaling solution known as roll-ups, reducing load on ETH 1.*

* **Phase 1.5:** This is when we say goodbye to having two separate roads. The Ethereum 1 lane is merged with the ETH 2.0 road, creating a 64 lane highway. However, the other 63 lanes are still closed to certain traffic (specifically which traffic is still to be determined). Now that cars are moving on the new road, the security guards (ETH 2.0 validators) are now free to get back in their cars if they want to (or they can keep staking) and new ETH is no longer created to pay for the security of the old road.

* *This phase sees the Ethereum 1 chain become a shard on ETH 2, moving it over to proof of stake and connecting it to the other 63 shards. The other shards are not yet able to take all types of transactions yet such as complex transactions which interact with smart contracts (these are the type of transactions you send when using DeFi apps like creating a Maker Vault). Now that the Ethereum 1 chain has moved into its own ETH 2 shard, it is secured by proof of stake and we no longer need to mint new ETH to pay miners to secure the network which happens under proof of work. As a result, the inflation rate of ETH will drop from around 5% annually to around 1% annually (or possibly even going negative thanks to the proposed fee burn and fee market upgrade EIP-1559).*

* **Phase 2:** This is the grand opening of all 64 lanes of the highway. All or almost all traffic will be able to use any lane (the specifics have not yet been determined, certain transactions may have to use certain lanes). The maximum capacity of the Ethereum highway will increase approximately 64x over its current capacity - and that’s not including the effect of public transport (layer 2 scaling solutions) in increasing the number of people who can use this highway in their daily lives! Also, there is no theoretical limit to the number of lanes the highway has. If certain parameters are tweaked and as technology advances, we may be able to add more lanes to the highway if it is deemed necessary.

* *This phase is the last phase for a feature complete ETH 2.0. All or many of the 64 shards will allow for smart contract execution and transactions (it is possible that not all shard will be used for all types of transactions. This is yet to be determined). Another big feature which will ship with this phase is the introduction of eWASM which will replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This will allow developers to code smart contracts in languages other than Solidity, thus greatly increasing the number of people who can build on Ethereum. Finally, phase 2 will also introduce execution environments. Unfortunately this goes beyond my level of knowledge and expertise but basically it allows for more customisations and possibilities for developers.*

#The All Important Question: When?

I realise that I haven’t put in any timelines above as there aren’t any official ones. However, it is important to keep in mind that development of the different phases is happening in parallel, meaning that just because phase 1 hasn’t shipped yet doesn’t mean that phase 2 isn’t already under development. Each phase is currently being worked on. This also means that a delay in phase 0 or phase 1 may not delay the release of phase 2. I have also heard it said that phase 0 is the most complex and it has almost launched as I type this! If I had to guess, I would expect 1-1.5 years per upgrade, putting the full phase 2 launch release between late 2022 and 2024. But like literally everyone in the ETH community, I truly have no idea what the real timeline will look like and it is important to emphasise that Ethereum is not entirely reliant on ETH 2.0 for scaling as we have many other scaling solutions live now or releasing soon, some of which will benefit from the early phases of ETH 2.0 as I mentioned above.

# INSTALLATION GUIDE AND USAGE

**RECOMMENDED HARDWARE AND SETUP**

* Raspberry 4 (model B) - 4GB or 8GB (8 GB RAM highly recommended)
* MicroSD Card (16 GB Class 10 minimum)
* SSD USB 3.0 disk (see storage section)
* Power supply
* Ethernet cable
* Port forwarding
* A case with heatsink and fan (Optional but strongly recommended)
* USB keyboard, Monitor and HDMI cable (micro-HDMI) (Optional)

**STORAGE**

You will need an SSD to run the Ethereum clients (without an SSD drive there’s absolutely no chance of syncing the Ethereum blockchain). There are 2 options:

Use an USB portable SSD disk such as the Samsung T5 Portable SSD.

Use an USB 3.0 External Hard Drive Case with a SSD Disk. In our case we used a Inateck 2.5 Hard Drive Enclosure FE2011. Make sure to buy a case with an UASP compliant chip, particularly, one of these: JMicron (JMS567 or JMS578) or ASMedia (ASM1153E).

In both cases, avoid getting low quality SSD disks as it is a key component of your node and it can drastically affect the performance (and sync times). Keep in mind that you need to plug the disk to an USB 3.0 port (in blue).

**IMAGE DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION**

**1.- Download the image**:

http://www.ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2-medalla.img.zip

SHA256 149cb9b020d1c49fcf75c00449c74c6f38364df1700534b5e87f970080597d87

**2.- Flash the image**

Insert the microSD in your Desktop / Laptop and download the file.

Note: If you are not comfortable with command line or if you are running Windows, you can use Etcher \[10\]

Open a terminal and check your MicroSD device name running:

`sudo fdisk -l`

You should see a device named mmcblk0 or sdd. Unzip and flash the image:

`unzip ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2-medalla.img.zip`

`sudo dd bs=1M if=ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fdatasync status=progress`

**3.- Insert de MicroSD** into the Raspberry Pi 4. Connect an Ethernet cable and attach the USB SSD disk (make sure you are using a blue port).

**4.- Power on the device**

The Ubuntu OS will boot up in less than one minute but you will need to wait approximately 7-8 minutes in order to allow the script to perform the necessary tasks to install the Medalla setup (it will reboot again)

**5.- Log in**

You can log in through SSH or using the console (if you have a monitor and keyboard attached)

    User: ethereum
    Password: ethereum

You will be prompted to change the password on first login, so you will need to log in twice.

**6.- Forward 30303** port in your router (both UDP and TCP). If you don’t know how to do this, google “port forwarding” followed by your router model. You will need to open additional ports as well depending on the Eth2.0 client you’ve chosen.

**7.- Getting console output**

You can see what’s happening in the background by typing:

`sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog`

**8.- Grafana Dashboards**

There are 5 Grafana dashboards available to monitor the Medalla node (see section “Grafana Dashboards” below).

# The Medalla Eth2.0 multi-client testnet

Medalla is the official Eth2.0 multi-client testnet  according to the latest official specification for Eth2.0, the v0.12.2 \[11\] release (which is aimed to be the final) \[12\].

In order to run a Medalla Eth 2.0 node you will need 3 components:

* An Eth1.0 node running the Goerli testnet in sync \[13\]. Geth in our case.
* An Eth2.0 Beacon Chain connected to the Eth1.0 node. You will need to choose a client here (Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku or Nimbus)
* An Eth2.0 Validator connected to the Beacon Chain (same client as the Beacon Chain)

The image takes care of the Eth1.0 setup. So, once flashed (and after a first reboot), Geth (Eth1.0 client) starts to sync the Goerli testnet.

Follow these steps to enable your Eth2.0 Ethereum node:

**CREATE THE VALIDATOR KEYS AND MAKE THE DEPOSIT**

We need to get 32 Goerli ETH (fake ETH) ir order to make the deposit in the Eth2.0 contract and run the validator. The easiest way of getting ETH is by joining Prysm Discord's channel.

Open Metamask \[14\], select the Goerli Network (top of the window) and copy your ETH Address. Go to:

https://discord.com/invite/YMVYzv6

And open the “request-goerli-eth” channel (on the left)

Type:

`!send $YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS (replace it with the one copied on Metamask)`

You will receive enough ETH to run 1 validator.

Now it is time to create your validator keys and the deposit information. For your convenience we’ve packaged the official Eth2 launchpad tool \[4\]. Go to the EF Eth2.0 launchpad site:

[https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/)

And click “Get started”

Read and accept all warnings. In the next screen, select 1 validator and go to your Raspberry Pi console. Under the ethereum account run:

`cd &amp;&amp; deposit --num_validators 1 --chain medalla`

Choose your mnemonic language and type a password for keeping your keys safe. Write down your mnemonic password, press any key and type it again as requested.

Now you have 2 Json files under the validator\_keys directory. A deposit data file for sending the 32 ETH along with your validator public key to the Eth1 chain (goerli testnet) and a keystore file with your validator keys.

Back to the Launchpad website, check ""I am keeping my keys safe and have written down my mnemonic phrase"" and click ""Continue"".

It is time to send the 32 ETH deposit to the Eth1 chain. You need the deposit file (located in your Raspberry Pi). You can, either copy and paste the file content and save it as a new file in your desktop or copy the file from the Raspberry to your desktop through SSH.

**1.- Copy and paste:** Connected through SSH to your Raspberry Pi, type:

`cat validator_keys/deposit_data-$FILE-ID.json (replace $FILE-ID with yours)`

Copy the content (the text in square brackets), go back to your desktop, paste it into your favourite editor and save it as a json file. 

**Or**

**2.- Ssh:** From your desktop, copy the file:

`scp ethereum@$YOUR_RASPBERRYPI_IP:/home/ethereum/validator_keys/deposit_data-$FILE_ID.json /tmp`

Replace the variables with your data. This will copy the file to your desktop /tmp directory.

**Upload the deposit file**

Now, back to the Launchpad website, upload the deposit\_data file and select Metamask, click continue and check all warnings. Continue and click “Initiate the Transaction”. Confirm the transaction in Metamask and wait for the confirmation (a notification will pop up shortly).

The Beacon Chain (which is connected to the Eth1 chain) will detect this deposit (that includes the validator public key) and the Validator will be enabled.

Congrats!, you just started your validator activation process.

**CHOOSE AN ETH2.0 CLIENT**

Time to choose your Eth2.0 client. We encourage you to run Lighthouse, Teku or Nimbus as Prysm is the most used client by far and diversity is key to achieve a resilient and healthy Eth2.0 network.

Once you have decided which client to run (as said, try to run one with low network usage), you need to set up the clients and start both, the beacon chain and the validator. 

These are the instructions for enabling each client (Remember, choose just one Eth2.0 client out of 4):

**LIGHTHOUSE ETH2.0 CLIENT**

**1.- Port forwarding**

You need to open the 9000 port in your router (both UDP and TCP)

**2.- Start the beacon chain**

Under the ethereum account, run:

`sudo systemctl enable lighthouse-beacon`

`sudo systemctl start lighthouse-beacon`

**3.- Start de validator**

We need to import the validator keys. Run under the ethereum account:

`lighthouse account validator import --directory=/home/ethereum/validator_keys`

Then, type your previously defined password and run:

`sudo systemctl enable lighthouse-validator`

`sudo systemctl start lighthouse-validator`

The Lighthouse beacon chain and validator are now enabled

&amp;#x200B;

**PRYSM ETH2.0 CLIENT**

**1.- Port forwarding**

You need to open the 13000 and 12000 ports in your router (both UDP and TCP)

**2.- Start the beacon chain**

Under the ethereum account, run:

`sudo systemctl enable prysm-beacon`

`sudo systemctl start prysm-beacon`

**3.- Start de validator**

We need to import the validator keys. Run under the ethereum account:

`validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=/home/ethereum/validator_keys`

Accept the default wallet path and enter a password for your wallet. Now enter the password previously defined.

Lastly, set up your password and start the client:

`echo ""$YOUR_PASSWORD"" &gt; /home/ethereum/validator_keys/prysm-password.txt`

`sudo systemctl enable prysm-validator`

`sudo systemctl start prysm-validator`

The Prysm beacon chain and the validator are now enabled.

&amp;#x200B;

**TEKU ETH2.0 CLIENT**

**1.- Port forwarding**

You need to open the 9151 port (both UDP and TCP)

**2.- Start the Beacon Chain and the Validator**

Under the Ethereum account, check the name of your keystore file:

`ls /home/ethereum/validator_keys/keystore*`

Set the keystore file name in the teku config file (replace the $KEYSTORE\_FILE variable with the file listed above)

`sudo sed -i 's/changeme/$KEYSTORE_FILE/' /etc/ethereum/teku.conf`

Set the password previously entered:

`echo ""yourpassword"" &gt; validator_keys/teku-password.txt`

Start the beacon chain and the validator:

`sudo systemctl enable teku`

`sudo systemctl start teku`

The Teku beacon chain and validator are now enabled.

&amp;#x200B;

**NIMBUS ETH2.0 CLIENT**

**1.- Port forwarding**

You need to open the 19000 port (both UDP and TCP)

**2.- Start the Beacon Chain and the Validator**

We need to import the validator keys. Run under the ethereum account:

`beacon_node deposits import /home/ethereum/validator_keys --data-dir=/home/ethereum/.nimbus --log-file=/home/ethereum/.nimbus/nimbus.log`

Enter the password previously defined and run:

`sudo systemctl enable nimbus`

`sudo systemctl start nimbus`

The Nimbus beacon chain and validator are now enabled.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT's NEXT**

Now you need to wait for the Eth1 blockchain and the beacon chain to get synced.  In a few hours the validator will get enabled and put into a queue. These are the validator status that you will see until its final activation:

* UNKNOWN STATUS
* DEPOSITED (the beacon chain detected the 32 ETH deposit with your validator public key)
* PENDING (you are in a queue for being activated)
* ACTIVATED

Finally, it will get activated and the staking process will start.

Congratulations!, you join the Medalla Eth2.0 multiclient testnet!

# Grafana Dashboards

We configured 5 Grafana Dashboards to let users monitor both Eth1.0 and Eth2.0 clients. To access the dashboards just open your browser and type your Raspberry IP followed by the 3000 port:

    http://replace_with_your_IP:3000
    user: admin
    passwd: ethereum

There are 5 dashboards available:

* Geth Goerli: Eth1.0 node status
* Prysm: Eth2.0 client status
* Lighthouse: Eth2.0 client status
* Teku: Eth2.0 client status
* Nimbus: Eth2.0 client status
* Ethereum on ARM node: Raspberry Pi board Status

Lots of info here. You can see for example if Geth is in sync by checking (in the Blockchain section) if Headers, Receipts and Blocks fields are aligned or find Eth2.0 chain info.

# Updating the software

We will be keeping the Eth2.0 clients updated through Debian packages in order to keep up with the testnet progress. Basically, you need to update the repo and install the packages through the apt command. For instance, in order to update all packages you would run:

`sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install geth teku nimbus prysm-beacon prysm-validator lighthouse-beacon lighthouse-validator`

Please follow us on Twitter in order to get regular updates and install instructions.

vbuterin,0.0,89.0,"One of the next major challenges for the Ethereum base layer is that  of dealing with the growing state size: currently around 100 GB  including tree nodes and growing by around 50 GB per year. The growing  state is making it increasingly harder to sync the ethereum chain and to  participate as a validator, and risks increasing network centralization  if the state grows, especially if the gas limit is increased further.

There are two main techniques being proposed for how to deal with this problem for the short term:

* **State expiry**: remove state that has not been recently  accessed from the state (think: accessed in the last year), and require  witnesses to revive expired state. This would reduce the state that *everyone* needs to store to a flat \~20-50 GB.
* **Weak statelessness**: only require block proposers to store state, and allow all other nodes to verify blocks statelessly.

Both solutions are well underway in development, and it feels like  around now is the time to switch gear from seeing these ideas as  research problems to seeing them as concrete paths of which at least one  (and perhaps eventually both) need to be implemented into Ethereum.

bitbuggs,0.0,82.0,"What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a platform built using blockchain that allows digital assets to be traded without a middle man. It uses this by using something called smart contracts. An easy way of explaining it would be the ""Internet for Financial Markets"". 

Just how the Internet connects computers so information can be transacted freely, Ethereum connects Buyers and sellers so they can also transact easy. On Ethereum, anyone can make a token to represent anything, from a house title, a car title, a State currency, gold, stocks, commodities, ect. When a token is built on Ethereum, it can then be traded easily with out a middle man; just like information travels through the internet without a middle man. Since Ethereum is an internet of markets, not only can you trade anything on Ethereum, you can trade any asset for any other asset. 

Hypothetically lets say you have the deed to your house on the Ethereum blockchain and you want to sell that house for Tesla stock. Well with Ethereum this is possible. Even if no one wants to buy your house with Tesla stock, Ethereum can automatically sell your house for US dollars, then in the same transaction use those dollars to buy tesla stock for the price you requested. These type of transactions are possible for for any asset that is built on Ethereum. The significance of this is that it makes a liquid market for any asset. 

The purpose of Ether, the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, is that Ether is what is used as the transaction fee for the network. Any transaction that happens on the network has to pay a small fee in Ether for the transaction to go through. This is what makes Ethereum so attractive as an investment. If everyone needs to use this coin to transact on the network, then the demand for the coin will be high. 

Currently there are hundreds of applications on Ethereum that allow you to buy, sell, loan, or borrow thousands of different tokens. If you decide to loan your USDC (Ethereum's bank backed stable coin) on an Ethereum application, you could make around a 4% variable interest rate on your money (Try to get that from a savings account). Other applications allow you to participate in lotteries where losing tickets don't lose value and prediction markets to bet on real world event. With Ethereum, possibilities are endless. 

**Potential Risk:** Like any investment, there are some risk for this coin. First, Ethereum can only handle around 15 transactions per second. This means that the more people that try to use Ethereum, the less efficient it will be. Over the last few weeks, users of Ethereum saw transaction fees go up to $50+ for a single smart contract transaction. Although there are plans to make Ethereum more scalable in the future, accomplishing this goal will take a few years at best.

Smart contract hacks are another risk of Ethereum. Smart contracts are the programs on Ethereum that give instructions to what you want the transaction to do. Sometimes these contracts get hacked taking all the assets that the contracts can hold. Although that is usually the fault of the smart contract programmer, it is still something that is not uncommon on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Currently Ethereum is the most used and trusted smart contract blockchain. Although it has its flaws, developers are working around the clock to fix these issues and make the best product they can.",ethereum,"Ethereum, The internet for Markets. (An easy guide for newbies)",82.0,0.95

Always_Question,0.0,171.0,"**Some Background**

The roadmap for Ethereum has evolved over the years, in good ways.  Not too long ago, ETH 2 was divided into phases, roughly as follows:

Phase 0: Staking on the Beacon chain (completed / happens today).  
Phase 1: Data Sharding.  
Phase 1.5: the Merge.  
Phase 2: TBD (this phase is/was the most nebulous; basically, there could be further improvements made to Ethereum).

**These Phases Need Not Happen Chronologically**

In recent months, Vitalik, Danny R., and others, have clarified that Phases 1 and 1.5 need not occur in that order.  In other words, the Merge could be prioritized and implemented before Data Sharding.  I urge the community to prioritize the Merge over Data Sharding for at least the following reasons:

* Rollup tech buys us time.  Both optimistic rollups and ZK rollups are now coming online.  These have the ability to scale Ethereum from less than 10 TPS to over 1000 TPS.  We gain at least two orders of magnitude of scaling with rollups.  Once major DAPPs such as Uniswap migrate to L2 (it is happening!), then fee pressure on L1 will be greatly alleviated.  And it is all happening in the short term, over the course of the next few months.  I estimate that this will provide at least 1 to 2 years before Data Sharding is needed to further scale Ethereum to 100,000+ TPS.
* Having the Merge at the ready provides a fallback for the community should a cartel of miners collude to neutralize the positive effects of EIP 1559.  There are some within the mining community who have threatened to form a group of miners to essentially prevent some aspects of EIP 1559 from having their intended effect.  While I believe it would be difficult or impossible for this group of miners to pull this off, there is a small chance that they might be successful.  The community would rightly interpret such an action to be an attack on the network.  The mere fact that the Merge is prioritized before Data Sharding might be enough to ward off such an attack like a Sword of Damocles, given that the Merge is the final separation of POW miners from the network.  This would further incentivize the mining community not to attempt to subvert the network.
* The Merge brings immediate liquidity to POS stakers who have tied up their ETH.
* The Merge is technically less complex than Data Sharding, albeit still with significant implications to the network.  It shouldn't be rushed, but it also should not be delayed.  Careful development with multiple testnets are obviously called for.  Overall, it is better to implement the technically-less-complex option having more immediate benefits to the community, and then shift community attention to the technically-more-challenging Data Sharding effort.",ethereum,Why the Merge Should Be Prioritized Over Data Sharding,171.0,0.97

Here's how Argent is ensuring its wallet owners are in the best position possible if the crazy congestion of the last couple of days happens again. 

We’ll work on five points:

1. Improving the visibility of transaction statuses
2. Giving you more granular control of transactions in an emergency
3. Managing expectations during congestion
4. Doing our bit to help minimise congestion
5. Improving trading within Argent",ethereum,"Crypto, Corona and Congestion: Argent's Lessons Learned from the Last Two Days",74.0,0.94

In fact, I purchased Website Domains related to this topic, I did wanted to sell those for ETH, in a sort of Publicity Stunt, but to my surprise there isnt a single marketplace I could list the domain under anything else than FIAT currency. So I had the Idea: Instead of selling it, use it and create the plattform I envision. Yes I could as well say in the description I only take ETH and sell the Item for 1$, but this might fuck up some things if there are suddenly 200 people wanting it for 1$ but Im not selling it because I only want crypto.

JonhyAppleseed,0.0,76.0,"I recently came across a couple articles regarding ETH staking. To create your own validator, one needs 32 Eth. I dont have 32 ETH and looked at other alternatives like a mining pool. 

**Mining Pools Ive looked at**

\- Rocket Pool

\- Ankr

\- Binance (US)

\- Kraken (US)

At first I liked Binance and Kraken. Trusted sites, secure, etc.... However, since I am in the US, I am completely unable to pull out my staked ETH for an unknown amount of time.

I have a little more than 3 Eth at the moment, and plan on holding it long term - minimally, 5 years. In this aspect, I should have no problem staking my Eth on a site like BinanceUS or Kraken. Now, looking at all my options, I can also stake on a site like Ankr. If staked 5.5 Eth, I could get .64 Eth a year. That .64 a year continues to increase over the years, all while the price goes up. And to top it all off, If Eth tanks I can liquify my Eth for aETH, unlinke binance or kraken.

I believe in ETH long term. I like having access to my ETH. I plan to continue accumulating ETH as years go on, and figure I should put my ETH to work by staking.

If the limit is reached, meaning gas price &lt; the limit you setup , a telegram message will be sent to you to let you know that (To avoid spamming user, a limit at 10mins per message has been set. When an alert is sent to your phone, the next one will be sent 10mins after)

As a bonus, because some websites are not as easy as we thought on mobile, you’ll just have to send: /price to receive directly the gas price for (in GWEI):

* Average
* and Fast transactions

Hey everyone! We're excited to introduce Ceramic to the world. Ceramic is the protocol for a connected, interoperable web without silos. [http://ceramic.network](http://ceramic.network/)

What is Ceramic?

Ceramic is a new permissionless protocol for creating unstoppable documents that serve as the foundation for an interoperable web without silos.

Ceramic's public infrastructure allows participants to create signed, versioned, tamper-proof documents that act as a censorship-resistant and universally available source of truth for important information. Because Ceramic's Universal Document Graph is public, permissionless, and verifiable, it unlocks information access and interoperability between *all platforms and services across the web.*

This is a critical requirement for building interoperable systems that need to operate outside the bounds of any single wallet, application, database, service, or network silo. Such as:

&amp;#x200B;

* Portable, self-sovereign identity
* Shared data schemas and definitions
* Interoperable user &amp; app data storage
* Open web services, without accounts or signups
* User-managed access control permissions

Ceramic supports these use cases by storing documents that represent decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and their associated metadata, data schemas, service definitions and routing info, policies for usage of services, hosting agreements, access control permissions and much more. Collectively, these documents enable boundless identity-centric interoperability, routing, and access control between an ecosystem of connected wallets, applications, databases, and services.

With Ceramic, a user can always control their identity and resources regardless of which wallet they're using, which app they're on, which DB it's in, or where a service is hosted/located. This allows devs to build composable apps with unprecedented modularity, trust, and scale. As a result, Ceramic is the trusted foundation upon which a more connected, transparent, and user-centric internet is built.

*Side Note* Ceramic documents are a very general abstraction that can be used to represent almost any type of information that requires guaranteed trust, interoperability, and censorship-resistance. We invite you to explore what's possible on Ceramic.

shhbrunette,0.0,70.0,"Hey guys, founder of [cryptotaxcalculator.io](https://cryptotaxcalculator.io) here. At the time of writing gas price is 197 Wei and to do a trade on Uniswap cost around $100 in ETH. This is a significant amount for most users, and adding this to your cost basis is an important part in minimizing your taxes. But in most circumstances you will also need to consider the capital gains realised on the ETH you are spending for gas. 

**Example**

| Date          | Trade | Currency | Price | Quantity | Gas (ETH)  | ETH Price |
|---------------|-------|----------|-------|----------| ---------- | --------  |
| 1st Jan 2017  | Buy   | ETH      | 30    | 2        |  -         | -         |
| 4th Oct 2020  | Buy   | SUSHI    | 200   | 1        |  -         | -         |
| 6th Feb 2020  | Sell  | SUSHI    | 1000  | 1        |  0.1       | 1000      |
| 6th Feb 2020  | Buy   | DAI      | 1000  | 1        |  -         | -         |

In the above example Satoshi sells $1,000 worth of SUSHI on Uniswap for DAI. To do this he pays $100 in gas using ETH. He originally bought his Sushi for $200, and his ETH for $30 each. Satoshi realised a profit of $800 by selling his sushi (1000 - 200), but he also had $100 worth of gas fees, so he overall realised gain is $700 (1000 - 200 - 100). However he originally bought ETH at $30, and at the time of the transaction ETH was worth $1000, so Satoshi needs to consider the gain in ETH. This would be calculated as $97 ((1000 - 30) * 0.1). As you can see there is a lot going on here. 

Fortunately [CryptoTaxCalculator](https://cryptotaxcalculator.io) is one of the few crypto tax softwares to carefully consider this scenario. All you need to do is import your Ethereum public wallet address into our app, and we will automatically categorise all your transactions and handle these calculations for you. Just sanity check the results and you are sorted.

However, the one thing that keeps me coming back to regular banks is privacy. I absolutely hate that my employer can see all my funds and I have to pay upwards of $20 to wash money through tornado cash everytime (while uniswap trades are below $5).

If it wasn't for the lack of privacy I would have literally no reason to ever leave the ecosystem and with PayPal payments coming soon I'll no longer need to buy giftcards to buy from non-crypto stores.

Its disappointing that the focus with L2s is 500+ TPS. $0.77 fees for transactions aren't even that much of an issue, it's slightly inconvenient but it's not off putting.

mytwentythredditid,0.0,65.0,"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/18204 There's your answer. Let me break it down for you:

1. User (in 2017) hates Geth sync performance and starts hacking on the code. Finds that disabling fsync makes the node sync so fast that a normal HDD can be used for syncing. (See Fsync section of this post)
2. User creates patch.
3. Many discussions take place about whether this is a good idea or not.
4. One of the discussion threads is 'isn't fsync off by default?' 'yes it is' 'but when I explicitly turn it off, things go faster.' 'yea, I see that behavior too!'
4. Charts and tests are performed to validate that explicitly disabling fsync indeed does speed up syncing.
5. Change is ultimately rejected

##What the heck is Fsync?

You need to put 10 pieces of elbow macaroni into a bowl. The 10 noodles you need are already pulled out and laid on the table. There are a few ways to move them into the bowl:

1. Pick each one up, one at a time, and move it to the bowl.
2. Pick up as many as you can in small batches and drop them into the bowl in batches.
3. Sweep your hand across the table surface and move them all into your other hand, then drop all 10 into the bowl at once.

Almost everyone will be able to do #3 faster than #1 or #2. Everyone understands that #1 is the slowest. Modern computers, by default, try to do #3 when you write anything to any form of permanent storage. They try to *buffer* the data (macaroni) into a big batch, and then flush all that data to physical media at once for efficiency reasons.

Fsync is a way to force the computer to take whatever data is currently in the buffer and write it physical storage **RIGHT NOW!** It would be like if you started to sweep the macaroni into your hand, but then you saw your baby was about to fall and you only had 3 noodles in your hand; you'd (in reality drop the noodles, but meh) immediately stop trying to get more noodles, and drop them into the bowl so you could go save your baby. Fsync is that request to 'stop and flush'.

## Why does this matter?
The reason that SATA and NVMe both offer the same syncing performance (or darn near it) is because what Geth's storage backend is doing is calling fsync every single time you write to the database. They are writing to the database anywhere from 5,000 - 20,000 times per second. And that's just what they can do **with** fsync; they'd actually try to write even more often without fsync.

'But my SSD can handle 50,000 IOPS!' It can, but this is different. When you call fsync(), the function doesn't return until **after** the data is 'confirmed' as flushed to storage. That confirmation takes time, on the order of milliseconds for slow SSDs, and microseconds for fast ones. If you have to wait 100 microseconds per IO to disk, then you can only write 10,000 things to disk per second if you call fsync after each write. This also explains why some people see a huge performance difference going from SATA to NVMe and others don't. If you are going from QLC NAND in a SATA drive to 2-bit NAND in a NVMe drive, then you'll see a HUGE write speed increase (from ~1ms per write to ~50 microseconds per write). You'll be able to write data a LOT faster.

But if you have two 3-bit SSDs, one SATA, one NVMe, you'll see that they both write at basically the same speed. Or if you have one SSD with 4 memory chips and another with 2, you might see the 4-chip SSD perform better than the 2 chip, because the controller (if its smart enough) can do 4 writes at once instead of 2 {2 vs 4 * however many writes the actual memory chip can handle internally}. 

Fsync is not a bad thing, especially for a database. In fact, it's absolutely critical to good database health and performance! What is bad is that, in Geth, right now, it's being called too much.

##What needs to change?

The devs need to rethink how they interact with the storage layer. Right now, today, they simply get each transaction and write it directly to DB. Which, in turn, means fsync() is called after each and every transaction written by the internal leveldb code from Google.

What needs to happen instead is:

1. They need to define and keep record of a 'checkpoint' of what data in the DB is known-good,
2. Issue writes to the DB as they do now with fsync explicitly disabled
3. Once an interval has passed (100tx? 10 blocks? 1 second? 10 seconds? etc; some combination of criteria) they need to call fsync() once to flush the data to the DB and ensure the data is in the DB consistently, and then a second time to update the DB with the most recently written data as the current checkpoint for 'known-good' DB content.
4. Change the node boot code to look for this checkpoint, and roll back any DB commits that occurred after the checkpoint.

What I am describing is exactly how transactional databases are supposed to work. I am literally describing a traditional MySQL/Oracle DB transaction. 'Start up, do some work, commit changes as a batch; roll back everything if something goes wrong'. This is a significant change for the backend because what they have right now assumes that every single write to the DB is its own transcation, and that simply doesn't scale. It didn't work in 2017, it doesn't work in 2020.

[The last time](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/cwglyq/geth_performance_insights/) I wrote about Geth IO performance I was really mean, hostile, and toxic. I was so angry because I was convinced that the devs simply didn't care at worst, or were utterly incompetent at best. Neither were the case. They are totally willing to fix problems if someone is able to explain what is wrong and why. [The next release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases?after=v1.9.6) after that post (1.9.4) actually did address the biggest issue in my post (my post = Aug 28, 2019; 1.9.4 == Sept 19, 2020), which was them writing TB of data to storage every hour. That is an incredibly fast turn around time.

If Geth were able to run at a performance level close to that of bitcoin, Monero, or other altcoin nodes, where a spinning HDD was able to run a full node, then it can only strengthen adoption of the coin because the resources to run the node and coin now scale horizontally (2 machines = 2x faster) with hardware, rather than vertically (upgrading from platinum magic to unobtainum magic in a single machine is the only way to get more fasta).

## P.S. 

Seriously, make the leveldb files &gt; 2MB as well. Make them 400-500MB. Please. It will make things so much faster. do that and fix the over-use of fsync and you'll have a node that is near bitcoin levels of sync speed! Maybe. :p [This has been brought up before](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15704)",ethereum,"Ever wondered why Geth nodes take so long to sync on an SSD, and why SATA vs NVMe doesn't seem to matter?",65.0,0.93

I felt like Rarible would be a good first place to start and hopefully stand out as a jewel among some of the crap. I already had some ethereum and had to transfer it to a wallet. That's the first fee. Whenever you transfer the stuff, it costs money. I connected my wallet, which practically serves as your profile and place where you keep collectibles as well as crypto. I picked a scan of a drawing that I liked and began the upload process. It's all pretty easy, but they don't really talk about how expensive it is to post things. This scales based on the  workload of the network. And now, it's crazy high. I spent about $60 to post after all the fees, and that's when it was pretty low. I was open to any transaction, I just wanted someone to have my art and see how it works, so I left the bid open. After I posted it to the gram, my friend placed a $1 bid! Cool! I'll take anything for the first time trying! Excited, I accepted and found that there was a $100 miner fee... again... to complete the bid. Now, I'm no business major, but none of this makes any sense. So I'm boiling this experience down to the following feelings/possibilities: right now it's too expensive to add your work because a lot of people are using the network to process things. Unless you have work that will sell enough to cover miner fees, it isn't worth it. There may be better websites to post on, but some of them require an application process. Could some sites be playing off the recent publicity and just trying to make a dime off the little guy through fees? How are so many things selling for so low? Fees, fees, and more fees. I once told myself I'd never pay to play again but I feel like I paid and got played... On purpose. Overall, I was happy to take a risk and learn some valuable lessons. Actually, I still haven't really learned much. But I did spend almost $200 to let my friend have a digital version of my art.

One very sad story did come to our attention this week. Dawid ([D13Kabani](https://twitter.com/D13Kabani)) a father of two and Aavegotchi enthusiast staking GHST, made the type of mistake that every crypto user fears the most. He rushed a simple copy paste, mistakenly sending his entire LINK holdings (the great majority of his on-chain savings) to the GHST staking contract he’d previously interacted with instead of to the Binance deposit address he’d intended.

With crypto, there is no undo button and those LINK are irretrievably stuck in the non-upgradeable [GHST staking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93ea6ec350ace7473f7694d43dec2726a515e31a).

Many of us have had our own learning experiences with crypto, and this can easily be shrugged off as another case of “lesson learned.” BUT just because this situation is not amendable on a technical level, doesn’t mean we as a community, in the spirit of charity and goodwill, can’t do something kind for this poor chap.

That’s why we’ve set up a SantaGotchi Wallet. On Christmas day we will be transferring whatever has been deposited in this wallet to Dawid, a father, GotchiGang member and Link Marine.

Any little bit can help, let’s show our humanity this holiday season and try to help take the edge off for Dawid, even if just a bit.

We are excited to participate and present Syscoin Platform's ideal characteristics and capabilities towards a well-rounded Reddit Community Points solution!

Our scaling solution for Reddit Community Points involves 2-way peg interoperability with Ethereum. This will provide a scalable token layer built specifically for speed and high volumes of simple value transfers at a very low cost, while providing sovereign ownership and onchain finality.

Token transfers scale by taking advantage of a globally sorting mempool that provides for probabilistically secure assumptions of “as good as settled”. The opportunity here for token receivers is to have an app-layer interactivity on the speed/security tradeoff (99.9999% assurance within 10 seconds). We call this Z-DAG, and it achieves high-throughput across a mesh network topology presently composed of about 2,000 geographically dispersed full-nodes. Similar to Bitcoin, however, these nodes are incentivized to run full-nodes for the benefit of network security, through a bonded validator scheme. These nodes do not participate in the consensus of transactions or block validation any differently than other nodes and therefore do not degrade the security model of Bitcoin’s *validate first then trust,* across every node. Each token transfer settles on-chain. The protocol follows Bitcoin core policies so it has adequate code coverage and protocol hardening to be qualified as production quality software. It shares a significant portion of Bitcoin’s own hashpower through [merged-mining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification).

This platform as a whole can serve token microtransactions, larger settlements, and store-of-value in an ideal fashion, providing probabilistic scalability whilst remaining decentralized according to Bitcoin design. It is accessible to ERC-20 via a permissionless and trust-minimized bridge that works in both directions. The bridge and token platform are currently available on the Syscoin mainnet. This has been gaining [recent attention](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684900781/Binance-Blockchain-Foundry-Work-Together-for-Wider-BUSD-Access) for use by loyalty point programs and stablecoins such as Binance USD.

# Solutions

Syscoin Foundation identified a few paths for Reddit to leverage this infrastructure, each with trade-offs. The first provides the most cost-savings and scaling benefits at some sacrifice of token autonomy. The second offers more preservation of autonomy with a more narrow scope of cost savings than the first option, but savings even so. The third introduces more complexity than the previous two yet provides the most overall benefits. We consider the third as most viable as it enables Reddit to benefit even while retaining existing smart contract functionality. **We will focus on the third option, and include the first two for good measure.**

1. Distribution, burns and user-to-user transfers of Reddit Points are entirely carried out on the Syscoin network. This full-on approach to utilizing the Syscoin network provides the most scalability and transaction cost benefits of these scenarios. The tradeoff here is distribution and subscription handling likely migrating away from smart contracts into the application layer.
2. The Reddit Community Points ecosystem can continue to use existing smart contracts as they are used today on the Ethereum mainchain. Users migrate a portion of their tokens to Syscoin, the scaling network, to gain much lower fees, scalability, and a proven base layer, without sacrificing sovereign ownership. They would use Syscoin for user-to-user transfers. Tips redeemable in ten seconds or less, a high-throughput relay network, and onchain settlement at a block target of 60 seconds.
3. **Integration between Matic Network and Syscoin Platform - similar to Syscoin’s current integration with Ethereum - will provide Reddit Community Points with EVM scalability (including the Memberships ERC777 operator) on the Matic side, and performant simple value transfers, robust decentralized security, and sovereign store-of-value on the Syscoin side. It’s “the best of both worlds”. The trade-off is more complex interoperability.**

# Syscoin + Matic Integration

[Matic](https://matic.network) and [Blockchain Foundry Inc](https://blockchainfoundry.co), the public company formed by the founders of [Syscoin](https://syscoin.org), recently [entered a partnership](https://syscoin.org/news/blockchain-foundry-and-matic-network-establish-partnership-towards-full-scope-scalability-involving-syscoin-platform) for joint research and business development initiatives. This is ideal for all parties as Matic Network and Syscoin Platform provide complementary utility. Syscoin offers characteristics for sovereign ownership and security based on Bitcoin’s time-tested model, and shares a significant portion of Bitcoin’s own hashpower. Syscoin’s focus is on secure and scalable simple value transfers, trust-minimized interoperability, and opt-in regulatory compliance for tokenized assets rather than scalability for smart contract execution. On the other hand, Matic Network can provide scalable EVM for smart contract execution. Reddit Community Points can benefit from both.

Syscoin + Matic integration is actively being explored by both teams, as it is helpful to Reddit, Ethereum, and the industry as a whole.

# Proving Performance &amp; Cost Savings

Our POC focuses on 100,000 on-chain settlements of token transfers on the Syscoin Core blockchain. Transfers and burns perform equally with Syscoin. For POCs related to smart contracts (subscriptions, etc), refer to the Matic Network proposal.

**On-chain settlement of 100k transactions was accomplished within roughly twelve minutes**, well-exceeding Reddit’s expectation of five days. This was performed using six full-nodes operating on compute-optimized AWS c4.2xlarge instances which were geographically distributed (Virginia, London, Sao Paulo Brazil, Oregon, Singapore, Germany).  **A higher quantity of settlements could be reached within the same time-frame with more broadcasting nodes involved, or using hosts with more resources for faster execution of the process.**

It is important to note that this POC is not focused on Z-DAG. The performance of Z-DAG has been benchmarked within realistic network conditions: [Whiteblock’s audit](https://whiteblock.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ZDAG-Analysis.pdf) is publicly available. Network latency tests showed an average TPS around 15k with burst capacity up to 61k. Zero-latency control group exhibited \~150k TPS. Mainnet testing of the Z-DAG network is achievable and will require further coordination and additional resources.

Even further optimizations are expected in the upcoming Syscoin Core release which will implement a UTXO model for our token layer bringing further efficiency as well as open the door to additional scaling technology currently under research by our team and academic partners. At present our token layer is account-based, similar to Ethereum. Opt-in compliance structures will also be introduced soon which will offer some positive performance characteristics as well. It makes the most sense to implement these optimizations before performing another benchmark for Z-DAG, especially on the mainnet considering the resources required to stress-test this network.

## Cost Savings

**Total cost for these 100k transactions: $0.63 USD**

See the [live fee comparison](https://syscoin.org/fees/) for savings estimation between transactions on Ethereum and Syscoin. Below is a snapshot at time of writing:

ETH price: $318.55    ETH gas price: 55.00 Gwei ($0.37)

Syscoin price: $0.11

[Snapshot of live fee comparison chart](https://preview.redd.it/74a0j0oxh8e51.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9cef064c991a6c279f07f7153a5e54b2409b33e)

Z-DAG provides a more efficient fee-market.  **A typical Z-DAG transaction costs 0.0000582 SYS.** Tokens can be safely redeemed/re-spent within seconds or allowed to settle on-chain beforehand.  The costs should remain about this low for microtransactions.

Syscoin will achieve further reduction of fees and even greater scalability with offchain payment channels for assets, with Z-DAG as a resilience fallback. New payment channel technology is one of the topics under research by the Syscoin development team with our academic partners at TU Delft. In line with the calculation in the Lightning Networks white paper, payment channels using assets with Syscoin Core will bring theoretical capacity for each person on Earth (7.8 billion) to have five on-chain transactions per year, per person, without requiring anyone to enter a fee market (aka “wait for a block”). This exceeds the minimum LN expectation of two transactions per person, per year; one to exist on-chain and one to settle aggregated value.

Main Subprojects

* [Sysethereum contracts](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-contracts): Ethereum contract deployment source code.
* [Sysethereum agents](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-agents): External agents.
* [Sysethereum Dapp](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-dapp): UI Dapp for reference implementation. The Sysethereum-Dapp automates the process flows depicted in “[Syscoin Bridge &amp; How it Works](https://syscoin.readme.io/docs/what-is-sysethereum-bridge-how-does-it-work)” within a native ReactJS application for convenience. **An active implementation using the Syscoin Platform Mainnet can be used at**[ **bridge.syscoin.org**](https://bridge.syscoin.org/)**.**

## API

Tools to simplify using Syscoin Bridge as a service with dapps and wallets will be released some time after implementation of Syscoin Core 4.2. These will be based upon the same processes which are automated in the current live [Sysethereum Dapp](https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-dapp) that is functioning with the Syscoin mainnet.

## Trade-off

The Syscoin Ethereum Bridge is secured by Agent nodes participating in a decentralized and incentivized model that involves roles of Superblock challengers and submitters. This model is open to participation. The benefits here are trust-minimization, permissionless-ness, and potentially less legal/regulatory red-tape than interop mechanisms that involve liquidity providers and/or trading mechanisms.

The trade-off is that due to the decentralized nature there are cross-chain settlement times of one hour to cross from Ethereum to Syscoin, and three hours to cross from Syscoin to Ethereum. We are exploring ways to reduce this time while maintaining decentralization via zkp. Even so, an “instant bridge” experience could be provided by means of a third-party liquidity mechanism. That option exists but is not required for bridge functionality today. Typically bridges are used with batch value, not with high frequencies of smaller values, and generally it is advantageous to keep some value on both chains for maximum availability of utility.  Even so, the cross-chain settlement time is good to mention here.

## Cost

**Ethereum -&gt; Syscoin**:  Matic or Ethereum transaction fee for bridge contract interaction, negligible Syscoin transaction fee for minting tokens

**Syscoin -&gt; Ethereum:** Negligible Syscoin transaction fee for burning tokens, 0.01% transaction fee paid to Bridge Agent in the form of the ERC-20, Matic or Ethereum transaction fee for contract interaction.

## Z-DAG

Zero-Confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph is an instant settlement protocol that is used as a complementary system to proof-of-work (PoW) in the confirmation of Syscoin service transactions. In essence, a Z-DAG is simply a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where validating nodes verify the sequential ordering of transactions that are received in their memory pools. Z-DAG is used by the validating nodes across the network to ensure that there is absolute consensus on the ordering of transactions and no balances are overflowed (no double-spends).

## Benefits

* Unique fee-market that is more efficient for microtransaction redemption and settlement
* Uses decentralized means to enable tokens with value transfer scalability that is comparable or exceeds that of credit card networks
* Provides high throughput and secure fulfillment even if blocks are full
* Probabilistic and interactive
* 99.9999% security assurance within 10 seconds
* Can serve payment channels as a resilience fallback that is faster and lower-cost than falling-back directly to a blockchain
* Each Z-DAG transaction also settles onchain through Syscoin Core at 60-second block target using SHA-256 Proof of Work consensus

## API

[Syscoin-js](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin-js) provides tooling for all Syscoin Core RPCs including interactivity with Z-DAG.

[Z-DAG White Paper](https://syscoin.org/zdag_syscoin_whitepaper.pdf)

Useful read: [An in-depth Z-DAG discussion between Syscoin Core developer Jag Sidhu and Brave Software Research Engineer Gonçalo Pestana](https://hackmd.io/dStpqSfDQVC3T7W7jptjOQ)

## Trade-off

Z-DAG enables the ideal speed/security tradeoff to be determined per use-case in the application layer. It minimizes the sacrifice required to accept and redeem fast transfers/payments while providing more-than-ample security for microtransactions. This is supported on the premise that a Reddit user receiving points does need security yet generally doesn’t want nor need to wait for the same level of security as a nation-state settling an international trade debt. In any case, each Z-DAG transaction settles onchain at a block target of 60 seconds.

# Syscoin Specs

[Syscoin 3.0 White Paper](https://syscoin.org/syscoin3_whitepaper.pdf)

(4.0 white paper is pending. For improved scalability and less blockchain bloat, some features of v3 no longer exist in current v4: Specifically Marketplace Offers, Aliases, Escrow, Certificates, Pruning, Encrypted Messaging)

* 16MB block bandwidth per minute assuming segwit witness carrying transactions, and transactions \~200 bytes on average
* SHA256 merge mined with Bitcoin
* UTXO asset layer, with base Syscoin layer sharing identical security policies as Bitcoin Core
* Z-DAG on asset layer, bridge to Ethereum on asset layer
* On-chain scaling with prospect of enabling enterprise grade reliable trustless payment processing with on/offchain hybrid solution
* **Focus only on Simple Value Transfers**. MVP of blockchain consensus footprint is balances and ownership of them. Everything else can reduce data availability in exchange for scale (Ethereum 2.0 model). **We leave that to other designs, we focus on transfers.**
* Future integrations of MAST/Taproot to get more complex value transfers without trading off trustlessness or decentralization.
* Zero-knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic new frontier. We are dabbling here to generalize the concept of bridging and also verify the state of a chain efficiently. We also apply it in our Digital Identity projects at Blockchain Foundry (a publicly traded company which develops Syscoin softwares for clients). We are also looking to integrate privacy preserving payment channels for off-chain payments through zkSNARK hub &amp; spoke design which does not suffer from the HTLC attack vectors evident on LN. Much of the issues plaguing Lightning Network can be resolved using a zkSNARK design whilst also providing the ability to do a multi-asset payment channel system. Currently [we found a showstopper attack](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/72#issuecomment-613736569) (American Call Option) on LN if we were to use multiple-assets. This would not exist in a system such as [this](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/libzkchannels).

## Wallets

Web3 and mobile wallets are under active development by Blockchain Foundry Inc as WebAssembly applications and expected for release not long after mainnet deployment of Syscoin Core 4.2. Both of these will be multi-coin wallets that support Syscoin, SPTs, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens. The Web3 wallet will provide functionality similar to Metamask.

Syscoin Platform and tokens are already integrated with Blockbook. Custom hardware wallet support currently exists via [ElectrumSys](https://github.com/syscoin/electrumsys/releases/tag/1.0.0). First-class HW wallet integration through apps such as Ledger Live will exist after 4.2.

ilblackdragon,0.0,68.0,"Hi Reddit &amp; community,

This is a submission to The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-off from the DigitalMOB team, which built on the NEAR platform. DigitalMOB is an experienced development team who has built dozens of complex applications on Ethereum during their time at Consensys and who chose to build on the NEAR Protocol for this challenge because it’s the right tool for the job.

...And because building on NEAR is kind of fun.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

The whole point of having community points is so communities can independently build identities for themselves and **experiment**.  In a challenge like this, scalability is just the cost of entry!  What really matters is how easy it is for people to hack on, experiment with and play with the underlying technology.

Yes, NEAR can grow TPS linearly.  200\*x\^n, woo!

Yes, NEAR allows Reddit to pay for stuff on behalf of users while the users keep control of it.

Yes, NEAR preserves composability and interoperability so apps can scale and connect without thinking.

...But, most importantly, NEAR is the \*only\* chain designed to bring all this to the table AND preserve that magic which makes developing on a new platform so cool -- a rad developer experience, the flexibility for amateurs to create new features and **the ability to build things that no one thought were possible.**

&amp;#x200B;

## About NEAR

NEAR is a decentralized application platform built atop the NEAR Protocol, which is a new public, proof-of-stake blockchain that has been designed to focus on scalability and usability.  It has some similarities to the Ethereum 2.0 proposal but optimizes for faster block times and a more flexible account model.

For the purposes of this challenge, NEAR highlights the power of a sharded design versus other alternatives which claim to offer high TPS values but don't actually scale once that threshold has been realized.  NEAR scales better than a layer 2 solution and has more interoperability as well.  Also important, it has been designed from the ground up to improve developer and user experience so apps that build on it can actually be used by real humans.

One of the core issues recently with user experience is constantly climbing fees, and NEAR addresses this issue by linearly scaling as demand increases via a database technique called ""sharding"".  Network congestion and fee spikes don't persist because new supply is added whenever demand gets too high.

To attract developers, NEAR provides SDKs for common and loved languages like AssemblyScript (compilable TypeScript) and Rust with integrated testing tooling.

The novel account model provides new ways of users interacting with the blockchain that are hard or impossible to build on other chains. As an example, the [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) showcases some of the most common use cases.

&amp;#x200B;

# Scaling

Currently running with a single shard on MainNet and TestNet, we are getting **\~200 mint/burn transactions per second for this contract per shard**. As more shards will get added and by sharding this contract, expect to linearly grow this number as demand increases.  This is different from other solutions which run on fancy hardware but can't actually expand their capacity as the network becomes more popular and crowded.

Sharding is also the only technique for designing a system that allows applications the same composability as a single-threaded chain while keeping fees at the same level across the network. Other solutions, including layer 2s, generally isolate the application onto a high performance island which prevents it from properly interoperating with other applications on the network.  This defeats the purpose of making community tokens a tool for easy experimentation.

NEAR has deliberately capped each shard's performance so it is easier to run nodes using standard hardware, which allows the network to scale much further in the long run (similarly to how Amazon AWS scales on commodity hardware well beyond the ability of any one supercomputer). Most nodes are running on 2 vCPU machines.

Most importantly, building on NEAR means **developers don't actually have to think about how this scaling happens.** They design their apps and the system automatically handles the resharding necessary to make those apps run.

&amp;#x200B;

# Decentralization

Sharding and lower requirements for validators are designed to drive more decentralization on the overall network, both for consensus and data replication. Even hobbyists can run both validating and non validating nodes (we have [200+ nodes](https://explorer.betanet.near.org/nodes/validators) in one of our test networks mostly by hobbyists).  NEAR is designed to be at least as decentralized as Ethereum.

This demo is architected such that **if Reddit disappears forever, it doesn't affect the user's ability to operate their accounts, withdraw funds or transfer funds**.

Specifically, the Reddit demo has a back end which provides approval for the user in order to cover their transaction fees and which can be used to create token minting requests and other service functions. In production, this will be operated by reddit.com and linked to the sign up and upvote flows on the website / app.  But it is not required for the functionality of the chain to be accessed.

&amp;#x200B;

# Usability

NEAR has been focused on usability from the start and provides a variety of tools to developers to improve UX for their users.

NEAR has a uniquely flexible account structure, where an account is named with a human readable name like “foo.near” and can have multiple keys accessing it with different permissions. This opens up a lot of functionality, including that a user can easily add other wallets / devices to their account.  Most importantly here, it becomes **quite easy for apps to pay for fees on behalf of users**.

There are three ways that users can interact with apps build on top of the network:

1. Using a self custody wallet and paying their own fees, similar to Metamask on Ethereum.
2. Using a self custody wallet and letting a third-party pay fees for them. In this case the operator must whitelist this user (by allowing their keys to sign transactions on their behalf).
3. Relying on a third-party operator who custodies the user's account but can later transfer that custody to the user on demand.

In the case of Reddit, the 2nd option fits best. As a user creates a Vault in the Reddit app, the backend can whitelist the user to cover that user's fees (up to a specific allowance).

Here are a few other usability benefits that users and developers will appreciate:

1. Fast, **1-second block times** with immediate confirmation and usually one or two blocks on top for finality provide experience that is matching non-blockchain systems.
2. NEAR has a native self-custodying web wallet which supports email and phone based account recovery and 2FA. This wallet is the first time that users can custody crypto without installing anything and without worrying about losing their device with keys on it. NEAR Wallet is launching on MainNet soon - [https://wallet.near.org](https://wallet.near.org/), but you can play already on TestNet - [https://wallet.testnet.near.org](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/)
3. Users can send tokens to their friends via a link, removing the requirement for their friend to know / install / create a wallet ahead of time. Read more in the [NEAR Drop](https://near.org/blog/send-near-to-anyone-with-near-drops/) blog post.

&amp;#x200B;

# Interoperability

Based on our knowledge, NEAR is the first Layer-1 that has **a working trustless bridge to Ethereum** (e.g. not operated by multisig but fully verifying chains on both sides). This allows developers to compose NEAR and Ethereum in various ways.

The simplest and applicable in the current challenge is transferring tokens from NEAR to Ethereum to interact with a broader ecosystem. Here are details of how ERC-20 &lt;&gt; NEAR Fungible token transfers would work: [https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge/blob/master/docs/workflows/eth2near-fun-transfer.md](https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge/blob/master/docs/workflows/eth2near-fun-transfer.md)

Additionally, NEAR is an open platform with its own ecosystem support: contracts, wallets, etc.

You can find details on how to build new contracts, integrate with various off-chain solutions and more in the documentation: [https://docs.near.org](https://docs.near.org/)

To check out examples of apps and contracts written in Rust ([most loved language based on SO](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3546337/rust-language-tops-stack-overflow-survey.html)) and AssemblyScript (language based on TypeScript that compiles to WASM) - [see examples page](https://examples.near.org/).

&amp;#x200B;

# Security

NEAR itself is an independent layer-1 protocol that is secured by stake of the validators.  Its unique account model creates several specific security benefits.

As described in the Usability section, the application designed for this demo gives users custody of their own assets and only they can authorize transfer of their tokens. The back end provides a process of registering new users but after that users can interact directly with the chain as long as they still have an allowance. This means that even if Reddit’s Backend is completely gone, users can still access their funds.

On NEAR, users can always add or change access keys to their account, even if the Reddit application gets attacked and exposes all the keys of all the users.  Thus, if they set up another wallet or recovery keys, the user can prevent funds from being stolen.

There are easy mechanics to setup 2FA and multisig and contract already available here - [https://github.com/near/initial-contracts/tree/master/multisig](https://github.com/near/initial-contracts/tree/master/multisig). Checkout [https://github.com/near/near-wallet](https://github.com/near/near-wallet) how this is used in production.

NEAR is available on [Ledger](https://github.com/near/app-near) now in development mode and soon should be released in general availability.

&amp;#x200B;

# Demo

Check out the live demo here: [https://near-reddit.digitalmob.ro/](https://near-reddit.digitalmob.ro/).  It is intentionally basic.  It shows what a user can do depending on their role.

For example:

1. Leslie Alexander \[user\] can see her account balance, transfer tokens to other users and award posts with tokens.
2. Deveon Lane \[moderator\] can do all of this plus minting new tokens.
3. Theresa \[owner\] can do all of this plus modify user permissions.

A simple throughput test which you can view in Theresa’s account processes a batch of transactions over 30 seconds, but this is mostly just a toy to see transactions show up in the explorer and verify liveness.

Hover over one of the cards on the main page (eg ""Throughput"") to link to **videos of each activity to quickly check out how it works.**

&amp;#x200B;

[NEAR Reddit demo](https://preview.redd.it/xa9as87018e51.png?width=2488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29954b4dfa073cb07aa3cb421e97fd2fc6d6618f)

&amp;#x200B;

# Demo Benchmark Costs and Speed

The demo costs for each transaction type were roughly:

1. **Mint:** 18 Tgas (10\^12) \* 100,000 yNEAR (10\^-24) per = 1.8\*10\^-6 tokens
2. **Burn:** 21 Tgas (10\^12) \* 100,000 yNEAR (10\^-24) per = 2.1\*10\^-6 tokens
3. **Transfer:** 22 Tgas (10\^12) \* 100,000 yNEAR (10\^-24) per = 2.2\*10\^-6 tokens

The spec asks for a combination of 300,000 mint, burn and transfer transactions, which would cost 0.6025 NEAR tokens.  If you assume for the sake of ease that a NEAR is $1, that's only about **$0.60 for 5 days worth of transactions.**

The benchmarked speed was approximately **200tps for one shard**. As noted previously, this number is misleading because it scales approximately linearly as the number of shards increase, which happens dynamically.

&amp;#x200B;

More how to build on NEAR you can learn in the developer documentation: [https://docs.near.org](https://docs.near.org/)

**Architectural Caveat:** The demo was architected for simplicity and convenience but also contains an unnecessary SPOF. It could have been architected differently to avoid that and take advantage of NEAR's ability for the central entity to pay for gas on behalf of the user (""option 2"" described above).  Please contact the NEAR team ([hello@near.org](mailto:hello@near.org)) for a walkthrough of how that works.

&amp;#x200B;

## NEAR's Status and Tradeoffs

NEAR launched MainNet POA earlier this year. Currently, NEAR is ironing out the last bits and pieces of the infrastructure before transitioning to a fully decentralized validator set, expected before the end of the summer 2020. More details can be found in this post: [https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-genesis/](https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-genesis/).

Contracts were deployed and benchmarked on decentralized TestNet that has similar set of validators to the ones that will run MainNet soon: [https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/reddit-token-contract-1596110508661](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/reddit-token-contract-1596110508661)

The current MainNet runs a single shard because no further scaling is required right now. When cross-contract calls are enabled, performance may dip slightly.  Countering this, almost no low-hanging performance improvements have been made to the runtime yet and are on the roadmap for shortly after the final MainNet release.

&amp;#x200B;

## Conclusion

NEAR provides an infrastructure to build an active developer community on top of Reddit’s incentivization and link it to Ethereum’s, without requiring the developer community of Reddit to learn new languages or learn about specifics of the infrastructure.

If you want to check out more NEAR apps, look at [examples](https://examples.near.org/) or explore [other apps that are open source](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/network/dependents).

What's different about tBTC

Bitcoin is already on Ethereum, most notably with wBTC, an ERC-20 token created by [BitGo](https://blog.bitgo.com/introducing-wbtc-the-power-of-bitcoin-with-the-flexibility-of-erc20-48c6681a9a7c).

Naturally, wBTC builds on its creator's strengths. BitGo serves as the custodian and lets anyone check its BTC balances against outstanding wBTC. But having a centralized, identifiable custodian could potentially introduce censorship risks in the eyes of some users.

Conversely, TBTC is an application built to allow trustless storage of the bitcoin backing tBTC tokens. To mint one tBTC, a user contacts the Keep network, which designates a wallet for storing the bitcoin. The keys for that wallet are held in a multi-sig structure across several nodes on the Keep network that have staked KEEP tokens.

_perks_,0.0,65.0," With numerous L2 solutions coming online, there's a very clear need for the industry to begin having open, widespread discussions around the tradeoffs that we're making by choosing one solution versus another. These decisions have consequences, and unfortunately, it's not enough for projects alone to understand the difference at this point in time; early adopters must as well.

It should be disclosed that I work for [Immutable](https://immutable.com/), who is developing a ZK Rollup scaling solution for NFTs. We've tried to eliminate bias in this post and be clinical in describing the differences between all solutions, but I encourage everyone to do their own research and engage in thoughtful discussion. This post is also centered around NFTs, but is equally applicable to other tokens.  

Everyone who uses, mints or trades NFTs on Ethereum knows that scaling is the key challenge facing the industry right now. The uniqueness of NFTs, a key part of their desirability, is also the very thing that makes them expensive and illiquid to trade on a blockchain with a limited capacity. Many teams are working extremely hard to give players and studios what they want: scalable, instant, and trustless minting and trading of NFTs. The purpose of this post is to help users and developers compare and contrast the various scaling strategies that have been proposed and built. The properties of these solutions usually have a direct impact on the security of your assets: **if you’re an NFT holder, it's important to understand where they are being stored!**

# Alternative Blockchains (Tron, Flow, EOS)

Alternative blockchains, which make different design decisions to ETH to prioritize throughput, are commonly proposed scaling solutions. This includes projects like Tron and EOS, which support general-purpose applications, as well as projects like Flow, which are targeting NFTs specifically. In general, the blockchain trilemma still applies: the only fundamental scaling boosts come from a reduction in security or decentralization or both. Nevertheless, this is a decision that comes down to individual applications: what makes sense for users of one game may not make sense for another.

However, with the rise of layer 2 solutions built on ETH, the key advantage of these alternative blockchains (scalability improvements) is under threat. Ethereum remains the largest smart contract blockchain in the world. It has built up enormous network effects and is the platform of choice for users and developers alike. It has significant ecosystem support: exchanges, wallets, fiat providers - even regulators are very familiar with Ethereum and how to interface with it. Building all this infrastructure from scratch while trying to compete with Ethereum's momentum will be a daunting challenge.

# Sidechains (Matic, Ronin, xDai)

Sidechains are separate blockchains that run parallel to Ethereum. They have their own miners (often called validators and operators), their own consensus algorithm, and their own bridge to transfer assets to and from the main chain (in this case, Ethereum). Users deposit by locking their assets in a mainnet smart contract. To withdraw back to Ethereum, users initiate an exit on the sidechain, then provide a proof of the exit once it is included in the side chain's history. 

Sidechains are very effective at general computation, and all EVM contracts can be ported directly to run on the sidechain, enabling ETH-like interoperability between contracts on each sidechain, as well as application-level logic. This makes them a common choice for NFT scaling, as applications can migrate with low overheads and development time.

However, sidechains, like alternative blockchains, usually relax Ethereum's security and decentralization in order to reach their desired scale. Users should be careful not to assume that their ETH assets, while in a sidechain, are just as secure as they are on mainnet: they are only as secure as the consensus algorithm of the sidechain. For sidechains with a limited number of operators and a vulnerable consensus algorithm (i.e. most of them), this could result in the complete theft or ransom of all user assets stored in the sidechain. 

Sidechains also often require additional tooling to be built to support the requisite level of UX.

# Plasma Chains

Plasma chains are a type of sidechain which avoids the security problems described above (at the cost of some scale) by publishing the roots of each plasma chain block on mainnet Ethereum. This ensures that (in theory) plasma chains directly inherit the security of the parent blockchain.

However, they have a significant disadvantage in that withdrawals from the plasma chain can take up to 2 weeks, as there is a requirement for a challenge period (‘exit game’) where users can report fraud. This dramatically impacts the UX of the system for users - explaining to mainstream gamers the complex reason they can’t access their assets immediately is an unenviable task. 

# State Channels (Efinity, Raiden)

State channels are a general purpose scaling solution which are most useful in interactions between a defined number of participants in a closed system. 

State channels require an opening and closing transaction on-chain, but all the intermediate states are sent directly between the parties (who both sign to indicate assent). Imagine a game of tic-tac-toe where we each sign off on each other's moves. If either of us claims we won unjustly, the other can produce the contradictory signature and force an on-chain arbitration.

Importantly, state channels need 100% availability of all the participants involved, or one user could publish an old state and claim it as the latest. If we're sending NFTs backwards and forwards between us, you can see the damage that might cause. The participants can use someone to represent them if they go offline, but this third-party could be bribed or attacked (particularly if one entity is fulfilling this function for the entire ecosystem). 

# Rollups

Rollups “roll up” large numbers of transactions into a big batch, then generate a “proof” for that batch. Using this proof, rather than checking each trade individually, we’re able to check the entire batch at once. Generally, users will deposit their assets into a smart contract on-chain, and their assets will be made available for instant trading in an off-chain environment. Users can subsequently withdraw back on-chain under certain conditions (usually waiting for a withdrawal batch to be published). These systems often allow the ‘operator’ of the system to censor transactions by not including them in batches, but give users the option to withdraw those assets back on chain to preserve user custody.

Rollups are the latest of the scaling technologies described in this post to reach “production-grade”. Last month, Vitalik Buterin declared that ""the Ethereum ecosystem is likely to be all-in on rollups as a scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future”.

# Optimistic Rollups (Optimism)

Optimistic rollups are “optimistic” because they assume that the proof provided for each transaction batch is valid. During a pre-defined challenge period (usually 1-2 weeks), anyone can challenge the submitted proof and assert fraud - these are therefore called “fraud proofs”. The advantage of optimistic rollups is that they easily support general computation: you will be able to copy/paste your mainnet Solidity code. 

However, they have significant limitations for scaling NFTs. Firstly, there is no possibility for fast NFT withdrawals - taking your NFT out of the system can require a 1-2 week wait. Secondly, in the event that an optimistic rollup is very successful and contains a significant amount of value, they can become a target for attacks, as the cost of stealing funds from the Optimistic Rollup is unrelated to the size of the potential theft - a penalty for the growth that we and others expect in the NFT ecosystem. 

# ZK-Rollup (Immutable X)

ZK-rollups use “validity proofs” rather than the fraud proofs described above, using either SNARKs or STARKs and plenty of complex mathematics to prove the validity of the transactions in the rollup. Using validity proofs means that once a proof has been accepted on-chain, users have immediate confirmation that those transactions were valid and are now immutable. In an NFT context, this solves both the problems identified with optimistic rollups above: users can withdraw immediately and no-one is able to attack the system, regardless of the amount of funds flowing through the system. In terms of scale, ZK-rollups have been able to reach speeds of nearly 10k transactions per second, and are capable of reaching much higher limits in future. 

The current disadvantage of zk-rollups is general computation: it is more challenging to port smart contract logic directly into the rollup, and therefore only limited functionality is available e.g. transfers and trades. However, with the fantastic work the StarkWare team is doing with CAIRO, zk-rollups will soon have parity in terms of general computation as well. 

# What did we choose? Why?

At Immutable we've been working in the industry for years on games like Gods Unchained. When comparing scaling solutions, we knew we wanted the following:

* Unlimited scalability
* Instant transaction confirmation and mainstream-quality UX
* No compromise on user security
* Retaining access to Ethereum’s ecosystem and network effects  
 

This made **our** choice easy: we built [Immutable X](https://immutable.com/) as a ZK-rollup in partnership with StarkWare. ZK-rollups are the only solution above capable of scale without compromise, and though they still have disadvantages in the area of general computation, those challenges are rapidly being resolved. When you build an application using a scaling solution, you are committing to that solution. We wanted to ensure we backed the winner not just for right now, but for years to come. 

We know the NFT ecosystem desperately needs scalability, and we are as an industry making a rapid transition to L2, even if it's not yet noticeable for end users. The decisions we make now will have security, scaling, and user experience implications for years to come, and I hope we begin to discuss it more as a collective ecosystem in between the degen memes.",ethereum,"Widespread understanding of L2 scaling tradeoffs is critical, here's an ELI5.",65.0,0.99
