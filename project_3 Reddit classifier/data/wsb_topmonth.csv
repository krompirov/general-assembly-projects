Also: **They borrowed 1,500,000** $GME Shares **to short yesterday (**[**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**, but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Millions of shares being sold short today, trying to get people to panic sell. DATA IS FROM 9:45AM.

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

&gt;""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

&amp;#x200B;

SEC FOIA Site: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

Data File: [https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip)

&amp;#x200B;

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

https://preview.redd.it/o2xfxx2gyuh61.png?width=581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d839f263c89c56f782a52803b11c9e5f4c9c8b

EDIT: Because so many people are bringing up XRT.  Which contains a lot of GME. Here is XRT.  Hmmm.  Notice anything interesting about Jan29th between these two??

https://preview.redd.it/kmbry5xzgvh61.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea1c495f4287932b0c6f9b172a04a03f58d147b

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ‚úÖ

&gt;In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ‚úÖ

&gt;As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Adding some historical counts for GME below.  I'm too lazy to combine the data right now, pulling from an older post of mine.

KitrosReddit,0.0,47467.0,"Alright, ya fucks, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

*If GameStop hits 800 before 2/26 we will trigger the Mother of All Short Squeezes*

As we learned from the last spike to 483, it was **not** the shorts squeezing. *As Melvin* ***admitted*** *in the Congressional Hearing that they did* ***not*** *cover and the spike was from* ***gamma****.*

If you do not know, this ""gamma squeeze"" occurs because of call options. As the prices surges, Market Makers are forced to write more calls and buy shares before they even become available, surging the price higher. 

So, now because we have fallen all the way back down to $40, we have a catapult cocked down as far as it can go, ready to be launched.

There are *millions, and millions, and* ***millions*** of shares written in those call options all the fucking way up to 800. These shares are not only buried in the 2/26 calls, but also every single date after this as well. ***So many fucking shares.***

If we can get to 800 and *all these calls become* ***in the money*** the Market Makers will have to scramble to buy millions and millions of shares that will surge the price up.

The craziest part is that this does not even take into account the shorts covering. So, as the Mother of All Gamma Squeezes squozes, sending the price into the thousands, the shorts will then also be skyrocketing the price at infinitely higher prices.

If you did not read my last dd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/) about GME short interest being 400%, we learned that u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME‚Äôs stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.*** 

Now, while I then believed this to be a completely outlandish number, I now believe to have realized that this gamma squeeze that will occur if we hit 800, ***is what it predicted.*** 

*To reiterate:*

*I believe that the AI-Model of GameStop's share price, which predicts $130k a share, is predicting this because it believes that we will hit 800 before 2/26, therefore causing the* ***M****other* ***o****f* ***A****ll* ***G****amma* ***S****queezes. Which will* ***then*** *trigger the infinity short squeeze which sends us to $100k+.* 

Many others are also starting to realize this as well, check out this post on r/stocks 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme\_gamma\_squeeze\_part\_two/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/)

While this is not financial advice, it is in my opinion that we need to do our best in holding and buying in order to get the stock price above $800 before Friday. This AI believes we fucking did it, lets prove the future right.

Shinai7047,0.0,41784.0,"I write this with a heavy heart, but I want to commemorate my father somewhere he can truly live on. 

My father was 57 years old, and had a lot of issues. Nobody really thinks about all the good things until someone is gone. My father wasn't a man of means, but during the early stages of my childhood fought hard to provide us an amazing life. And did so without ever really letting us know. 

After a divorce from my cheating bitch of a mother, after multiple back issues, multiple surgeries, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went downhill. 

I haven't gotten an official answer from the coroner since he's over 3 states away and it's all being communicated mostly through texts with his girlfriend right now, but honestly I'm not sure I want to. 

I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too. My father would've loved this cause and would've rallied with us till the end.

I had a cool ass dad and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass dad too. He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you're winners, or losers, or damn dirty apes. 

We love you dad. Thank you for believing in us.

Edit: 
1.)Thank you to everyone who has left me their condolences. Believe it or not, I attribute a lot of my ability to move past some of this because of your support. I don't have a great relationship with a lot of other members of my family, and my girlfriend has been great at supporting me through this as well. 

2.) Thank you for all the upvotes, even if you didn't leave a comment. I don't really care about the karma (as I pointed out to a few rude people here), but seeing that so many of you got to read the thread and appreciated my dad the way I did REALLY means a lot. Thank you for that. Also want to point out that I have been taking all of the coins I got from the awards (That I ALSO didn't really care to receive but they manifested nonetheless) and giving out awards to members of this subreddit for all of their devotion to the cause.

3.) I didn't realize I would be the one executing my dad's estate however after I wrote this post I started becoming inundated with calls and text messages from funeral homes, coroners office, investigators, and family members. To anyone who has not gone through this process before I would advise you to have the hard conversation with your parents and ask them what their final wishes are. While my father ( dubbed ""poppawallstreetbets"" by another user here) didn't really have much in that department I believe we have put together an arrangement he would be happy with. We will be having him cremated(which at least that part WAS vocalized), flying out to his home town in Carpenteria, California, and having his Ashes spread along the pacific ocean where he spent his younger years surfing before injuring himself. I have done my best to invite as many of his friends and family as I can. But for anyone in the immediate area, I invite you to attend as we finalize more of the details over the next 2-3 months. 

Again, thank you all for your support. As I see on here frequently, Ape Strong Together.

The-Crazed-Crusader,0.0,40928.0,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&amp;cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&amp;FORM=ANAB01&amp;PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",wallstreetbets,I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.,40928.0,0.81

OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR,0.0,37119.0,"Earlier today, Reddit Admins gave us the green light to bring back u/zjz to the mod team. It's hard to overstate how fantastic a development this is. 

Since the most recent mod shakeup, the entire team has been petitioning to bring zjz back. We wanted to keep you in the loop, but couldn't, because it might have hurt our chances of getting zjz back. We understand why this might have made you suspicious, but we're excited to put those suspicions to rest today.

Reddit Admins care deeply about the stability and continuity of the community, and so do we. At the end of the day, WSB is not defined by who is at the top of the mod list, it's defined by the conversations we create.

Even in the absence of zjz, we saw awesome discussions happening. Tons of great DDs, insane YOLOs, and beautiful, beautiful, gain and loss porn.

Now, with zjz back, we can take things even further. We can relax posting restrictions on account age and karma, which we use as proxies for post quality, and instead focus on the content of what's being said.

The truth is, I am very, very, optimistic about the future of WSB over the next 3-5 years. We have the absolute best mod team the subreddit has had since inception. Everyone who is part of a team now is someone that has played a big role of either the subreddit, or discord, community for years.

We appreciate your patience with us and the admins. We were all blindsided as we were thrown into this shakeup. No doubt mistakes were made at the beginning, but we're getting better every day to bring you the WSB you probably don't deserve.

But what I‚Äôve noticed is that no one seems to be mentioning the fact that Robinhood (and by extension the DTC)  LITERALLY HIT THE ‚ÄòOFF‚Äô SWITCH ON BUYS. That‚Äôs fucking right it was a great play before 28/1 even at 300 or 400. (If you bought at 300 after 28/1 you may actually be retarded)

The FUD campaign (or general memory loss from all the weed stonks) has made most of you forget that WE WERE FUCKING ROBBED.

As many of you know, on the 17th of this month, Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview (Automod won't let me link it?) where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze.

*However, this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined.*

Tom (or should we go with Tommy?) goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock, as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market. While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse, let‚Äôs play his game, and ponder this idea for a second.

Tom states without the regulation, brokers would have been obligated to deliver **270 million shares**, while only **50 million shares existed**. *540% of shares*.

Vlad, CEO of RobinHood, also told us that on the day of the halt they had an **order volume of 3 Billion**, that they could not fulfill.

Tom continues the interview, **admitting** that without the regulation, GameStop stock would have surged into the ***thousands***, yes plural.

*Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle, is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is.*

Finra‚Äôs latest short interest update gives us a value of 78.46%. However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now.

So, what is the true short interest then?

Well, let‚Äôs take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:

Insider Ownership: 23,704,787

Institutions: 151,000,000

Funds: 40,000,000

Retail: 38,595,000

Total Owned: 253,299,787

Total Outstanding: 69,746,960

Percentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%

Estimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827

FINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%

Finviz Float: 50,650,000

Reported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624

Total Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)

219,091,451

Percentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%

If you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024‚Äôs data, check out his DD.

***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \~432.56%.***

Last week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME‚Äôs stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***

Now, I know, lol. Let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. That is a completely crazy fucking number. I mean, right? It has to be?

But I mean, if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought, and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets. This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world.

If SI really is \~400%, shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights.

https://preview.redd.it/1xlj4jhdcji61.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d1ae42ae38e27ff4f6b2b82d8cfe2ffe52654610

If this is what *our* models show, imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have. This may very well be why they are so frightened. They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock.

All of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us. Without regulation, this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes.

So now, alongside our Dogfather Cohen, we shall wait patiently for a catalyst. Just like on the last squeeze to $483, we required a catalyst to get us there. Don‚Äôt forget the information we knew in November and December. Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of, Cohen could up his stake. Earnings in March. Who knows what could happen.

It is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world, and we are still in its infancy. Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not.

We are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.

So, continue to hold fellow apes. May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel.

üíéüôå

Edit: Also don't forget the other CNBC interview with our boy Tommy where he also **admitted** that they halted to **save themselves**. Or the CNBC interview with Vlad where he said it multiple times assuredly that it **WAS NOT** a liquidity issue, but that is his reasoning now. (You can find these 2 interviews on youtube, AutoMod wont let me link youtube)

There has been a tier 1 KILLSWITCH operation aiming to make GME disappear. And for many, it worked.

No longer is GME on the lips of every mother and father in the beautiful United States.

No longer is it the meme of the week, they want us to move on, forget about the stock, forget our fallen comrades at level 300, 400, 450...

But nay, We will never forget our fallen. I sure as hell haven't, and I am still holding on like a vice grip.

We cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won't do shit. Now his clown ass is desperately trying to do the same to those videos on YT as they have done to GME.  But the internet never forgets.

This is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares. ^(\*you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)

BUT I'm holding to the bitter end if it comes to that. I lost 88% so what's another 12% mean to me?

Nothing.

I am only writing this to find the ears of my fellow R-tards across the world who grow weak on this battlefield. We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.

My logic is this, I've read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I've gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.

Well hedgies... I SAY:

Wonderboi1995,0.0,19922.0,"Our father Autist Michael Burry (Burry if you read that don't be offended, we mean it as a term of endearment. You are our hero). Has called the next crisis. He posted a book on twitter that I will link here. I have just finished reading the book: The dying of money. Here I will attempt to summarise why he says the end is nigh.

I read the book so you didn't have to.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately I need to first explain some simple economics: but here goes... Most of you already know many of this stuff...you can skip a bit ahead. This first bit is for all the new retards we have recruited.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to stimulate the economy, America, and other governments, by way of their Central banks ‚Äòprint money‚Äô. They do this by buying their own governments bonds in the open market. They sometimes, as during the COVID crisis, buy corporate debt too. They actually, literally, ‚Äòbuy‚Äô this money with money they ‚Äòdigitally print‚Äô. That money comes from nowhere. (They add a liability and an asset to their balance sheet and boom- printed money).

Their intention is to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates. When you buy a bond, you push it‚Äôs price up, which then decreases it‚Äôs yield ‚Äì if that relationship confuses you, here is an example. A 1-year bond is trading in the market at 98$ (this bond has a par value of 100$), so you can buy the bond at 98$ wait a year and receive 100$. A nice 2/98 = 2%\~ yield.

Below, fed buys bonds, yields go lower.

&amp;#x200B;

[Yields fall as government buys bonds.](https://preview.redd.it/k5c2gmio6ej61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2519e2a3c5964b329dda0de9e05d03316876656)

If interest rates go down, businesses borrow more money to invest, and jobs are created because investments create jobs. But, if an economy is running at 2% interest rates then even investments yielding a meagre 2.5% would be invested in, because they can earn the difference \~0.5%...

**Why doesn‚Äôt the printing of money, by way of decreasing interest rates, cause inflation immediately?** Well, actually, it does. It creates inflation immediately in stock prices. The ‚Äòprinted‚Äô money doesn‚Äôt go to your average citizen, it goes to corporations who sell their debt to the Central Bank. It goes to big investors who sell their government bonds back to the Central Bank because they can earn more in stocks this way. They are clever, they know a   stock yielding even a stable 3% will earn them more than the current bond which only yields 2%.

# START READING HERE SMART AUTISTS!!!!!!!!!

**When does printing become a problem?**

The central bank looks at food prices, general household items, petrol prices, housing and other goods that the average you and me purchase almost every week. Bundle these together and call them CPI (Consumer price index) ‚Äì inflation. Inflation in **certain** goods.

Now let‚Äôs imagine a scenario. You have 100 people in an economy. 2 people are stinking rich and the rest get by fine but don‚Äôt have much extra to invest or save each month. They use their savings to purchase mediocre goods, a new bicycle, or a new TV. Why would they invest that extra $100, it‚Äôs too little a sum to have any affect, even in the long run, on their lives.

Now we look at the rich, they already have the TV, the car, a wife and a girlfriend and maybe a few houses. Where does their extra savings go? Straight into stocks. And maybe a new car every so often. Fine-dining and other sorts of things which **are not in the CPI (consumer price index)** basket.

&amp;#x200B;

**WATCH THIS:**

Mr Central banker comes along and prints an extra $1000. Give this money to the Rich man what will he do? He already has the car; he already has the houses. He will invest it straight into the market. Bam! Stock market inflation, stock market goes up. This is what has been happening since 2008 (you will see a graph further below that displays this process).

The extra 1000$ does not affect the CPI basket‚Ä¶The rich man is not going to suddenly eat twice as much or buy 10 more TV‚Äôs. The ‚Äústimulus‚Äù money from the Central bank inflates only the stock market.

Give this 1000$ to the poor-normal man, what will he do? He may treat his wife to dinner, buy his kid a bicycle that he couldn‚Äôt afford. Fill up his truck. Pay his rent. It is not that he is wrong to do this, this is most likely his best option. A meagre 1000$ in the stock market will have no effect on his life, even in the long term.

The point here, is that Central Bank ‚ÄòPrinting‚Äô does cause inflation, it causes inflation immediately in the stock market- because that‚Äôs where the money goes. Only when that money ‚Äòspills‚Äô into public hands (Think stimulus checks) does inflation in the ‚ÄòCPI‚Äô sense of the word, unveil itself.

**Inflation becomes a problem.**

Inflation becomes a problem when it isn‚Äôt accompanied by its good friend economic growth. Inflation, has an interesting effect of raising bond yields. Investors don‚Äôt want 2% bond yield if inflation is at 3%. So, they simple do this- they don‚Äôt buy bonds. What happens when someone doesn‚Äôt want to buy your house? You lower the price. No one is buying bonds? Bond prices go lower, and therefore yields rise. ‚Äì Remember if no one buys the bond the prices go from 98$ to 95$ (supply demand). At the end of the bond‚Äôs life, you get 100$, so the yield rises as the price falls.

**The inflation problem occurs** when the average man got his hands on some of that sweet government money. The poor man was able to effect CPI because he will actually purchase goods in the CPI basket. Give every poor man in America 1000$ they will go out and buy from a limited supply of goods. A limited supply of goods, supply demand and prices rise. Inflation ‚Äì CPI.

&amp;#x200B;

**What do we do?**

There are basically only two outcomes to this scenario:

1. If inflation in CPI, caused by the average American‚Äôs stimulus check, opening of the economy, increasing oil and commodity prices, gathers momentum, it will finally unleash the latent inflation potential of America. Everyone who holds dollars, or dollar denominated debt ‚Äì meaning every single country. Will pay for America‚Äôs inflationary sins. Fortunately, poorer countries who are indebted to America should actually benefit from this.

Under this scenario inflation will need to increase by this much (look at red line in graph):

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The red gap is the inflationary potential- The inflation that has not yet been realised but it does exist and needs to be realised eventually](https://preview.redd.it/zp2yb1r57ej61.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab58d80429b169749c0d3b868007983fb5889f5)

You can see that in 2008 the Central government began its shenanigans. In a stable economy, money supply should increase sort of in line with GDP. As you can see above money supply has increased far more than that. That gap, indicated by the red line, is inflationary potential. It now basically just sits in stocks.

Under this scenario, by my calculations, money supply needs to come back down to real GDP. The Central Bank won‚Äôt do this. They won‚Äôt tighten. That would hurt too much. But the naturally forces of inflation will do it for them. And prices in the economy will inflate to catch up with the money supply.

2) Scenario 2: A highly probable outcome: Japanification.

Japan has been doing QE for a much longer time than America. The reason why they haven‚Äôt blown up in an atomic bomb of inflation is because this money never reached the hands of the middle class or the poor. So that inflation couldn‚Äôt occur in CPI.

However, inflation did occur everywhere where the rich were. As it was them who had more access to this money.

America‚Äôs Central Bank could, by way of printing even more money, buy more bonds and push down yields. They could let inflation run for a little while and hope it doesn‚Äôt gain momentum. If inflation gains real momentum, which it could because they are giving money to the middle and lower classes, then they cannot follow Japans lead. If inflation remains muted and low. The real issues of wealth inequality will only persist and worsen.

&amp;#x200B;

It is not to say that the managers of these governments are inherently sinister in their motives to conduct QE, which disproportionately benefits the rich. It may just be the only way they know. And by human nature people would rather be instantly gratified, leaving future generations to pay for inflationary sins.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happens in scenario 1 summary:**

Inflation goes out of control (CPI inflation, stock inflation has already had its turn). Yields rise, Central Bank get‚Äôs spooked and tries to raise rates a little. Economy tanks due to raised rates. 6 months later or maybe a year later and the currency has found equilibrium by depreciating around 70% relative to the price of real goods- not relative to the price of other currencies. Or the currency has found equilibrium because they removed that money from the system-highly unlikely.

Stocks fall because yields rose. And everyone has the next best opportunity to invest into the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happens in scenario 2 summary:**

Inflation rises a bit due to stimulus checks. Central bank remains unconvinced that inflation will gain momentum. If inflation does not gain momentum the Central Bank will continue to print until they see GDP growth. Stocks go up but until the wealth gap is too extreme and a revolution takes place. This could take 10 years or 100 years.

SEC Data Show $359 Million of GameStop Shares Failed to Deliver
(Bloomberg) -- On Jan. 28, the day after GameStop Corp. mania hit its crescendo on the back of a short squeeze for the record books, about $359 million worth of shares were caught in limbo.

More than 1 million shares were deemed failed-to-deliver that day due either to buyers lacking cash to complete purchases or sellers not having the shares to settle trades, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data.

The SEC report, which covers trading from Jan. 15 through the end of the month, is just one more indication of the dislocation in the market for the video game retailer‚Äôs shares.

GameStop stock, for months among the most heavily shorted on the New York Stock Exchange, surged more than 1,700% from Jan. 1 through Jan. 27 as a legion of Reddit users piled on, forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading.

While the SEC‚Äôs list highlights the extent of the short squeeze, on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum, where the GameStop trade was galvanized, it‚Äôs evidence of something else: the unproven theory that hedge funds were engaged in naked short-selling of the shares.

Short sales -- when an investor borrows shares, sells them and then tries to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference -- are an everyday market occurrence. Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren‚Äôt known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.

‚ÄúFails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,‚Äù reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. ‚ÄúTherefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or ‚Äònaked‚Äô short selling.‚Äù

Failures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there‚Äôs also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.

One thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn‚Äôt be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop‚Äôs shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.

The data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a ‚Äúcumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,‚Äù according to the SEC‚Äôs website.

* Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.

* Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!

* Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.

#A note on the moderation team:

The team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.

This mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.

Making everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, stick around. You'll have a blast.

So I was just poking around randomly on Google. I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape-like conspiracy.

Short end of it, I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with.

Let me explain my thought process. Maybe I'm retarded but you apes help me to see if I'm crazy or autistic.

The real estate connection begins with this PDF document:

[https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb\_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf)

CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit.

The PDF starts off innocently. Just a thank you note, President's Forward and random ads.

But then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there's a strange coincidence.

Gamestop's real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.

Right underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.

I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn't seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol

But then I did some other digging and found a random document:

[https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0](https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0)

Which is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group's bankruptcy filing.

On page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:

GOLDMAN SACHS &amp; CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT

Idk if it's well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin's accounts.

I looked further into it and found:

[https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd)

**Custodian** Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC

Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.

And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory. I can't find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst:

[https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage](https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage)

So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris, Gamestop's regional leasing manager, Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 ([https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/](https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/)) and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially?

And then at that point word got around to Melvin who's probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it's a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop?

Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they've ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin's hard insider traded tendies.

It's a cooky theory but plausible.

Comment or message me if you have any more people or even vows from yourself and I will add to the list. Once each price mark is passed I will put a diamond on the people who promised to do stuff at that mark. Mods and tattoo artists, take note!

yodisc,0.0,18470.0,"As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options. 

**TL;DR** the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry. Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball.

**Here is what I did:** Pulled the option chain data into excel, ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info. 

**What is a gamma squeeze:** For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5. Gamma squeezes revolve around options, I wont go into too much detail here on what those are, but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is. Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per. Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers, biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago. They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM (in the money) of course, the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low. These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME @ $15 goes to $150... Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge, which of course will cause that price to rise more and more.

**Now that GME is @ $130:** Today was a great day, GME closed up $8.17 or 6.58% maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for, but on a down market day is pretty incredible. Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait.. 

# GME Options Exp. 2021-03-05 (This Friday)

**GME @ $100 (Last Fridays Close, Option Expiry):** At this level going into Friday we could expect **22,427** in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week. That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised. About **2,242,700** to be exact or about **4.97%** of the TOTAL FLOAT. Crazy. 

**GME @ $130:** We can expect **35,989** contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130. A solid **13,562** more contracts than at the $100 level. This equates to **3,598,900** shares or **7.97%** of total float. Now we're getting nutty.

**What about GME @ $150:** Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM. In fact, closing above this price means there would be **46,397** contracts ITM. This means that a whopping **4,639,700** shares or **10.27%** of total float. **MORE THAN DOUBLE @ $100**

**What does this mean?** Well not every contract will be exercised, even ITM. These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well. But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised, **10%** of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand, it means more contracts will come ITM next week, and then more again the week after and so on. With the steady price rise we've been seeing, it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge, COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation. What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME. There's been crazy volume at times, particularly today, the day before contract expiry. Any how, ill put away my tinfoil hat. What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning, the first domino's. 

Does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond? No not really, but it sure does increase the odds of that happening. We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves. We all saw what happened with RH, and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took, its just the action that we were able to see. 

**Summary:** Since last Friday (2021-02-26, last option expiry) the number of contracts possibly ITM has **DOUBLED** I repeat **DOUBLED.** If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised **10%** of total float will be called on. Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close @ $130 there is still **50%** more contracts ITM than last week. All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ill say it again for those in the back ***DOUBLED*****.**

I went into get tested for Covid this afternoon after being exposed, nothing special. But I'm also buying dips on AMC at the same time and as a result, almost missed my name being called multiple times by the receptionist when my turn was ready. Tunnel vision is real.

I get the swab and chat with the doc for a minute or two about all the Covid craziness and just overall life shit. He's a cool guy, super laid back and what not, and after a bit he steps out to go find my results. I'm chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I'm still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results. I didn't realize he could see the basic idea of what I was doing on my phone (price-watching etc) and as he passes me, I hear him say, ""Niiiiiice.""

Being in the exam room and awaiting my results, I chime in with, ""Oh sweet, I'm negative?"" He responds with, ""Nah, I saw the stonks on your phone. Good luck, retard."" There's a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he's here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.

Anyways, TL;DR: My doctor said ""good luck, retard"" while catching me buying dips on AMC and he's here somewhere in the WSB crowd.

HeyItsPixeL,0.0,14976.0,"Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!

&amp;#x200B;

First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**

&amp;#x200B;

**9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.

https://preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4

**9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that

https://preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22

**1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)

https://preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572

**2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.

https://preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31

**3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.

https://preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787

NOW THE ANALYSIS:

**WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**

So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.

**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**

Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.

https://preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb

**WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**

Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.

https://preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b

**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**

Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.

IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).

Quote: "" **Naked Short** ‚Äî This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation ‚Äì the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share ‚Äî instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

**Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**

On a slow day, as they were rounding a corner near a square, an IED was triggered sending the humvee into the air and catapulting him 60ft. They thought he was dead, and after securing the area realized he was alive. They flew him to Germany, then to Walter Reed, where he eventually wore up and was told he'd never walk, and that they had resected some of his lover and intestines.

After a year in a wheel chair, and working hard every day, he was able to walk again, then run. I remember him telling me he couldn't wait to get back to his unit. The Army medically retired him though, and he went into a deep depression, with which he struggled for a number of years. He eventually graduated from college with an engineering degree, but his accomplishments were overshadowed by his PTSD.

About 2 months ago, i showed him r/wallstreetbets and the dd that people were doing on the gme stock. He YOLO'd his savings and sold half at 302,giving him enough to pay off his mortgage! E talk everyday, and he just got an amazing job 2 weeks ago doing R&amp;D in his major. He is focused, heavily invested in gme, and doesn't care what the price does.

Here is the list if anyone is interested, it covers everyone with positions over $30m. I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere, but wanted to make sure (as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself). As always, this is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is said that if you **know your enemies** and **know** yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not **know your enemies** but do **know** yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not **know your enemies** nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.

&amp;#x200B;

This then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME. Surprise, it's all the same people, guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story. Thing is, even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, some of these guys have very big positions against.

Biggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there. These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category.

If you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up, just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations. What you have got remember, is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions, the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect. Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge.

You also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there, mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful.

If you can't be bothered to look at the information below, the big bosses are Melvin, Citadel and Susquehanna (SIG). I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna (SIG) might be the final boss. Guess what? Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel.

Edit: Guess who also owns 4,225,900 of puts totalling $85,448,000 and 4,196,299 of calls totalling $84,849,000  in RKT, you are right Susquehanna. Big thanks to the u/[Dadri88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dadri88/) below for this.  Guess who else also has a big position in RKT, yep, just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel.  $59,770,000 in calls and $37,189,000 in puts. If I had a really big hedge fund, maybe I would put puts and calls on a company, push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility. Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing......

Let me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture. The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on decision making under conditions of uncertainty. SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool. The company employs Bill Chen, a World Series of Poker star, in its quantitative trading group

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting ""real DD"" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling ""MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS""

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) ""$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE"" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&amp;#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on ""overall strength""
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST ""SENTIMENT"" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&amp;#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.

&amp;#x200B;

*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**

**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in. Just be done with the trade afterwards. You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one, unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago, and in that case, you belong here, congrats on your gains and fuck you.**

**THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE. AND IT WILL END. THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER.**

And if you think *WE* are the ones driving the price up, the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want. You're holding a lit molotov, the only question is: will you throw it before it blows up?

The rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the ""HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW"", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the ""movement"" and ""lets push this to the sky"" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**

***You know what ""lets push this to the sky"" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.

**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**

# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.

Positions: I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC. I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1,000 tomorrow, and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent.

Disclaimer: I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** You know what I forgot to add? Some of the biggest holders, the cannabis ETFs and funds, you know what they did today? They trimmed their positions. And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de-concentrate shares into the retail's hands, the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent.

**Edit 2:** Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill, [https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC](https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC) \- I had thousands of shares, these are just the trades from this month, and I'm not advocating a buy, I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in. You want the gain numbers? You do the math, I'm not your math tutor, I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them. I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb.

*Yeah, I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later, that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person.*

**Edit 3: I'm getting piles of messages from people who used to follow my DD back in 2018/2019. Yes, it's the real SoRefreshing, proof:** [**https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe**](https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe)

I only played shares.

Several people, people pretending to be normal WSB members and then after a few reddit messages informing me they have been in finance for 25 years (going as far as creating new accounts to try and talk to me) Others who have been trying to identify me on Reddit, and asking for me to either email them or call them, and even meet up. Dont engage these people

MY message to these people. Do you think I'm stupid? Anonymity is my friend at this point. We all have seen what happens to users like DFV once you get a name and a face.  Stop trying to threaten people or identify then for money.


Yes I made money. Deal with it. No need to try and scare and threaten someone on the internet.
No one in my life other than my wife knows about the money anyway.

I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I‚Äôm an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). ‚ÄúFailures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling**.‚Äù

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, ‚ÄúAbusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago‚Ä¶ Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**‚Ä¶ We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market ‚Äì it is undermining it.‚Äù** Mr Cox also ‚Äúreferred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales‚Äù as ‚Äú**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman‚Äôs words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‚Äò**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price‚Äô**‚Äù. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye‚Ä¶ DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, ‚ÄúDepository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal ‚Äú**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn‚Äôt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn‚Äôt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would‚Äôve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**‚Ä¶ Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply‚Ä¶ Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.‚Äù** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I‚Äôve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to ‚Äúcover‚Äù their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may‚Äôve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

Yonsei,0.0,11191.0,"Alright apes and autists, let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze. If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.

On November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled ""Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers"". In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.

**The Mission Statement**

""GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \[...\] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services.""

**The Landscape**

* Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry
   * ""The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.""
   * ""The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023.""
* Valuable Assets
   * Existing ""strong brand"" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.
   * ""Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.""
   * Large retail and physical footprint.

**The Roadmap**

* Evolve into a Technology-first company
   * ""Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another.""
   * GameStop will have to ""begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers."" (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)
   * GameStop will have to ""hire the right talent."" (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).
* Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform
   * ""Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors."" (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)
   * Provide and expand ""larger gaming catalogs"" (Capture all games)
   * Create ""community experiences"" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)
   * Provide ""streaming services"" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)
   * Support ""Esports"" (Expanding scene that is not going away)
* Transition to Digital
   * ""Industry developments in recent years"" include ""transition from physical hardware to digital streaming"" and the ""explosion of mobile.""
   * Expand ""digital content."" (This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)
   * Allow ""online trade-ins."" (This would be a game changer)
* Cut Excessive costs
   * ""Cut its excessive real estate costs"" and ""identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.""
   * Streamline ""Non-core operations in Europe and Australia \[...\] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash.""
   * ""Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future.""

**The Financials**

Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:

* GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.

Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.

**The X Factor**

I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that ""RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability."" With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.

Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon‚Äôs customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.

Furthermore, I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.

So degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.

P.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.

In this post, I‚Äôll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. I‚Äôll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. 

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I don‚Äôt believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck ‚Äúdiamond handing‚Äù, I‚Äôm **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how I‚Äôm trading GME.

# Important External Reading

These three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**

# History of shares and shorts on $GME

Here‚Äôs some history on GME that‚Äôs worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. 

* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. 

&amp;#x200B;

[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GME‚Äôs share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)

* **GME used to be in the S&amp;P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **It‚Äôs very likely GME was shorted out of the S&amp;P.** 
* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/axl9ipwqw2i61.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd2743962405738469193d7e6c59d3068f1f8d78

* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772

* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  
* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. 
* **There are many strange connections between DTCC‚Äôs actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood‚Äôs head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhood‚Äôs users had GME. 
   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.
   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a ‚Äúturn off buying or else‚Äù kind of arrangement. 
   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesn‚Äôt care about shooting down Robinhood. It‚Äôs a minor toe amputation to save their leg. 
   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it 
      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, you‚Äôd know something interesting.** 

# Why GME went up

* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. 
   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When there‚Äôs **high trading volume relative to total float**, it‚Äôs easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. 
   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) 
   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: 
      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was
      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more
      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them
      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME 
   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. That‚Äôs why GME shot up. 

# The Big Reset

This wasn‚Äôt just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. 

* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). It‚Äôs very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. 
* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. 

# However, this is not the end for GME

* Everything started with value on GME
   * At $50, we‚Äôre back to a value play. GME‚Äôs market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)
   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, we‚Äôre not too far off from that right now. 
   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink 
* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) 
   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. He‚Äôs likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he‚Äôs going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. 
      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen‚Äôs 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. 
   * **Regulatory involvement.** It‚Äôs really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. 
   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think it‚Äôs unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. 
   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didn‚Äôt realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. 
      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhood‚Äôs instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** 

# How I‚Äôm thinking about GME now 

This is going to sound extremely strange, but **I‚Äôve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I can‚Äôt wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadn‚Äôt bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but I‚Äôm slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. 

None of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of ‚ÄúGME is another blockbuster destined for death‚Äù is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. 

Since part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). 

I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I don‚Äôt think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** 

That being said, I‚Äôm hoping for a further dip. I‚Äôm **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. 

# Suggestions 

This is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. 

Here‚Äôs some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. 

* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **that‚Äôs a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So I‚Äôm selling calls against my remaining shares. 
   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that don‚Äôt sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of ‚Äúpennies in front of a steamroller‚Äù but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**
      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). 
      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. 
      * Two scenarios:
      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that ‚Äúcan‚Äôt go tits up‚Äù.
      * ‚ÄúDownside‚Äù risks:
* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - don‚Äôt fomo. 
* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it‚Äôs an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn‚Äôt resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you‚Äôre taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and don‚Äôt pay you for it, margin call you when you‚Äôre winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúfree‚Äù commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.
* **Minimize regret; don‚Äôt maximise profitability.** I sold some shares ‚Äúearly‚Äù on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for ‚Äúmaximum profit‚Äù led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.
* **Don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose.** I‚Äôve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I‚Äôve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It‚Äôs common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you‚Äôve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Don‚Äôt sell on dips.** You‚Äôre only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it‚Äôs heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I‚Äôm holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.

# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?

On February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions I‚Äôd love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. 

## Dear Vlad,

1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?

2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?

3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?

4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME

5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GME‚Äôs price rise again to $500/share or more? 

## Dear Kenny G,

1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?

2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?

3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?

4) What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th?

5) Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME

6) Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th?

## Dear Plumpkin,

1) Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity

2) Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019. Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe? If so, please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40% of GMEs float was bought back

3) Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt

4) Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital? If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th

5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital

6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?

7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?

8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME

9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise

10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-""R""-T when they closed their short gme positions

11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts. With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with?

WSB is a toxic community, we pride ourselves in it. It‚Äôs kind of like how when your dad says ‚Äúshut up retard‚Äù what he really means is I love you son. (Well maybe he really does mean you‚Äôre retarded and wants you to shut up) 

I digress‚Ä¶ Anyways, with a community of over 9 million users it would be almost statistically impossible that there **isnt** someone here who has lost a lot of money, has made a huge mistake whether it be from just misunderstanding, or trading on emotions and is really battling with suicidal thoughts. 

I just want to let you know that I and many others are here for you, you can message me anytime my inbox is open. Your life isn‚Äôt worth a loss of money, let me say that again. **Your life isn‚Äôt worth any amount of money.** There are people that care about you way more than they care about your money. Things will get better. You will make it through. Message me or anyone else who volunteers at any time. I for one am here to listen if you need anything.


Edit: I meant to say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre life isn‚Äôt worth taking over any amount of money.‚Äù It was late for me.

 To all of those who have reached out to help with those reaching out for help I appreciate it.


Also, thanks for the awards much appreciated

Side note: Before you make large financial decisions make sure you know what you‚Äôre doing. WSB doesn‚Äôt tend to offer help to newer users as that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs designed for.

2. The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.
3. Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.
4. Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post negative comments/posts.
5. GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.
6. The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.
7. Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.
8. As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days.  Don't be afraid that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't. 
9. Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce its impact if you day-trade.
10. THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED. IT IS A GAME OF TRUST.

&amp;#x200B;

100K/SHARE MINIMUM. (And that's only a checkpoint).

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get caught in their FUD, they are trapped in a corner and are doing everything they can, legal or not, to limit their losses. Finish them.

Most importantly : I will not sell under 100k. This is the play of a lifetime, this could change my entire life, I could buy a house, and help others. I'm not ruining my only chance.

Turtlesaur,0.0,10134.0,"Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‚Äò08 ‚Äò09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He‚Äôs working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his ‚ÄúBiden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment‚Äù which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it‚Äôs truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. ‚Äú..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn‚Äôt even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

Hey my fellow apes,

I bought into GME high. I got into GME at 10 shares @ \~$300. On Friday Feb 5th, after market close, I decided I was just gonna call it a loss and close my position in GME the following Monday at market open. That Saturday, I drove 4 hours home and surprised my mom at my aunts house.

My aunt put together a birthday dinner for my mom and I thought it would be a nice surprise for her to see her son on her b-day. It was a fun party. We ate, drank, and played games into the evening. At one point though, my aunt remembered something.

She and her spouse moved her old ass couch out of her home to the dump the previous week. In the process of moving however, she found a wallet inside.

The wallet was my first wallet ever. It still had my 7th grade student ID card, locker combination, and class schedule inside. What really made my testies tingle though was the Gamestop Value card that was inside.

Of all the times over the last 15 years that this wallet could have been found, it remained hidden until the very time I needed it most. If this wasn't a sign from God or w/e you do or don't believe in, I don't know what is.

Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, üåàüêª keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

""I wish I bought at $9..."" - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $11..."" - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $17..."" - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $40..."" - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $60..."" - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy‚Äôs Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aim√© of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the üåàüêªs**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded.

**Total Shorted Shares =** **~~79,915,483~~**  **57,231,935**

This is Total Shares owned by Institutions - Total Shares Float. Which means 46.9% of the 122,566,784 shares are shorted.

**Short % of Shares Outstanding =** **46.69%**

This is Total Shorted Shares √∑ Total Shares Outstanding x 100.

&amp;#x200B;

**My speculation (Don't take financial advice from me radarada I'm not a professional etc):** The increase in shorted shares since last month is because they're shorting GME to prevent eF-T-Ds (Failure to deliver) for the first bunch of shorted shares. **They're SELLING OUR SHARES BACK TO US to cover the original shares they owe us** until either we give up or **WE STOP BUYING** and allow the eF-T-Ds to come into action and they start **HAVING TO BUY THEM BACK**.

Let's say they borrow your share and sell it to another retail investor for current shareprice of $100 then they buy a share for $100 too and then give it back to you. So they're basically increasing the share volume and covering their earlier shorts without paying a dime so that it doesn't cause eF-T-D. They could technically do this infinitely unless maybe government regulations intervenes?

It doesn't matter if the price drops, just hold your shares, you don't need to buy, you need to HOLD OR PLACE A SELL ORDER FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT YOU WANT TO SELL $1000+, $100,000+, whatever you want. The share price may drop (even if they continue doing ladder attacks) but the moment they start buying from the actual shareholders again, the price will rise extremely fast. If we all want to sell at $1000 then it will rise to $1000 immediately, it's just whatever an actual shareholder wants to sell at. And proof is in the pudding that majority only want to buy or hold.

YOU CAN BUY OR NOT BUY. IT DOESN'T MATTER EITHER WAY, WE STILL CHOOSE OUR SELLING PRICE. If we stop buying then eF-T-D kicks in and they have to buy back shares at whatever price we want. If we keep buying then also that's good but just means it's a longer game and the pressure is going to be worse for them unless government or DTCC intervenes and forces them to close. Also worst case scenario for this whole thing is if hedgies do go bankrupt from this or Failure-To-Deliver and fined, then we still get our money from [clearing party](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/quadrillion-dollar-corporation-at-the-heart-of-the-financial-system-20150707-gi6w7b)/broker. Basically we are win/win, set your desired sell price.

His company RKT mortgage literally smashes every ER by a country mile and hes tired of his stock being held down by these spineless cowards. [Farner is actively going to war with them Elon style.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-ceo-not-stock-174605720.html)

Let me outline how this mega-autist CEO is going to force the **shorts to squeeze themselves by 3/9.**

Farner, along with company founder Dan Gilbert, and the leadership team own 95% of Rocket Companies.

* Theres currently 113m shares outstanding
* 38% of those shares are short
* CEO/Founder own 95% of the 2B float ( note this for later )

So a quick math lesson tells us:

38% of 115m = \~ 43 mm shares short

**NOW THE FUN PART**

In their most recent investor meeting team $RKT rolled up to the shorts door like the dancing pallbearers and introduced a $1.11/share SPECIAL DIVIDEND to be paid to anyone holding RKT stock by 3/9.

So.. what does this mean for shorts? Weve arrived at the BDE moment..

**SHORTS HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDEND**

Shorts have to pay $1.11 for every share they are short on 3/9

BUYBACK PROGRAM

What else was in that juicy investor conference? Wait for it‚Ä¶

**$1 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK PROGRAM**

See, RKT makes so much fucking money they can afford not only a special divi, but a $1B share buyback. Im telling you this man is going into the trenches and clearing the shorts out by his fucking self.

**TLDR:**

$RKT has been suppressed for way too fuckin long, the company owns 95% of the shares and Jay Farner/Dan Gilbert hate shorts and they have diamond fuckin nuts, they aint sellin. Shorts have to cover their 43mm shares or they are **forced to pay $1.11/share they are short on 3/9**.

Also, if you can‚Äôt do math. If u buy shares and hold thru 3/9.. it‚Äôs an instant 5% return via the special dividend.

WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE üöÄ SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so I have updated to include today‚Äôs data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading üòâ

\------------

**Part 1: FINRA**

I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)

There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.

The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.

**CAVEATS:**

* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t
* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.

**Assumptions used:**

GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)

GME Total Shares: 69,750,000

https://preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74

The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!

\----------

**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**

Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.

The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker‚Äôs FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).

Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.

https://preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9

Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.

\----------

**Part 3: ETFs**

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274

[https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)

They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).

&gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).‚Äù

If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).

NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF

\----------

**TLDR:**

THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **üíéüôå** üíé will prevail!!!

**Stake:** shares in GME **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ**

**PS:** you guys! I‚Äôm truly honored by how popular you‚Äôve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an ü¶ç could ever want! I‚Äôll continue to post updates on this data next week :)

For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""

Here are the facts:

1) **Mark Cuban raised a very valid point.** 

If you are investing in a company, the way we *used* to, as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company, then prices going down is a good thing. Cheaper cost of entry / position expansion. 

2) **GameStop is poised to d.o.m.i.n.a.t.e. the space within the gaming industry.**

Looking to build Esports arenas? Guess what, gyms are going out of business left and right. Cheap real estate.

Dedicated gaming streaming channel? Disney and others are already on that bus for their niches, so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming, would be no surprise. I'm not talking about livestreams, I'm talking about *produced* content.

Speaking of live, Twitch? Discord? Already set up, and instead of competing, GameStop could literally just *buy* these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord (or leave them as is, just own the revenue streams).

There are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub (epicenter, really) for such a massively exploding industry (an industry with zero sign of slowing down. Ever). 

Entertainment as an all-things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable, and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly. *Interactive* entertainment is just unrivaled.

3) **The man, the legend, the boyfriend to all of our wives, DFV/Roaring Kitty/Mr. G, just doubled his shares position.** He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock, and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values (remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up? I didn't do the math, and I'm not gonna, but I'd be willing to bet money that he didn't turn 100% of those profits into shares anywhere near the top).

Because of this, he has negative downside risk (GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead). I'm in a much *much* smaller, but similar boat. I made $100K, and kept 100 shares, which I fully intend to take to my grave. This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place.

4) **GameStop will never be forgotten.** This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time. The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon. Even if there are not new regulations / trade taxes, the world will always *always* remember ""G.M.E.""

5) **I am just fine, financially.** My small business generates $100K to $250K/year in revenue. This is not a YOLO play. I can afford to lose the money I am putting in. Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance. See above, where I discuss proceeds and how they won't exist, so there's no money anyway.

--------------------------------

**The Plan:**

- Buy *as many shares* as I can afford, never expecting to see that money ever again.

- Sell a few covered calls way in the future, at or out of the money. As they approach expiration, roll them forward another year. This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops, or secure (and yes, limit) upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value. As long as these options do not get exercised, I will still own the shares. I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25-35% cash ROI every year (see below somewhere).

- As I earn more money externally, buy more shares. Again, as many as I can afford. Every. Single. Year. Just constantly expand my position. No matter what. Forever.

- ????

- Profit, never. Not ever sell a single share. Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to, you guessed it, buy more shares.

------------------------------------------

Remember, my goal here is to own shares, not to make money. Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares. Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares.

Currently at-the-money covered calls expiring 1/21/22 (about a year out) are effectively worth 35-40% of the value of the stock. Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY, then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35% each year. Yes, there will be a decrease in IV in this case, but using externally-earned money I should be able to make up the difference.

------------------------------------------

- **First milestone:** overtake u/DeepFuckingValue in share volume. I will never beat his % gains, and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns, but that is fine. My goal is purely share count. 

- **Second milestone:** overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume. My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares. I haven't dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type ""ryan cohen gamestop shares"" and I'm not gonna. Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated. I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone, as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life, before I get old and die.

- **Third milestone:** Own, run, and manage GameStop. Whatever that means. Member of the board, sure? Bust in on meetings like ""Hey I own most of this place, someone grab me a coffee."" and then yell about how ""I pay your salary!"" as I'm being escorted out by security, more likely. But I'm not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table, even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old, or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt.

------------------------------------------

With this strategy, cumulatively expanding my position by 35% YoY, I should be able to turn a 1,000-share portfolio into a 8million-share portfolio in 30 years. This is just based on current prices, options values, and my current income.

It couldn't bother me less if it goes to $1, $0.50, or $0.25 per share. At a certain point, cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock.

I like this stock, and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success.

------------------------------------------------------

The **only** disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan (it's not even a strategy at this point), would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised, calling all my shares away from me, increasing my net worth by 35% all at once. 

Or if GME just does really well organically, which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares.

Becoming a millionaire would be cool and all, but I'm trying to do something specific here.

SEC interns: I'm just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone. I just like the damn stock.

Hedgies and MMs: please crank up your algos to maximum. Never stop doing what you're doing. I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY.

Current üíéüôå shareholders: you are the only thing standing in my way, and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y'all's meme-ass prices. If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits, I will thank you for it. If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it (maybe shoot for buying back in lower), I'd appreciate that even more.

----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I'm going to be updating y'all weekly or monthly or annually, whatever. Might be a little bit to get started, as I'm currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better. But hey, I have 30 years to get this sorted out, right?

Make fun of me as I lose money. Ask me for advice as I make money. Call me an idiot for the platforms I use. Try to sell me access to your crappy web-based indicator research tools. None of it will matter. Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin-toss of whether or not GME becomes 'fundamentally' valuable, I suppose.

edit 2: To clarify a few things for those who apparently can't sense where some choice satire/irony/sarcasm is within this post, as well as those who straight up can't do math:

- **Anyone who didn't chuckle at least a little bit at ""Gwitch"" and ""Gamescord"" is for sure dead inside.** 

Yeah, Twitch may be out of reach, but check out the timelines of Twitter adding pics, Instagram adding videos, and Vine existing (yes, vine is dead, but TikTok took over that vibe). I guarantee you something will be the ""Next Twitter"" or the ""Next Instagram"" or the ""Next Tiktok"". It likely will not literally replace these things, but it *will* provide the next thing users want that hasn't been addressed. And it will grow too big to get back the audience these 3 giants will have lost. Something similar *could* happen with gaming. And if GameStop makes it (or buys the small service outright before they get too big to be bought), then the prophecy will have come true.

- **Sick burns, everyone.** 

I have not laughed this hard reading comments here since I first discovered WSB. I absolutely love you guys. The adderall bits in particular are gold. Yes, I am at baseline as of writing this stuff (my baseline is high as a my risk tolerance). Apologies for the length and lack of formatting and emojis. This was really just supposed to be for me to point at later when people are all ""Why exactly are you doing this?"" on future posts. As Blaise Pascal said, I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.


----------------------------------------------------------


edit 3: **Okay, basic math time.** Yes I calculated this with what few crayons I had not eaten, so y'all can relax and let me do the reeeeing for you:

If you have $100 and you make 10% return, you then will have $110. If with that new amount ($110, you following?) and you make another 10% return, now you have $121. Now I know it seems like you should have $120, and some of you seem to think that in order to turn $100 into $121 that I would have to add $21 of my own money from somewhere else. But this is the magic of how % ROI woks and a little thing called *cumulative* returns.

Okay, gonna keep this in dollars for a moment, just so you guys can follow and I don't lose anyone (though it seems many of you stopped reading at ""Gwitch"" anyway, and those are probably the only people here who could follow this elaborate and complex algorithm).

Let's say you own $1,000 and you can make 35% returns each year, for 30 years. This would be calculated as $1,000 x 1.35^30. Type that into a calculator and you'll get over $8Million. Trust me, and trust your calculator. This isn't magic. It's investing.

Now, if you own 1000 share of a company, and you call sell call options on those shares for 35% of the value of said shares, then it *does not matter* what the share price is (as the price goes up, so does the value of that call option, as the price goes down... surely you get it by now). If you quickly reinvest that money into the *same shares* at the *same price* then you will have increased your holdings by 35%. On a yearly basis, assuming the stock value ends at or below your strike price by expiration, *and* assuming the IV remains high enough to do it again the following year, then you could just do it again once that all expires worthless. Only now you can do it with 1300 shares (1400, if you go ahead and just buy 50 more). At this rate, you would theoretically end up with 8 million shares at the end of 30 years.

If you can secure 5% more shares cumulatively on a *weekly* basis, without them ever getting called away from you, would own over 323 million shares within 5 years.

**tl;dr (for real real this time)** If the stock literally ends every week lower than the previous week, and ends every year lower than the previous year, forever (**and** assuming the volatility remains high *or* that I can make up the difference via infusions of cash externally)... Then I'm gonna own all of GameStop somewhere between 5 and 30 years from now. If the stock goes up consistently, especially if it goes up significantly, then it will be very difficult to accomplish this. Because math.

I'm late to GME and bought into the hype. Every day I've been tracking GME and got really close to selling, but before I sold, I decided study u/deepfuckingvalue activity for insights into why GME. I found a comment about that locked me in and want to discuss with you retards.

The news screams at us that the market is over valued. Time and time again a company has $40bn market cap on a measly $2bn revenue with $500mm profits. Who in their right minds would say a company is worth $40bn when it would take 80 years to see ROI. OVER VALUED TRASH. Even UBER report billions in losses but institutional investors are still riding a wave on overvalued trash, why shouldn't we do the same? 

GME is a good buy compared to loads of other OVER VALUED trash on the market. 

&gt;People talk up the demise of GameStop yet here they are about to generate over $2b in revs in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle. - u/deepfuckingvalue 

$2bn in revenue in a quarter is not bad. In 2020, GME had revenues of $6.5bn with $300mm in losses down from $8.3 revenue with $491mm in losses in 2019--their worst year since each year before they were turning a profit. Amid a global pandemic GME manages to hold onto revenue and contain losses, they even came close to a profit in Q420 with only $20mm in losses down from $84mm in Q419--amid a global pandemic with Q420 ending in October and not including holiday sales.

Look at UBER and SNAP. In 2020, UBER had $14.15bn in revenue AND $8.6 BILLION IN LOSSES yet currently $113bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. Or SNAP. In 2020 it had $2.5bn in revenue, $945mm in losses and currently has $94bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. 

If GME is over valued trash like these smart buys then it must be valued at $100bn, maybe $50bn. But wait, GME market cap rests at a modest $3.4bn. WTF?? So you mean to say GME's revenues are 2x its stock market value while closing in on losses but UBER and SNAP are killer buys with $100bn market cap with no end to their bleeding $$. THE EXPERTS SAY ITS BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL!!!

&gt;The ‚Äúshift to digital‚Äù thesis is way overblown. - u/deepfuckingvalue

The financial news screams at us saying digital has killed brick in mortar, blah blah blah, we live inside computers now--see PROOF we are on WSB ALL DAY!! If brick and mortar were dead then why would Amazon purchase Whole Foods? Why do companies like PELOTON have retail stores ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? Why did e-commerce sales only represent 11% of all retail sales in the US in 2019? BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS WAY OVERBLOW BULLSHIT THEY FEED US.

GME has losses, sure, but they are containing costs with revenue exceeds their entire stock market value. GME is bringing in loads of $$ and their nearly contained losses are way under leading trash-buy stocks like UBER and SNAP. Brick and mortar is alive even in a pandemic--just wait until after the pandemic. People like to visit shops and get their buy on quickly--that's why AMZ bought Whole Foods and online retail only represents a fraction of brick and mortar retail sales. GME is not going anywhere anytime soon. GME is undervalued compared to the rest of the trash on the overvalued market. That's why I'm holding, will stop looking at the ticker price, and will no longer join in discussion about GME on WSB.

**Yes, there is a US company with assets of $63 trillion that you haven't heard about.** That's a problem. And it's time this company that's relevant to the $GME scandal testify to Congress. The People demand to know if the system is working fairly for all.

**Their name:** The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (""DTCC""). *See* [*https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance*](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance). **They claim the ""\[t\]otal value of active issues held at DTCC"" in 2019 was $63 trillion.** Simply put, they hold your stocks. That year, they settled $120.80 trillion in securities transactions alone.

**What do they do**: Not much - other than **settle almost every securities transaction in the United States.** In an SEC Sample Offering Document, DTCC claims themselves to be ""the world's largest securities depository."" *See* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995\_ex10-3.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995_ex10-3.htm).

**Why DTCC matters**: Robinhood relies on their subsidiary, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (""NSCC""), to help clear their trades. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/). Here's a good explanation of what they do: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/).

In a document on the US Treasury's website, it states the DTCC's shareholders are many banks:

""DTCC is a holding company of DTC, FICC and NSCC, which are independent legal subsidiaries. There is a single governance structure for the three clearing agencies. DTCC governance arrangements are available publicly and updated on a yearly basis (last update October 2009). **DTCC common shareholders include approximately 362 banks, brokerdealers, mutual funds and other companies in the financial services industry participating in one or more of DTCC‚Äôs clearing agency subsidiaries, including NSCC.""** *See* [https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP\_DAR\_Settlements\_NSCC\_Final\_5%2011%2010.pdf](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP_DAR_Settlements_NSCC_Final_5%2011%2010.pdf).

Let's get this straight, the shareholders of DTCC are the banks? They govern a $63 trillion company (in terms of asset worth, not valuation (come on, people, I know the difference)), by which its subsidiary inadvertently halted meme stock trading on? **How is this not a conflict of interest to the integrity of the free markets?**

To be clear, I don't know who these banks are. Can't find them. That seems *interesting*. One internet article claims ""DTCC‚Äôs user-owners include: Citigroup, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Virtu, Barclays . . . Mellon, Bank of America."" *See* [https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing](https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing). I couldn't verify this.

Better yet, read this email by Murray Pozmanter, the Managing Director - Head of Clearing Agency Services and Global Operations at DTCC, dated Feb. 1, 2019. First, he states that ""DTCC is the parent company and operator of the U.S. cash market securities CCPs, National Securities Clearing Corporation (‚ÄúEn Es C C (prevent auto-ban) ‚Äù)."" Yes, the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) that runs Robinhood's clearing work. Second, he states that ""**The DTCC common shareholders include hundreds of banks, broker dealers, and other companies in the financial services industry that are participants of one or more of DTCC‚Äôs SIFMU subsidiaries, and the DTCC board is currently composed of 19 participant and non-participant directors.** Importantly, our ownership structure also ensures that we direct our primary focus toward addressing industry needs and preserving market stability, which is especially critical during times of crisis."" *See* [https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf).

**It just gets worse.** Back in the late 2000's, DTCC was sued for facilitating naked short selling. *See* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720). *Does this, uh, sound familiar?*

DTCC vigorously defended themselves during the lawsuit, arguing they had no role in the naked short selling issue. There appears to be an archived article stating DTCC's response to the accusation back in 2007:

""As DTCC has explained, short-selling and naked short selling are trading strategies.¬† These trading activities are regulated and policed by the marketplaces/exchanges, the self-regulatory organizations and the SEC.¬† **DTCC is involved in post-trade processing, which occurs after a trade is completed.¬† DTCC has no regulatory authority over trading activity or to release information related to trading activity.¬† In fact, as we told the WSJ reporters, we have no power to force the closing of an open fail, no matter what the cause, and we do not have the authority to force a buy-in**.""

They also stated that: ""**Freedom to trade is a cornerstone of our equity markets and a fundamental principle in the regulatory schemes that govern the markets**.¬† The SEC has flatly rejected the argument that there are such things as phantom shares or credits being created in the market."" *See* [*https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj\_response.php?lpos=3&amp;lid=3*](https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&amp;lid=3). Boy, would I love the freedom to buy a stock I want, even if Hedge Funds mess up and nakedly over-short a position during a squeeze!

The SEC also notes that the DTCC has a surprising amount of power to halt trading on a security for operational/transfer issues of a stock or fraud called ""chills"" or ""freezes."" *See* [https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib\_dtcfreezes.html](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_dtcfreezes.html). *But does this include jacking up capital requirements for overly-shorted stocks without any public notice and explanation behind the billion dollar deposit?*

**Let's also get this straight**: back in 2007 they claimed to have no authority in **pre-trading**. Only post. So what the hell happened this month with En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) and Robinhood then? Congress, are you listening? ¬†

**Why this matters**: Recently, Robinhood's CEO Vlad spoke with Elon Musk on Clubhouse, an app where Musk interviews guests. It gets interesting when Musk questions Vlad about the decisions of the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban), the DTCC subsidiary, to post $3 billion of capital at 3 a.m. in the morning during the meme stock trading frenzy. I'll put down the most relevant parts of the conversation here:

8:55 (Musk): Who controls those organizations, those clearing houses?

9:02 (Vlad): \[Awkward pause\] Um . . . you know . . . it's a consortium. It's not quite a government agency. You know . . . **I don't really know the details of all that.**

9:15 (Musk): OK . . .

9:16 (Vlad): But, you know, and to be fair, we were . . . we were . . . uh . . . I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets. Like these are events with these meme stocks and there was a lot of activity, so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it's not entirely unreasonable.""

**\*\*Now square this with Vlad's earlier comments during the interview:\*\***

4:02 (Vlad): The request was around $3 billion dollars. Um, which is, an order of magnitude of what it typically is. Right so, um.

4:17 (Musk): This seems like this sounds like an unprecedented increase in the demand for capital. **What formula did they use to calculate that?**

4:25 (Vlad): Well, um, yeah, just to give context Robinhood up until that point has raised, uh, you know a little bit around $2 billion in total venture capital up until now. So, it's a big number. Like $2 billion dollars is a large number right. **So, um, basically, the, and, you know, and I, the details are, we don't have the full details**, it's a little bit of an opaque formula but there's a component called the ""VAR"" of it, which is ""Value at Risk"" and, um, that's based on some fairly quantitative things although it's not fully transparent, but it's not kind of publicly shared. So, uh, there are ways to reverse engineer it but it's not kind of publicly shared. **And then there's a special component that's discretionary and that kind of acts like a multiplier.** And, um, basically . . .

5:24 (Musk): Discretionary, like meaning it is just their **opinion**.

5:29 (Vlad): **Yeah**, there, uh, it's a little bit, I mean I'm sure there's something definitely more than just their opinion.

The full interview is available on YouTube. Search: ""Elon Musk Grills Robinhood CEO Vlad Full Interview on Clubhouse."" Can't post the link.

**\*\*Breakdown:\*\***

Vlad is asked by this ""consortium"" to post $3 billion, 150% of Robinhood's entire venture capital amount, at three in the morning, or presumably, trading will not be cleared. However, Vlad doesn't ""really know the details"" of this ""consortium,"" but decides it's a good idea to deposit over a billion dollars in capital anyway. Moreover, this so called ""consortium"" apparently by contract can demand whatever they want to. I guess every reasonable CEO posts almost a billion dollars when asked by a group of people he doesn't really know too much about (around $700 million to be exact). *Yes, the figure was later negotiated down.*

Further, this ""discretionary"" posting requirement is completely absent in Robinhood's explanation to clients:

""**How do clearinghouses determine how much is required?**

It‚Äôs pretty technical, but the process basically works as follows: clearinghouses look at a firm‚Äôs customer holdings as a portfolio. They use a volatility multiplier, looking at specific stocks, to quantify their risk."" *See* [https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week).

I mean, man, is it really ""technical"" if the capital requirement can also be an ""opinion,"" that is, discretionary? That was conveniently *left out*. The fact is this: Vlad said one thing but *omitted* another. **Why.**

**TLDR/ The Rub:** What is Big Money? It's $63 fucking trillion dollars. The point here is not to peddle some unsupported conspiracy. The point is to expose an **apparent** ***conflict of interest*** and demand those in charge of our markets to reestablish public confidence. If you're going to take away the People's literal ""buy button,"" the People better have a right to know why. **Don't pull a fast one on the working people at 3 a.m. in the morning.**

Does no one remember what happened the week after RobinHood banned buying of GME? Seriously. There was this mass belief among those of us long on GME (and I should know, I believed in it) that SO LONG as the ticker closed above $320 on Friday, we would wake up Monday morning to the squeeze of all short squeezes.


And Monday morning in pre-market and all during the day we look at the stock, and lo and behold, the MOASS happened, and every single person who ever bought GME sold it for a price greater than $1000, and world peace was realized because the wealth had been redistributed through the markets for the first time in history.


No. It began the fall down to $40, which it finally hit towards the end of the month. Sure, it‚Äôs back above $100 per share, but that date was wrong and dangerous and a lot of people lost a lot of money.


Look, I‚Äôm long on GME. I believe there‚Äôs a possibility of a short squeeze. But the cultier the message becomes, the more ANGRY people are that other tickers are mentioned:


&gt;RKT is just a hedge fund attempt to distract people from GME, just like SLV was.


That‚Äôs a great point, buddy. Say, have you looked at their charts? Do you understand the fundamental difference between the mortgage industry and a ticker that purports to be backed by actual silver but isn‚Äôt?


Oh, and let‚Äôs talk about the gross overestimation of WSB‚Äôs power. It is literally impossible for this subreddit to P*mp and D*mp. Every good trade, every time a ticker pops off, it is because of institutional power and pressure and market conditions. When people make money off of these things, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre riding that train, not conducting it. No P*mp and D*mps are baked into the rules. Do you not trust u/zjz? What‚Äôs wrong with you. The market cap on tickers mentioned here has to be above a certain number to explicitly prevent p*mping and d*mping.
Don‚Äôt believe me?


Why isn‚Äôt PLTR at 50 then? No, seriously, why has it never hit $50 per share. They had a great earning last week. All over the subreddit people said it would hit $50.


In fact, if WSB is so damn important and powerful, how come GME spent almost an entire month below $60 per share in February?


Today could be a very good day. It could also be a very bad day- for whatever tickers you are invested in.


There are lots of great reasons to be long in GME outside of a potential short squeeze, and I personally think the stock is undervalued until it reaches a price of close to $200 per share, but I also think it will be incredibly volatile before that.


I also think it won‚Äôt earn that price target organically for two to three years. I think Ryan Cohen can successfully transform the company, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long on GME.


So, rather than convincing yourselves that you know everything, that it‚Äôs all going to work out in a specific way at a certain date because of THIS INFORMATION, why don‚Äôt you relish in the fact that you don‚Äôt know. Because I certainly don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know anything. I‚Äôm a fucking idiot who makes financial decisions based off of gut feelings and the things I‚Äôve read on a subreddit filled with other idiots.

Which_Stable4699,0.0,7314.0,"Tonight‚Äôs report has been built up to be a make or break point for GME. I want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data. Let‚Äôs start with what we know about tonight‚Äôs report:

1) This report is based on self reported data. 

2) The fine for misreporting, if caught, is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover.

3) The data report covers up until the 29th.

So what are the possible outcomes:

1) Data is accurate, HF covered: I believe at this point GME becomes a long play. There is the potential for an acquisition or a turn around/pivot in the business model. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

2) Data is accurate, HF did not cover: I believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can. This would push up the price pushing more expiring calls ITM and put further pressure on the HF. We would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on. The play is buy and hold.

3) Data is inaccurate: This is the most likely outcome given the money at stake. If it shows they haven‚Äôt covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data. If it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call. Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

In all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action. The only reason to sell IMHO is if you believe GME will go bankrupt. 

Ok so I‚Äôm going to buy if I can or continue to hold ... what could happen that would turn this around?

1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.

2) If not covered, GME reverse stock split. This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.

3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.

4) If covered or uncovered, significant renewed public interest in GME. A lot more likely if uncovered, but it‚Äôs a strange world we live in so I wouldn‚Äôt completely rule it out if they covered.

5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn‚Äôt already been done.

6) If covered, GME being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price. This would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the GameStop name lives on.

7) If covered, GME makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation.

Obviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape. Full disclosure, I am currently down around 100k in my positions on GME. In my mind, the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesn‚Äôt bother me to hold forever or until I win, whichever comes first. ü¶çüôåüíéüöÄüåï

I have been doing this for 1 month now and I'm 2k up, I really think this is the new way to build your portfolio with stocks.

It all started when I was thinking about my trading history, every fucking time I got wrecked. If I close a buy order, the stock usually goes down, the same way for a sell order, when I sell usually goes up. So I was thinking very hard on this, how could this binary outcome be so hard to achieve? Well, I invented a new way to build your portfolio so you will be 100% safe, I call it the B.R.T (Bait Retard Trades).

BRT - How does it work?

You will not do trading any different, you will continue to do your stupid trades, but this time you will use only up to 30% of your portfolio on your own trading ideas, and the other 70% you will use to perform the exact opposite. Warning! This will only work if you are honest with yourself, you should really think about what you think is best to use with your 30%, don't cheat and think the opposite just to use that on the 70%, you must trust the fact that you are actually retarded and don't know what you are doing, therefore the opposite position of your genuine choice will be the best. For example, last week I was thinking about getting some calls on PLTR that expires in a week, for many reasons I thought this was the best decision, so I did 30% of calls on PLTR and 70% on puts, made some money on the fact that I don't know what I'm doing.

Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!

**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.

New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings

Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&amp;P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)

**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn‚Äôt suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.

**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.

**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)

**START**

I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I‚Äôve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)

If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù as many have suggested.

**PROCESS**

I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Covariance &amp; Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)

[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)

The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on ‚Äúluck‚Äù or ‚Äúchance‚Äù. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to ‚Äúluck‚Äù. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.

**So, what does this mean?**

**My opinions.**

To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.

My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.

**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**

Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.

I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much

I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".

In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.

Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.

So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.

Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.

Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!

**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.

nrouns,0.0,7141.0,"I went into a GameStop with my girlfriend so she could buy her normal little Pokemon Knick knacks and t-shirts.... BUT.... My visit made me rethink that GameStop really is doing better than I thought.

First of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.

But seriously, I'm here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven't paid attention to their membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use their membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.

When it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What's the membership do.

It's 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.

I felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.

But the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.

Granted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but their membership program change is working.

I commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.

TLDR: felt like the new membership program was üî•, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.

But by staying in Robinhood, you scream ""Oh please daddy Vlad Tenev, please impale my asshole one more time like you did with Geee Emmm eeeEEEEE!!!"" 

# Why you should use a real broker and stop using Robinhood:

**Not being glued to a chart all day**

How many of you have your eyes glued to a fucking chart all day long because Robinhood is mobile and looks cool? This seriously is not helping any of your positions. You're more likely to dump what might be a solid play too early because you're staring at the ticker and have TP hands and panic when SPY is down 1% for the day. Think about all the times where if you held a position for a little while longer you would've printed. Robinhood looks amazing as an app and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. If the sell button is right in front of you at all times, you're gonna be more likely to dump when you shouldn't. Get a broker with a shitty looking UI so you aren't glued to a chart all day. Trust me, your relationships and work will thank you.

**Access to penny stocks**

Ever want to trade OTC penny stocks and make some real bank? It might be a good thing that some people don't have access to them given the inherent risk. But for some unknown reason, RH makes it easy to yolo your whole life savings into 0DTE so penny stocks are pretty safe compared to the options you can trade.

I wrote a DD on a penny stock on another subreddit and I got DMs about how to buy it on RH. Bruh please stop. Use a real broker.

**Actual customer support**

I haven't used Robinhood customer support for anything, but I've heard it's god awful. I'm gonna sound like a shill, but I've been using Schwab for the past six years and the customer support is amazing.

**Instant transfers**

Again, gonna sound like I work for Schwab or something (I wish). Schwab and many other big banks allow you to instant transfer from your checking/savings to your brokerage account with no limit. 

**Huge assets under management**

Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have 6.6, 3.3, and 3.23 trillion AUM. That's a lot of focken money. These brokers had no issues with the clearinghouses and did not limit trading on meme stocks. Gee Em Eeeeee would probably be 2000 if everyone used them.

**Cool desktop/web apps**

Wanna look like a cool badass trader to pickup bitches at your local library? Schwab has a FREE trading platform with many cool features like the dark pool block trades. Add fancy crayons and lines to your charts too! Not gonna lie this app probably makes it harder to stop looking at stonks all day thus defeating point number 1.

**Cons of not using Robinhood**:

I'm not blind to the pros of Robinhood.

\- Options are free (Schwab charges $0.65 per option contract)

\- Easy to use

Aric_Holbrook,0.0,6965.0,"**Ok look, idiots, I am no genius, but this drop from 170 to 100ish is not all bad.  TL/DR at the bottom for the most autist...**

Here is why- 

1) **We are still up huge from the close of yesterday** and have seen a solid ground at the 106 range. This establishes a floor, i.e. the minimum amount of money the stock can go if paper hands sell.

2) I have read multiple articles claiming **that Short Sellers just on Wednesday lost a total of 818 million.** Why is this important you may ask?? Well simply put for you fellow atuists, with these HF down nearly a billion in one day, they can't continue the squeeze because they have no capital to buy the calls back. **So this might leave us with no large increases until Monday until capital can be raised to cover.** 

3) We know from the past, that without capital **A) there can't be any short latter attacks B) the HF will be forced to pay high interest on these positions if they don't cover them. C) there will be a continuation of a squeeze if we hold.** 

IT won't LET ME POST THE LINK- just look it up it's the first article.

4) **Other shorted stocks have a good chance at rising too.** Rember GME is the big whale while other shorts like AMC, NOK, and BB are more like fishes (still valuable but not like the whale). So while HF gathers capital to cover shorts on GME, **they will have to pay BIG BIG BIG bucks on interest with the other smaller stocks.** 

**TL/DR: don't panic because you see a drop right now, there is a good chance that it is because of limited capital from HF because of Wednesday's crash, leading to no money to cover shorts.** This means HF will be forced to pay interest on the positions they still have and will lead to a bigger squeeze in the next few days.

DarkStar668,0.0,6905.0,"I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*

I‚Äôve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don‚Äôt line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.

Here we go.

October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.

*BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn‚Äôt* the squeeze.

*Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you‚Äôll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you‚Äôd still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.

Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn‚Äôt matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don‚Äôt risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.

Absolute worst case scenario is that you‚Äôre in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.

Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.

**TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn‚Äôt just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.

**Now on to the silver post**

This is a very long post, so I apologize to the WSB apes who can barely read and will have to scroll a long way to get to the TLDR. Its also been impossible to post about silver lately on WSB (no posts approved, thanks to the mod who assisted this one), so I crammed about 3-4 posts worth into this one.  Not sure when I'll be allowed to post again.

I've organized this post into 4 sections so feel free to skip around to the parts you are interested in.

1. The silver short squeeze evidence
2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS
3. The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed
4. TLDR, what to buy if you want to go long silver

Since my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/) on the potential for a silver short squeeze, I have been researching the topic to prepare a more detailed and substantiated update post.  This is my latest attempt to post, and hopefully this one gets to stay up (silver censorship has been a thing here lately)

**1.  The potential for a short squeeze (573% of the 'float' is currently sold short)**

The big thing to remember here is that if enough market participants who are long silver contracts in the futures market begin to demand delivery of their silver, there will absolutely be a meltup in the price  because there simply isn't enough supply available.

**The next 3 trading days are critical, and there is war being waged.  The shorts and COMEX are in a fight for their lives, and barely hanging on by a thread**

Many big name precious metals veterans have bemoaned for years about how the size of the 'paper' silver market absolutely dwarfs the amount of silver that could be delivered, and thus the market is manipulated.  The vast majority of futures and options contracts in the silver market have historically been settled via cash.  Meaning no physical silver is actually delivered when these contracts are set to expire. This is where the talk of the 100-1 and 250-1 paper silver to physical silver ratios comes from, but short interest is actually more like 6-1 on the COMEX using open interest data through the next two big delivery months.

Technically every month is eligible for deliveries, but only months with options interest tend to have any real volume, and that's why they are known as delivery months.  March and May are options expiration months, while April is not.

If you want to think about it like a stock, **the short interest is 573% of the 'float'**.  This is based on the fact that over the next 3 months there are futures contracts and options which have the right to take delivery of 847 million ounces of silver.  This is compared to only 147 million ounces registered on the COMEX that could fulfil these deliveries.  For perspective, GME short interest peaked at around 140% of its float, and that was considered crazy high.  It is widely known that if a small, but significant share of long silver contract holders took delivery, that there would not be enough silver, as the demand would cascade higher and higher as the prices rise.

(sources: [silver stocks report](https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls),  [futures open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/volume-open-interest/metals-volume.html), [options open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/open-interest-heatmap.html), data as of 2-18 was used in this post)

This would be similar to a bank run scenario.  The COMEX is the silver bank, and they have printed too many paper claims on a limited amount of silver.  If there is no actual silver left to be delivered to the holders of the futures contracts, that means that means that the COMEX would default and settle their contracts in cash.  No one wants to get settled in cash if the COMEX had to default.  This would mean that right as you want to be able to stay long silver, as the price is surging higher, that you will get forced out and paid cash instead of silver and wouldn't benefit from future increases in the price.  The traders who want to stay long silver and who see the run occurring would try to take delivery because if you actually have physical silver in your vault then it doesn't matter if the COMEX goes down, you still have your actual silver you can sell on the spot market.  Most importantly to them, they get to keep participating in the upside.

Now the shorts are very much trying to keep the price down at the moment, because their problems get worse as the price rises and more options become in the money.  See the chart below, with a handy arrow to illustrate where we are currently in terms of March open interest.

https://preview.redd.it/y6j90g954mi61.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2ad9f33ea4008e3380ce11eb4e9333669e1524e

As the price rises more and more, the short interest grows as more options on futures contracts become 'in the money', compounding problems for the shorts. This is the silver version of a gamma squeeze.

The chart below shows the number of ounces that would be eligible for delivery over the next 3 months, given the current open interest data.  Most of the open interest comes from futures contracts that aren't dependent on price, but I've made this chart to illustrate how the problems get worse for the shorts due to the options contracts as the price rises.  The latest silver price as I'm writing this is $27.37.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t91qm4t84mi61.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fee997ca32e24a60916e6829be375885263107c

But why would contract holders all of a sudden start to demand delivery when cash settlement has historically been the norm?  A couple of reasons.

The first reason is arbitrage.  Premiums on 1000oz bars have surged to somewhere between $1 and $2 an ounce (this is unheard of on the 1000oz commercial bars), meaning that traders can stand for delivery and then sell in the physical market for immediate profit.  When supply had become constrained in previous silver bull markets these premiums were more like 30 cents an ounce.

In addition, mints are also interested in arbitrage.  They could begin to take delivery to break down 1000oz commercial bars into smaller units which currently trade at historic premiums of $5-$8 an ounce.  The small unit silver market has experienced greater demand than ever before.  The entire stock of small unit silver was sold out at all dealers a few weeks ago.  The small amounts they do get in stock are only sold at massive premiums.

The second reason traders may take delivery is because they see the massive opportunity presenting itself right now, and they don't want to be cash settled when the COMEX defaults. They see that the squeeze is possible and that they profit massively by simply taking delivery, sitting on their silver while the squeeze happens, and then reselling it at much higher prices.  Early rumblings of massively increased delivery volume is already presenting itself in the data.  See the chart below showing the past 3 months of deliveries compared with the same time period in previous years

&amp;#x200B;

[\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise](https://preview.redd.it/5last6ye4mi61.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98c7a2371c60c258e363183e693b1540647ea00c)

Note that this chart corresponds with December of the previous year through February of the year that is labeled on the x-axis.  So 2016 actually represents December of 2015 through February of 2016.

It seems that the silver futures market is suddenly becoming a place where silver actually gets delivered in meaningful quantities.  This trend is even more pronounced when you look at just the most recent month of February, which like April was not an options expiration month, and thus typically has very low volume.  Even still, the increased interest in taking delivery of silver from the COMEX is very clear.   And historic at that.

&amp;#x200B;

[\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise](https://preview.redd.it/pk37q11tkmi61.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddd64a50dfc58bf0f5a118951096f7dda5f5c69)

February 2021 has had 9.95 million ounces delivered through 2-18, and there is still 1.83 million ounces in open interest.  Anyone still sitting in a contract this late in the month wants delivery, so we can safely assume Feb. deliveries will end above 11 million, and closer to 12 million.   This is compared with an average of only 2.20 million ounces delivered in the previous 3 Februaries. An increase of roughly 422% (assuming 11.5 million delivered).

March is gearing up to potentially be an earth shattering month for delivery requests that could send silver soaring.  March in the previous 3 years has averaged 26.79 million ounces delivered.  If this year's month of March experienced the same 422% increase in deliveries that occurred in February, that would represent \~140 million ounces delivered.  Enough to completely drain the COMEX registered stocks.  If typical contract roll-forward behavior persists, we are actually on track to hit around that number.  The chart below shows how March is on track to finish the month with between 30-40k contracts demanding delivery (each contract represents 5,000 oz).  Chart is courtesy of  [u/Ditch\_the\_DeepState](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ditch_the_DeepState/) who does an awesome job with these.

&amp;#x200B;

[note this has one more day of data relative to the chart above](https://preview.redd.it/ykkeebqflmi61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e85eed5a8056ce5025c92cf9fcaf6322ab72a36c)

**\*\*\***

The final day to roll contracts forward to not be eligible for March delivery is Wednesday, February 24th.  Given these are not normal times in terms of deliveries, it would not surprise me to see the decline for OI in March flatten out and stun the world by finishing with 40k contracts awaiting delivery.  The COMEX only has registered stocks to cover 29.4k.

And let's say the COMEX survives March and is able to meet all the delivery requests, this is what the May open interest looks like. Can you imagine the COMEX going into May with only 20 or 30 million registered ounces staring down the barrel of 450+ million ounces of open interest (and this figure will rise once March passes and/or the price rise causes more call options to be ITM).  At this point the long in May would absolutely stand for delivery and hope they are one of the lucky few who aren't force settled in Cash.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m5p95miq4mi61.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4163fc9c08e909d42207c5f2c4727c2ee0938f7

So even if only half or three-fourths of the 147 million available ounces are delivered, the May contract holders will see that the available supply is shrinking fast, creating even more demand for physical delivery because the opportunity is that much more clear for a continued short squeeze.  That and the fact that there are longs who really do want the silver for various reasons, and would be worried that the COMEX will default and there will be no silver available for delivery at all.

This is where critics of the potential for a short squeeze may point out that if the COMEX starts to run out of silver, they will just find more.  This is increasingly not an option however.  The primary stores of 1000oz bars are the LBMA vaults in London, and the COMEX.  When the COMEX starts experiencing high demand for gold or silver deliveries (typically due to the existence of premiums between paper and physical and a phenomenon known as backwardation), traders start chartering planes to deliver excess metal from the LBMA to the COMEX.  This occurred in March and April for gold and silver when physical started trading at premiums and traders began to demand delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2gvzf4m15mi61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71b04f46a16a1d389f8e9946d38d2230fe215519

The problem with this line of thought is that nearly all of the silver in the LBMA is effectively allocated already.  The most common silver ETFs such as SLV use the LBMA silver vaults to allocate silver to their ETFs, and recent historic inflows to these ETFs has created a situation where the LBMA simply does not have unallocated supply that they will be able to ship to the COMEX.  Bullionstar.com recently ran an article showing that 85% of the silver in the LBMA was now held by silver ETFs that utilize the LBMA stores. This means that this Silver cannot be taken from the LBMA to reinforce the registered stocks of the COMEX.

Also notice how last spring/summer is when LBMA inventory (shown in green) dropped, which aligns with when the silver price surged and increased COMEX deliveries were happening (2020 was a record year for deliveries).

&amp;#x200B;

The LMBA is estimated to contain 1.08 billion ounces of silver.  Meaning that 162 million ounces aren't already allocated to ETFs.  Not known though, is how much of this 162 million ounces is owned by wealthy individuals and family offices who already have a claim to it.  Indeed, the supply situation at the LBMA is dire enough that the worlds largest silver ETF, SLV, had to change it's prospectus to mention that they may not be able to find silver to allocate to their ETF in the near future.  They made this change on 2/3 following historic inflows, but didn't make the document public until 2/8 for some reason.  Nor did they announce the change.

Another decently sized silver ETF that I can't mention also changed their prospectus and directly mentioned that there might be a short squeeze and actually seems to sympathize with the hedge funds who would potentially be 'hurt' in the process

So why did JPM feel the need to [downgrade silver](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/miners-tumble-as-jpmorgan-downgrades-sector-and-silver-prices-slide-from-eight-year-high-11612259966) just as it started to spike, why did the CFTC feel the need to [raise margin requirements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/cme-raises-comex-silver-futures-margins-by-18-effective-feb-2) the very same day, and why did Goldman feel the [need to publish an article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/goldman-sachs-says-it-would-be-impossible-for-retail-traders-to-short-squeeze-silver.html) saying the squeeze was impossible, also on the same day?  They are terrified the squeeze of the naked shorts in the silver market might actually happen.  Just as the ETFs are now warning in their prospectuses.

The report from Goldman made the ludicrous claim that each member of WSB would need to purchase 4,200 ounces of silver to cause a squeeze.  Assuming approximately 8 million members at the time, that's roughly 33.6 billion ounces of silver, and at $27.37 an ounce, would represent $920 billion worth of silver.

There is a myth that the silver market is as large as $1.5 trillion in total, which is probably where Jeff Currie from Goldman somehow came up with this $920 billion figure.  This is a vast overstatement of the available investment grade silver.  These figures represent the grand total of all silver that has ever been mined in the history of the world. The overwhelming majority of this silver has been used in the production of various electronics, medical devices, and other products and simply cannot be recovered.  Maybe at $500 an ounce, dumps will begin to look for phones and other electronics and try to chemically separate the miniscule amounts of silver from each device, but at $27 an ounce this is completely unrealistic.  Even then, it would be a minimum 6 months to get silver recycled from these devices and into the 1000oz bar format that is required for the futures market.

If you look at various sources (google it), most of them estimate the entire quantity of investable silver in the world is somewhere between 2.8 and 4 billion ounces if you include the small denominations of silver (which can't be used to deliver on the COMEX).  Using the high end estimate at 4 billion ounces, this would mean the entire investment grade silver market is only valued at $109 billion. The futures market only deals with 1000oz bars of which there is estimated to only be 2 billion ounces worth.

**There are only 0.36 to 0.52 investment grade ounces of silver per person in the world if you include both the small denominations and the 1000oz bars together. At $27.37 an ounce this is only $9.85 to $14.23 worth of investment grade silver per person.**  Go take a stroll through some of the silver forums on reddit and you'll see people are buying 6 figures worth regularly right now.

The allocated *and* unallocated silver in the LBMA and COMEX in total is roughly 1.5 billion ounces, which is a far cry from the 33.6 billion that Goldman is referring to.  As I have mentioned, most of this 1.5 billion ounces is already allocated to owners as well.

Think about 2 billion ounces worth of silver in 1000oz format. That is a tiny, tiny number.  At current prices it represents $55 billion.  There are only 2 million 1000oz bars, and each one costs roughly $27,710.

**There is another asset that has been in the news recently that is over 55k in price (WSB bans mentioning it, I'm not trying to pump it, just use it for an example).  There are only \~21 million of these items that will ever be mined, and they are valued for their scarcity and deflationary tendency.  For every ten of these** ***things which shall not be named*** **there is only** ***one*** **1000oz commercial silver bar, and each bar costs roughly half of what 1 of the** ***things that shall not be named*** **costs.**

To say that silver could not have an epic surge in the same way, despite being 10x more scarce, and half the price at that, is ludicrous. Silver is used in production of actual real things and the supply over a long enough period will actually be entirely exhausted unless we figure out how to economically mine asteroids (which would only be economical at silver prices far beyond what's ever been achieved).

As part of my research for this post I was actually able to get in touch with silver industry veteran, David Morgan (thanks for answering a random guy's twitter DM David).  He told me an anecdote from back in the previous run-up during 2010-11 where he had a conversation with Eric Sprott who mentioned that Sprott Inc's purchase of just 22 million commercial ounces to start their ETF of PSLV was enough to drive up the price by over $2 an ounce.  Unlike the other silver ETFs which just allocate silver off of the LBMA, PSLV actually sources silver in the open market to add to their vaults, which is why investing in PSLV can actually cause the silver price to rise much more directly than the other ETFs.

So who is on the other side of this trade? Banks and large hedge funds, who are massively [net short silver](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f), to the tune of 91,468 contracts sold short compared with only 16,071 contracts long.  The banks are trying to make sure the price stays low so that they can discourage run ups in the price that would create a short squeeze (and cause them to experience massive losses on their naked short positions).

If you want more proof that these markets are historically manipulated look at the fines [JPM had to pay recently](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty/jpmorgan-to-pay-920-million-for-manipulating-precious-metals-treasury-market-idUSKBN26K325).  Which brings me to part 2.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS**

Several posts have documented the timeline of Silver posts on WSB and why the narrative of hedge funds pushing silver to hurt GME doesn't really make sense.

Here's a couple of them that I personally liked (and there are many more): [one from u/johnnycleveland](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemo97/how_reports_in_the_media_claiming_that_reddit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [another from u/blipblopbloop11](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/lhqk6p/100_proof_the_antisilver_movement_in_wsb_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Besides the fact that many on WSB were fans of silver long before the GME craze (including myself), banks have a massive net short position in silver (which I cover later in this post).  At the time the anti-silver post went viral about Citadel having a large position in SLV, it comprised only 0.04% of their AUM, and they actually had **3 times this amount, 0.13% of AUM, in** ***PUTS*** **ON SLV.**  [Proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/2Kw2Bac).  So it doesn't make sense for them to try and stop one short squeeze that hurts them by causing a second short squeeze that would also hurt them.

I'm not sure if hedge fund bots were actually driving the anti-silver propaganda, or if it just caught on because people wanted a scapegoat for the GME losses, but either way it seems like silver was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The people investing in silver, and the people investing in GME are natural allies.  Its a mix of a desire for tendies and giving big banks and hedge funds the finger.

Why weren't AMC, BB, NOK, weed stocks, and many other popular positions not considered distractions from GME?  Wouldn't GME have gone much higher if everyone on WSB had stuck to only GME and not these other plays?

**There was absolutely institutional collusion to prevent GME from getting the infinity squeeze it was set up to get.**  The interactive brokers CEO even said on live TV that ""the price was headed to infinity"" if they hadn't stepped in to ""stop the losses"".

This collusion is simply unrelated to the fact that some of us on WSB also like the silver market setup.  I totally agree that media reports of WSB 'moving to silver' were somewhat poorly worded.  Just as the reports of WSB moving to weed stocks were poorly worded.  Some people on WSB are playing silver, some are playing weed stocks, but these headlines make it sound like it's everyone when it's never true that all of WSB is long a single trade (GME may have been close though).  I understand frustration about poor reporting.  Please don't take it out on your fellow WSB apes though.

And if you are still holding GME and think it can squeeze again, I respect that and I still hope it goes to $1,000 and higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.  The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed**

First of all, as previously mentioned, the short side of the equation is almost entirely made up of banks and hedge funds, so keep that in mind when you might have sympathy for the shorts here.

Second, the demonetization of silver was used as a blunt instrument to impoverish the populace, and enrich the wealthy and bankers all the way back in 1873.  We know that wealth is generational, so if you had family living in the United States prior to 1873, and they were not wealthy, it is highly likely that they were massively impoverished by banker related corruption at the time.  Here's a quick rundown of what happened:

Originally both gold and silver were considered legal tender in the United States.

The monetary base was roughly half comprised of gold and half comprised of silver, with a fixed exchange rate of 15 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold.  Because silver was more common, it was considered the common currency of exchange with gold only being used by the wealthy in large transactions.

In 1873 a bill was signed to demonetize silver, while keeping gold as legal tender.

All of the common people had their savings in silver which became increasingly worth less relative to gold, while all of the wealthy had their savings in gold, so the value of their savings appreciated.

In line with the removal of 50% of the monetary base, we experienced roughly 50% deflation over the next few decades.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjruwxd65mi61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16da0a23620806a1d4722ff4eb9916837a67be60

Along with this deflation though, the value of debt also rose.  So if you were poor, and also likely indebted, with one stroke of a pen your money began to become worthless while at the same time your debt became progressively worth more due to deflation.  If you were a wealthy gold owner, or a bank, you likely owned that debt that became worth more alongside the gold you already held.  A double win for the wealthy, and a double hit for the poor.  One stroke of a pen created generational wealth for some, and generational poverty for others.

**Yet another reason squeezing silver, with banks on the other side of the trade would be true cosmic justice.**

Fundamentally, there are plenty of reasons why silver demand long term will rise.  On the industrial demand side, silver is used in solar panels, electric vehicles, other electronics of all kinds, and expensive space related items, where getting 100% electricity conduction is worth it compared with the second best metal of copper at 97%.  These industries are expected to grow quickly in the next decade and more silver will be needed for this reason.

Monetarily, the money supply is expanding at historic rates and most of the 'smartest people in the room' are calling for higher inflation in the next few years.  Pretty much every commodity except gold and silver have been on an absolute tear the last few months and they are breaking out into what most consider multi-year bull market cycles.  This will drive inflation even further.

Silver is more common than gold but spread rather thin in the earth's crust so it isn't mined directly in large quantities.  It's more typically a byproduct of mining for other raw materials. The lack of dedicated silver mines means that silver today is mined at only an 8-1 ratio to gold despite naturally occurring at roughly 18.75-1 ratio.  Silver is currently trading at a 66-1 ratio to gold, and gold hasn't even been rising lately.  In the 2010-2011 run we got down to a 30-1 ratio, and if people begin to worry about inflation and consider silver a monetary hedge, there's nothing stopping silver from getting to its natural ratio of 18.75-1 or even lower considering the industrial demand combined with the lower 8-1 production ratio.

These lower ratios combined with higher gold prices in the future mean that silver can realistically get above $50 in short order, possibly even above $100, and if you think the monetary system is really headed downhill, even up to the outrageous forecasts of $500+ from the likes of Patrick Karim on twitter.  Note that Patrick posts various charts all the time and his most recent forecast is $182 silver by 2023. Love your charts Patrick (give this man a follow).

In terms of timing this thing, look at the only other 3 times silver went into backwardation in the past decade (we've just entered the 4th time). Every single time it had a powerful rally afterwards, because it means that physical supply is constrained in the short run, and the shorts are trying to pay longs to get out of their contracts. And those other 3 times didn't have a true chance of COMEX default like this time does, supply/demand has never been this imbalanced and the premiums in the physical market are proof of that.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xmsp3tc63mi61.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa320bc6ee62d7067ab42a45a381f79139303906

**In the end, the goal of buying silver should be to make tendies and to end the manipulation of these markets. We need to get to the point where entering into a contract to sell silver means you actually have the physical silver to sell.  No more naked shorting and profiteering off the little people. An honest silver market is the ultimate goal here.**

&amp;#x200B;

**4. TLDR, what to buy**

To get the most secure, best value for your dollar in terms of silver I would personally prioritize purchases in the following order (others may prioritize differently and that's ok):

1. Take delivery on the futures market if you are able (no premiums, but only available to large players)
2. Purchase shares of the PSLV ETF who will then purchase 1000oz bars
3. Purchase 1000oz bars at retail if you can find them for reasonable premiums
4. Purchase smaller units of silver if the premiums come down to 15% or less.  There are roughly 1-2 billion ounces of small unit silver in the world that don't directly impact the 1000oz bar market, but demand for them does cause premiums to soar, which can then cause mints to purchase 1000oz bars to smelt into smaller pieces. This is also the preferred option for those who are concerned with the total collapse of the fiat monetary system and other doomsday scenarios.  Personally I'm just wanting honest markets and to make tendies which is why this ranks 4th on my list.
5. Purchase other silver ETFs such as SLV.  Purchasing these will at least theoretically take silver off of the LBMA, but recent disclosures from these ETFs are making them seem less trustworthy (note that there is no definitive proof of any kind of fraud from these ETFs)
6. Riskier Alternatives:  Purchasing shares of silver miners, calls on silver miners, and even calls on the other silver ETFs are all riskier bets and potentially more profitable short term.  This is likely what many here at WSB are going to do

Disclosure: I am long silver miners and silver ETFs at this time

Also disclosure: make your own choices, we are all individuals, this is my personal take on the silver market and it includes plenty of speculation and opinion.  Treat this post as just that, some random guy's opinion on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Update:** To the people saying this 'looks fishy' because of the comment to upvote ratio or award to upvote ratio, its only that way because of the people exactly like yourself who auto-downvote anything related to silver, and really anything not GME.  If this post had the same upvote ratio as my original post 3 weeks ago I'd legitimately have 5-10x the upvotes right now. And this post is far better and more deserving than my original one was.  Its a self-fulfilling prophecy over here where a noob sees a non-GME post, downvotes it without reading, OG WSBers see a well thought out DD and give upvotes and awards, then more cultists come along and say it looks fishy. Try reading the post first!

You know what is super fishy?  The fact that the WSB mod coup attempt occurred right when the anti-silver propaganda blew up and silver posts were banned after that as well.  Ask yourself who was in charge when silver censorship started and you'll realize what is actually fishy here.

Lots of words below, so here‚Äôs the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir‚Äôs products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it‚Äôs going where no clouds have gone before‚Ä¶ from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a‚Ä¶

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don‚Äôt have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir ‚Äì BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they‚Äôre in, I‚Äôm in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I‚Äôll self dox myself. I‚Äôm Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I‚Äôm a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I‚Äôm not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don‚Äôt kink shame. [Here‚Äôs a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser S√∂ze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I‚Äôm not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it‚Äôs built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce‚Äôs Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn‚Äôt ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google‚Äôs back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‚Äò*****Find the Terrorist*****‚Äô to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‚Äòcheat code for war,‚Äô and I think that is spot on. That‚Äôs why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I‚Äôll keep it short. It‚Äôs a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I‚Äôd give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I‚Äôve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I‚Äôm not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

&gt;*¬∑ I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
&gt;  
&gt;*¬∑ It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
&gt;  
&gt;*¬∑ I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*¬∑ I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here‚Äôs a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‚Äò*killed it*,‚Äô you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir‚Äôs products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‚Äòdecision‚Äô and ‚Äòdecision makers.‚Äô

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what‚Äôs more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft‚Äôs market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus‚Äôs dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn‚Äôt make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That‚Äôs absolutely bonkers and that‚Äôs why this is no surprise:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&amp;E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

&gt;*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal &amp; external) to ensure they‚Äôre airworthy when we need them. Since we don‚Äôt know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Our optimization models consider when ‚Äúbig events‚Äù (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives ‚Äì do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

**#4) Muthafuckin‚Äô Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can‚Äôt state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can‚Äôt scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir ‚Äì PG&amp;E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&amp;E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&amp;E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I‚Äôm not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don‚Äôt truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts‚Äì whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you‚Äôve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I‚Äôm largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it‚Äôs own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I‚Äôm not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I‚Äôm skeptical that I‚Äôll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That‚Äôs my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING

Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn‚Äôt matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. 

Longer version:

There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. 

GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It‚Äôs abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. 

GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it‚Äôs why we can do this. You don‚Äôt need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn‚Äôt new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won‚Äôt lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. 


Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don‚Äôt remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. 

I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs what hedge funds are doing. It‚Äôs all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. 

Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don‚Äôt look for a made up catalyst. It‚Äôs right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. 

I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God‚Äôs work (not religious just an expression). I‚Äôll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). 

This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that‚Äôs interpretation. 

I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!

I hope all newcomers see this...

**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)

EDIT: As someone rightfully pointed to RKT is not bad, just the bots and the public narrative is a bit suspect IMO

**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**...

1. **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote ""**Lackluster day**"" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!
2. **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **""GAMMA SQUEEZE"" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.**
3. The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high.

**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)**

4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.

**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a ""NEW SQUEEZE RKT"" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding.

I'm learning too. I was getting imposter syndrome from this post until I realized I'm only an imposter if I present myself as a professional. I'm no stock guru, I am just gorilla whom like the stock, and I felt compelled to post some important fundamentals I wasn't seeing in this subreddit. Respect to those on WSB who just want to do wild gambles, but this is relevant to GME/AMC. Anyway...

üíéüôåü¶çhere. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.

*DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn‚Äôt steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it‚Äôs worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are ""fundamentals"" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to ""outsmart"" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. Now personally, I like GME and AMC... I just like the way the letters look when I pull up my portfolio. This trading strategy is particularly relevant to those stocks, but is also relevant to the stock of any established, large company. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are countless other approaches to trading (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don‚Äôt think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***

**New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. (edit: sorry if at any point I‚Äôm making it sound like this is the definitive way to trade. My bad. Everyone‚Äôs strategy is different, but this works well if you‚Äôre patient, not emotional about it and would rather pay in ‚Äúopportunity cost‚Äù than losing money. If you‚Äôre worried about opportunity cost, invest less!) Since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.

**I would encourage people to buy the stocks they like, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don‚Äôt buy it at all.

Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone purchasing a heavily shorted stock bought in with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.

Now let's say you're buying a heavily shorted stock... if you sell at a loss, you are donating to the ""save the short sellers"" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you‚Äôre not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you‚Äôre thinking of investing so much that you‚Äôll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don‚Äôt. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.

Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.‚Äù Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss below cost basis, you're probably investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips. (edit: I'm sure there are experienced value investors to whom these types of orders are valuable, but for the average ape who cannot assess the value of a stock, they're generally just to hedge a gamble of more money than you probably should have invested to begin with. Personally, I like strategies that allow me to make money even if the stock goes down.)

Side note: personally, in the case of a stock with a potential short squeeze, I don‚Äôt have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on it when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch. (Some in the comments have brought up that you can use a trailing stop exit strategy. This is cool, and especially good if you can't watch it! But for example, if you place a 20% trailing stop, make sure you're 20% up when it gets placed!)

Although, if you want you can try to profit off volatility on the WSB favorites. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn‚Äôt really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when these opportunities will come around again. I'll note my positions, which are admittedly small, because I follow my own advice on not overinvesting. These are just the stocks I personally like: 101 GME averaging $106/share, 1000 AMC averaging $11.07/share.

Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you‚Äôre willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.

Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen in the case of GME, 2) for the price of the stock to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.

One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes ‚Äúunderwater,‚Äù you can always sell covered calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Make sure they are covered, i.e. you hold onto the actual stock for the duration of the call, otherwise it‚Äôs actually extremely risky. Although if you sold even a covered call on certain WSB favorites right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while. *""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" -Warren Buffet*

**EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just know that if you paper hand GME/AMC at a loss, you're screwing yourself and others who bought the stock. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of ""don't sell at a loss."" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.

**EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn‚Äôt (rare if you‚Äôre just a low IQ ape like me but recent WSB favorites are an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don‚Äôt have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù on sunk cost.

Started in November with $4,500 that I cash advanced from my credit card and saved by paying my rent with that card for 2 months. I initially bought 75% shares and 25% calls and just pressed buttons on my phone a few times here and then for the next couple months. I didn't want to post this until GME wounds started healing for others. I did, however, go down with the ship in my Fidelity where I lost about 25k on shares. Nothing I did was smart, I got lucky. DON'T FUCKING GAMBLE WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. THERE WAS 1 SPOT IN 10 MILLION WHERE THAT SHIT ACTUALLY WORKS AND I ALREADY TOOK IT. Please don't test your luck because you will lose your shirt and your wife will go stay with her boyfriend permanently. Otherwise, keep those Wendy's Tendies flowing you fucking retards.

Edit 1: Getting a lot of PM's asking for money. Bitch, I'd love to help everybody and will be making sizeable donation to charities and bringing video games to kids for Christmas. However, I don't just have cash everywhere. I actually adjusted my quality of life DOWNWARDS. Also, if you wanna PM me to ask where to learn about options, you better have some experience in business, logistics, trucking or brokering freight, so you can return the favor. I need help with something so tit for tat.

Edit 2: Got a lot of people messaging me asking about what shall not be named i.e. rule 4. If you are interested in that, you can go through my post history.

Edit 3: Can't I get a flair or something for being an absolute retard?

Edit 4: Yes people, this was my FIRST play in the stock market, I'm not a guru that could do this again. The first's one's always free or at least it was in my case! I am lucky, not skilled.

Edit 5: The week of the gamma squeeze, I was up to 90k. I pulled out 46k which was more than 10 times my initial investment. Had I not done that, I would not have had the balls to make this play. My best advice, **SET YOURSELF UP FOR AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN PLAY RISKY LIKE THIS AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU ARE STILL BETTER OFF THEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED!!!**

Edit 6: Volatility. How did I not wanna die with such large fluctuations? Well sometimes I did, that's what the liquor was for. Otherwise, as you can probably tell, I was born in the bytecorn space but way out of even the top 25 or 100 corns. I'm talking microcap that would put even the worst copperstonks to shame. This volatility pales in comparison and I became comfortable there, sometimes even happy.

**------**

**I) The Short Interest Numbers**

Short interest (""SI"") is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares. *See* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)*;* [*https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp)*.* Apparently other firms have used different versions of float. All other forms of float are likely incorrect, and not likely used by Finra. **This is an important assumption** \- if I am wrong here, then fuck.

**Edit** (to above): People are suggesting my float is wrong. That is exactly my point. I am using float as outstanding shares b/c we don't know what it is. If someone actually knows the float used by FINRA, post it; this post is then useless. The math working backwards from 226% is fair game, however. That's why it's possible I'm wrong (*see* [*https://www.highshortinterest.com/*](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)*)*. *See also* comment by [JeanGuyRubberboots](https://www.reddit.com/user/JeanGuyRubberboots/) below (ctrl+f). *Either way, it's remarkable that $GME on some sources is still the most shorted stock.* I want to see the actual float used by FINRA. Until then, here's the math based on the SI equation.

Total outstanding shares of GME is 69.75 million. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/).

Finra SI of GME is .78 as of January 27th. *See* [*http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0*](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0).

.78\*69.75 million = 54.405m. Thus, 54.045m million shares are short GME of January 27th.

To calculate real SI, we remove insider ownership. **Another big assumption**. Insider ownership stands at 19.06m. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/).

Thus, free float is outstanding shares *less* insider ownership shares. 50,750,000 shares.

**Real SI appears, at minimum, 1.07 (54.405m/50.750m).**

\----

**II) The Shorts Remaining and Covered**

On January 15th, GME SI stood at 121%. *See* [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31).

Thus, from January 15th to the 27th, we know at least 84.397m shares were shorted. (1.21\*outstanding shares).

By January 27th, 54.405m shorts remained (previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1.27). The number of shorts that covered from Jan. 15th to the 27th was was 29.992m. 29.992m/84.397m shares = \~35%. Thus, 65% of shorts pre-squeeze remain, owing APR.

Around \~35% of covering resulted in a 1,600% rise. Thus, a 65% cover rate (conservative) can yield a 2,971% rise. Let‚Äôs apply this math to now. From $50, this is a $1,485.50 GME price result. Could this happen? No idea. Notice the problem with this: I'm assuming *only* covering led to this rise. So this is simply a demonstrative point.

**New shorts from Jan. 27th to present likely opened at higher prices. 65% of those from $5, $10, $20, etc., probably remain. This is bad news for HF's.**

**III) The Effect**

Based on estimated remaining covers, price stagnation at $50 could result in further covering and collateral calls. This burden is reduced if HF's opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM. This part is unclear. We know it's very likely that HF's opened new shorts at the peak--- what isn't clear is that it was within their risk department's policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze. In my opinion, it wasn't until drops below &lt;$200 the HF's felt safe opening up new shorts. This is a substantial point: if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought, then the pain points for HF's are far lower. It's just unclear. Nonetheless, HF's may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts.

A good counter is that borrow rates currently seem low for new positions. *See* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). You'd think these are correlated markets, so the most shorted stock on the market would have higher borrow rates. Borrow rates could be low because it's no longer shorted. Or because there is no volume on the stock. I'm not sure what borrow rates are for open short positions, but I imagine they're higher. I don't know more beyond this. Feel free to debate.

Moreover, consider the current liquidity and volume of $GME. It appears that retail buying power is spent. People either cashed out or are holding. So, they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze - or a gamma one for that matter. Thus, the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional. Not all hedge funds are short $GME - nor are all financial whales. In my view, this has become an institutional fight, with both sides pointing the gun at each other, waiting who's going to pull the trigger first. Retail is simply on the sidelines, holding the clips in for both their guns (smirking, of course). How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure? Or I guess one Moby Dick will do it. My reservations in these predictions is that HF's are smart, they can't be fooled twice, etc., and all of that non-sense. But before intelligence comes greed. And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system.

**IV) Parting Thoughts**

It would take a half-brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers. Yet Finra was late (posted after hours I think). This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers - yet, again, **dead silence** from the mainstream media. Sources are using various versions of float to calculate SI, as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests. Americans with $2,000\* in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud (that is, the general public and the focus doesn‚Äôt appear to be on hedge funds) and not the Big Money that loop-hole-engineered an illegal 140% naked short situation. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/); *see also* [http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/](http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/).

The Big Short is illustrative. It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions. Put differently, fraud doesn't just pervade the system - nay, it ***is*** the system. Everything I've seen *just doesn't feel right*. Understand at this point I'm speculating. But I trust my gut.

There are also posts suggesting OTM/ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of $GME. This is beyond my knowledge span. However, if you looked at the bid-ask spreads this week of $GME, they were at times pennies apart for days. I've never seen that before. Seriously, **what the fuck.**

DFV is testifying alongside the CEO's of Robinhood, Citadel, and Melvin Capital. Next Thursday is a day to watch for me. Again $GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America - and, arguably, the globe. Americans *and the world* will be reminded why their holdings in $GME tanked 50-90%. For many, their life savings. No, it wasn't a result of imprudent investments -- to invest money into a squeezing stock is a *good* idea short-term. It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because *the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money. So when the risk of you getting that rich increased, they stopped the game (pun intended)*. We don't even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion - that's just speculation, and it doesn't even matter to establish how messed up this is. But think of how this plays out: these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it. Or they tell you the truth that, based on risk management and capital models, they never thought retail would get that rich that fast. Either way, I don't think it'll play out well for them other than DFV on national television. A key element to the public's reaction: AOC grilling the hell out of these folks. That will likely infuriate a lot of Americans watching.

And to set the record straight, I don't think retail is propping $GME at $50 because they have diamond hands -- middle America is holding because *they have nothing to lose* after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half. **So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired.** In the process of stunting buying pressure, they inadvertently made chunks of working America diamond holders. Poetic justice - and fucking hilarious.

I'm not demonizing rich people. We all want financial freedom. I'm demonizing cheating the game. However this ends one thing is clear: The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie.

**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lspbb5/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and/)

---

**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.

---
**Analysis**

Currently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. 

* At each $10 threshold up to $150/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. 
* At $160/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.

&amp;nbsp;

Since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).

&amp;nbsp;

**If price were to squeeze up to $810/share (~56b market cap): 

* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float
* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze
* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)
* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions

Apes, and Redditbros,

I'm sorry that I've to make new posts to prove my point, unfortunately, every time I raise a warning regarding Chamath or GME, I got downvote a ton that I can no longer make any comments with a NEGATIVE comment Karma. If there are still good people left on Reddit, please advise me how to get out of the negative comment status. I won't be able to reply in a comment when those mods and bots attack me again and tag this as fake news.

This is not spreading misinformation. Chamath did sell out his entire position at SPCE!

Here are the links to prove it

Here is what he said last month when he sold another round before selling all of them

‚ÄúIf I could really just go for it, I wouldn‚Äôt sell a share of anything I buy because I believe in it,‚Äù he said on Feb. 8 in an interview on Bloomberg Television‚Äôs ‚ÄúFront Row.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut every now and then, I run into liquidity constraints, like everybody else.‚Äù

He SAID he BELIEVE IN IT! he is a clown and hypocrite. Use your judgment. It's hard to believe what I'm saying here is fake news and an act to spread misinformation

mamagaye,0.0,5329.0,"I wanted to share my YOLO story with everyone! (images below text):

I like to think I am one of the biggest ROKU bulls around. Despite following ROKU since the IPO, I had missed most of the gains in 2019. When COVID crash came I said to myself if there was an opportunity to get ROKU again I would scoop it up with every freaking penny I could.

I YOLO with just over 500k in options in April 2020. My strategy was to buy 6 month call option contracts so I could weather any storms, and I did right out of the gate between April to June.

Sold my OCT 17 2020 calls which I bought in April on Oct 17 for 2.3 million. I YOLO that 2.3 million into more 6 month calls expiring in APRIL 2021.

Current market value over $18,000,000 (CAD)

Kicker is - I think ROKU is going to double again this year all day long... I am all in on this play until ROKU is done printing money... Going to 30 million, 50 million then 100 million even if it takes a few years.

Go ROKU!!!

My second batch of ROKU trades acquired on Oct 17, 2020 below.

traderbabe22,0.0,7360.0," TL/DR: Forbes can suck it. This is my rant. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

   
 

I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday. The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.

   
 

The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.


SOUNDS GOOD,  RIGHT?



Well, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US (retail investors) as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.

   
 

Its disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.

   
 

When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.

   
 

NOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.

   
 

But when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.

   
 

I don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.

   
 

But dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.

   
 

I'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.

I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips. I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.

   
 

My credit is not great, so I cant finance a car. (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the ""Your job is your credit"" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.

   
 

I want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.

   
 

I want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.

   
 

I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

   
 

If this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch.

   
 

But it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a ""premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty."" as FORBES claims. ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!

   
 

Are you friggin' KIDDING ME??? My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market. The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.

   
 

WE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life! And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.

   
 

We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?

   
 

Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?

Truth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed.

   
 

And I'm sorry if they are freaking out. But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.

   
 

TO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities.

   
 

I just want to ride the rapids. To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming. Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie. That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.

   
 

I will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view. I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.

   
 

And hey Forbes, hey Cramer. Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.

   
 

THATS not greedy. Its INEVITABLE.

   
 

(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO. I LIKE THE STOCK)

   
 

   
 

   


EDIT:

Seriously tho. We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles. No matter our color, gender, race, religion or political ideology, the real war is against evil and corruption. For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness.

ramjaz,0.0,5083.0,"It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

* Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon‚Äôs cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.
* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX¬Æ Neutrino¬Æ Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company‚Äôs [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‚ÄòApollo‚Äô autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry‚Äôs QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they‚Äôre not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here‚Äôs what the skeptics don‚Äôt realize though. They don‚Äôt realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it‚Äôs a phone company. Well, it‚Äôs not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry‚Äôs **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it‚Äôll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it‚Äôs not a meme stock.**

EDIT: Well, WSB mods have banned me for linking my video. Oh well.

EDIT 2: By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue, mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy.

Also, I forgot to mention this: to all the retards out there saying ‚ÄúBB is not PLTR‚Äù lemme let you in on something.

**BlackBerry‚Äôs Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.1B**
**Palantir‚Äôs Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.05B (ESTIMATE)**

And again...

**BlackBerry‚Äôs Market Cap: $7.3B**

**Palantir Market Cap: $55.6B**

EDIT 2: Updated graphs and tables to calculate the Short Volume as a percent of total daily volume which was very interesting! The last 4 days we have seen Short volume as a percent of total volume between 58-62%. During the last jump in price, we saw between 32-54%, so as a percent of daily volume, the shorts are even HIGHER than last time!

EDIT: Thank you u/RicFlairsCape \- correct about the volume being total volume, not total shorts. i have updated the formula, looking at total short volume executed. Agree we don't know if it is all new positions or not, but the volume increase of acted shorts is in line with what we saw last time.

Shortly after, there were many warning posts of the remaining dirty tactics that we would face in the coming weeks, the serious manipulation, and the fact that it would realistically work on a lot of people. Mark Cuban stopped by, gave us some sweet tips, and warned us that very likely they think they're smarter than us &amp; kept shorting. We are now in those coming weeks, and we are being mercilessly invaded with BS. This clearly indicates that there is an active effort to manipulate our users, which is a sign to me that we are on the path to doing some damage, and who else would target this community in this way? They have picked their side of this tug of war. Now, what side have others picked? Ask yourself this - if you were ANOTHER hedge fund right now, or any wealthy individual who dabbles in investing, would you jump on the short train and try to bankrupt Gamestop, kick back and watch, or buy GME? You are all out here looking like fools if you think the rich people that AREN'T shorting GME aren't trying to jump on this fucking money rocket. These people are rich for a reason, they are playing fucking 4D chess on y'all stupid fucks while you pick your nose and can't remember why you bought the stock you literally bought two fucking weeks ago. You have doubts now because your 30 year old neighbor who invests in bonds made a comment about how loaded you'd be if you sold at $400. Stay strong in your resolve, take note of the clues around you, and remember what convinced you this was a good decision in the first place. Unless you're a mouth breathing humanoid who just wanted to 10x their pathetic life savings instantly and bought in without reading more than three sentences, in which case, you're probably in the right place so just shut the fuck up for a while until this blows over. 

This is not financial advice I kinda just like the stock.  

üöÄüöÄüöÄ

tl;dr - there are a lot of other people/hedge funds that invest money that aren't active on WSB or currently shorting GME, and they've probably put some thought into how they can most profit off of this situation based on actual analysis. I'm not one of those smart guys but it seems like usually the answer where more rich people get richer is how it goes.

EDIT: I've been looking at users tonight and noticed there are seemingly bots that got in early enough to pretend to be in on the hold, all just to make it even more convincing when they decide to sell. There are also bots offering to pay redditors to post about selling GME, and maybe redditors are taking the bribe even if they aren't selling in true WSB degenerate fashion.

Why did we not get transparency about how g√¶mstonk megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?

First, the thread wasn't made.

Then the threads made by users were being manually deleted.

Then we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of ""no more g√¶mstonk daily threads, more news later.""

That comment got deleted.

Then we're told ""it's because interest in g√¶mstonk has died down"" (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)

Then RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off g√¶mstonk pushers.

Then we get told that the mods simply ""forgot"" to make the g√¶mstonk thread.

Then finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.

...

What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?

You don't want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.

I haven't seen ANY good DD on g√¶mstonk for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday? Somehow *that alone justifies a sticky?*

That precedent is extremely dangerous. I hope you have highly competent tools that protect against vote manipulation and spam... because if all it takes is a single highly rated post and ticker the day before to earn a sticky the following day... you leave the entire subreddit vulnerable.

As a side note... Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN g√¶mstonk IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.

I am extremely bullish on GME and in my opinion this is the second best time to buy. It can't only go up. But if momentum is there... it can. I doubt MM's have delta'd for 200. 250. 300. 350... for this Friday, because right now it's limping at 115. And there are 24,000 calls at 800 for Friday. That is just ASTRONOMICAL.

Movement is best THIS WEEK.

Nobody knows it... because all the front page g√¶mstonk text posts are just straight dumpster garbage. Zero information. All fluff. And people wonder why they think it's a dead play, a dumb play. 

I don't want to believe asinine theories like top-down manipulation. So some clarity on this is going to deeply alleviate that poisonous sentiment.

I am hoping that I won't be downvoted to oblivion because I'm actually trying to help people understand as much as I can and be more successful. I'm not an expert so this is my best understanding of how options work.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's talk about options...

## Strike Price

A strike price is the set price at which a derivative contract can be bought or sold when it is [exercised](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp).¬†For [call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), the strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder; for [put options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp), the strike price is the price at which the security can be sold.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)

the strike price is what everyone screams about and it's the magic numbers we want to watch the price go to in order to ensure our options are In The Money (ITM) If options are ITM that means that your option has value, even if it doesn't go past the point where you hit a break even ( which ideally you want to see to realize a profit) All option contracts that are ITM are subject to potential exercise and this is where the magic happens.

Options that expire OTM are worthless. All those 3/5 C800, yes all 30,000 of them that expired? Free money to the people that sold them to you? Why did you give free money to the people that are going to spend it to try to stop you from making more money? Well probably because you didn't understand what you were doing.

&amp;#x200B;

# Premium

This is the money you paid to the option seller. The hedge fund, the market maker, the theta Chad trying to fuck your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend. You need to keep in mind that this money goes directly into their pocket and they don't just put it away for a rainy day. They may do shit with that money to increase their chances of being correct and your chance of being out of the money (OTM)

&amp;#x200B;

## Delta

Delta is the ratio that compares the change in the price of an asset, usually [marketable securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketable_security.asp), to the corresponding change in the price of its [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp). For example, if a stock option has a delta value of 0.65, this means that if the underlying stock increases in price by $1 per share, the option on it will rise by $0.65 per share, all else being equal.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp)

At-The-Money options typically have Deltas hanging around .5 ($.50 per $1 of underlying price movement) where as far OTM calls have extremely low Delta because they're still extremely unlikely to expire ITM. Options that are ITM already have Delta's around 1($1 for every $1 of underlying price movement) because every gain is seen as a profit because you're already past the point of probability.

&amp;#x200B;

## Gamma

Gamma is the rate of change in an option's [delta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) per 1-point move in the underlying asset's price. Gamma is an important measure of the convexity of a [derivative's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) value, in relation to the underlying. A [delta hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp) strategy seeks to reduce gamma in order to maintain a hedge over a wider price range. A consequence of reducing gamma, however, is that [alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) will also be reduced.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

Gamma incorporates time. Gamma will be low and look much like a bell curve with respect to time. When time decreases the price of the option is extremely sensitive to time because you have less time to see your option change in value. ITM options become increasingly more likely to expire ITM and OTM options become increasingly less valuable because it would take a fucking miracle to make them ITM.

&amp;#x200B;

# Let's talk about orders and price movement a little

What makes selling an option safe? What makes it risky? Ask yourself a simple question. if you want to be successful are you move likely to sell an OTM call at C50 or C500. Obviously you're more likely to not get assigned your call exercise if your strike price is higher. How can you understand the risk?

A few key concepts

&amp;#x200B;

# Volume

Knowing how much buying and selling happens on a regular basis can inform your intuition as to how much volatility you might expect. If you see a stock with a volume of 1M you might assume from that the chance of volume of 100M is very low.

&amp;#x200B;

# Holding

Holding your shares of your stock does a few things when we consider basic economics

* It lowers the supply of the desired underlying.
* It may not have any effect at all on the demand
* Smart people will look at a 'cult' of people holding and understand that this is a 'control' or a constant rather than a variable on which they can incorporate to make decisions. If you know people won't sell suddenly and that if you can presume that they have no more buying your a portion of your risk is mitigated by the simple fact that you are concluding a buying frenzy is unlikely to occur =&gt; making sold calls safer.

Consider the bloodbath of the past few weeks. Stocks are tumbling but GME... it's basically stayed very consistent. Some stocks are down 20/30 percent, but GME is basically flat. How? people aren't selling and they also aren't buying that much.

&amp;#x200B;

# Open Interest

Open interest¬†is sometimes confused with trading [volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp), but the two terms refer to¬†[different measures](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050615/what-difference-between-open-interest-and-volume.asp). On a day when one trader who already holds 10 option contracts sells those 10 contracts to a new trader entering the market, the transfer of contracts does not create any change in the open interest figure for that particular option.

No new option contracts have been added to the market because one trader is transferring¬†their position to another. However, the sale of the 10 option contracts by an existing option holder to an option buyer does increase the trading volume figure for the day by 10 contracts.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp)

# What strikes are people buying calls for? (expiry 3/5)

&amp;#x200B;

|Strike|Open Interest|In the money?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|30|63|Yes|
|40|598|Yes|
|45|4612|Yes|
|50|1597|Yes|
|135|\~5500|Yes|
|140|\&gt;14,000|No|
|250|4854|No|
|300|5446|No|
|800|\~30,000|No|

All the ITM calls retained value and can be sold or exercised. all OTM calls are worth NOTHING.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any surprise that it ended up this way? Ending the week above $140 would have caused option sellers to either buy back or get assigned for 14,000 \*100 =1,400,000 shares

&amp;#x200B;

# If you were an option seller, and you were smart enough to buy GME at $50 and you sold covered calls or naked calls at $140 and you saw it at $140 what would you do?

* Sell your shares to lower the price
* Consider shorting it to lower the price
* Buy the underlying to hedge against the oncoming ass fucking (this is a gamma sqz)
* Literally anything but give retards on wsb 1.4Million GME shares worth of money.

# Here's a list of the things you would NOT do

* Stop selling super deep OTM (C800) calls
* Stand by and watch and risk losing your 5th yacht while working class assholes take your money

&amp;#x200B;

Jail is for poor people, never forget that. It's not for rich people.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at what some folks are buying these days

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0kcgnkle5cl61.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=346f279562a639f270f3aace65f050af4066a58d

[Do you guys see what the problem is yet?](https://preview.redd.it/jzu7qymu3cl61.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1407dcfa5492f20d740b073dad7c9c91f0f702e6)

People are spending their money buying these retarded calls that have no chance of success.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember when I said earlier that if you sell a call and you have money it's in your best interest to use that money to increase your chance of success?

It makes sense to spend as much much as you need to to mitigate risks. If you winning cost them $100,000,000 and it will only cost them $99,999,999.99 to make sure you don't expire ITM, guess what...

THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT THING.

This is the basic economics of opportunity cost. For you retards that didn't take economics or don't read it means the valuable path is derived by comparing it to all other paths.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously they're not spending all of their premium to make sure options expire ITM, if they were it'd be a bad trade to begin with. These folks are smart, they know math, understand probability and have a deep understand of options arbitrage, orders, limits etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what am I saying?

# TLDR

Buying super far OTM calls is fucking retarded. You're just handing the people you're trying to beat free money. It's harder to win when you keep giving all the advantages to the people you're trying to take money from Yes of course they could become the biggest gainers but they are the last calls that will become profitable. So say we had a gamma sqz to 790 and you hold until near expiration. Guess what? Theta(option price decay over time) murdered all your money because you wanted to spend all your cash on the absolutely least likely successful call.

Buying ATM/ or close OTM (Next Strike) has a very real possibility of actually making you money. Those options might actually cause a price increase.

If people who bought calls were stacked ATM near the current market price this could very easily start a gamma squeeze. Every seller doesn't want to get fucked so every single one of them is going to try to cover their own ass.

Like if the options were something like

* 135 - 15,000
* 140 - 12,000
* 145 - 20,000
* 150 - 15,000

# SUDDENLY

All of the call sellers become potential panic-buyers afraid of losing their Manhattan condo.

Do you see the difference? Every time a strike is hit the next strike becomes almost destined to be hit. The amount of shares needed to cover those sold calls forces the price up if they're exercised and it's a mathimagical chain reaction. The important thing to look at is what is the volume of limit sells between the strike prices? if there isn't enough shares between strike prices that are within that price range it $135 going ITM makes not only $140 to go ITM but now suddenly $145 may become ITM and we haven't even dealt with $140 yet. Do you get it now?

Don't come at with that bullshit like I'm a shill or bot either check my history I was posting DD pre-GME craze.

If you think I'm wrong =&gt; cool. But don't downvote me because I'm trying to help you. I wish all of you the best and I hope GME goes to $1,000 and Biden legally classifies DFV as the first living deity in human history.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Yes I'm fully aware that you can buy far OTM calls and sell them later before expiration and realize gains if the  price goes up. Day trading option traders are not the target audience of this piece so fuck off kindly.

If you liked my post you can check profile for other shit I've written and also proof I was in on GME

The key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.

VWAPs can be treated as the ""true"" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a ""bounce"" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.

There is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.

Longs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.

In a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.

So I‚Äôve made a list of questions we‚Äôd like to see asked and answered.
No more bullshit!


1. Vlad, Confirm date, time and timezone you referred to when you said that 5am was when you were given notice to new margin requirements on the 28th of January.

2. DTCC confirmed they waived their margin requirements 30minutes before market open on the 28th of January. You stated those margin requirements were the reason for limiting purchasing of AMC and GME. If those requirements were waived, why did you limit the sale, and why did you lie during our last meeting?
 why were those trading restrictions continued after Robinhood was aware of the margin requirements being lifted?

3. Citadel, you‚Äôve had adequate time sense out last questioning to verify if someone at Citadel was in direct contact with Robinhood regarding GME and AMC directly. Was any current or prior employee, contractor or fulltime, in contact with Robinhood directly regarding these tickers?

4. Citadel, you injected several Billion dollars into Melvin Capital and also have financial ties to Robinhood. Do you believe that is a conflict of interest

5. Vlad, who made the offer to restrict buying on AMC and GME? Why were those stocks specifically picked when you chose to restrict

6. Vlad, Why did you restrict buying of shares and options when you could have made restrictions on options alone to satisfy what you claim were increased margin requirements. When someone has cash to purchase shares that are not on margin why restrict them?

7. Vlad, free and efficient markets would dictate that if there were ever a moment in which stock needed to be paused, it would have been paused for both buying and selling and that options contracts would be adjusted for time. Why was this not your approach?

8. Why didnt the SEC step in and halt trading

9. Why does IBKR say they were worried about locating shares? Why were shorts not forced to close their positions?

10. Vlad, did Robinhood reachout to the SEC for recommendations regarding how to handle the AMC and GME stock before cutting off retail investors and not Hedgefunds?

11. Melvin, do you know what a short ladder is?

12. Melvin, were you aware there was a handful of traders after the stock was restricted that were using a shortladder technique to further drive down share value of AMC and GME? Their trading charts were almost identical which is a statistical impossibility unless automated systems were artificially brining down those shares.

13. Melvin, did you increase your short interest in GME during the January 28th retail stock restrictions?

14. Melvin, do you or anyone at your company have any have knowledge of contact with media, including social media, to spread false information regarding GME or AMC?

15. Citadel, do you or anyone at your company have any knowledge of contact with media outlets, including social media, to spread false information regarding GME or AMC?

16. Vlad, were you or anyone at Robinhood in contact with Interactive Brokers about GME or AMC, anytime in the leading up to the January 28th stock restrictions?

17. Vlad, the ceo of Interactive Brokers admitted on live TV(Feb 17th) that if buying restrictions were not set on retail investors then share price of GME would have forced shares to go into the 1000‚Äôs. Causing shortsellers like Melvin to default on their brokers leaving brokers covering themselves. Was this the real reason you cut off retail investors?

18. Citadel, the number of shares that failed to deliver on GME is massive. Were the ‚Äúfailures to deliver‚Äù an artificial tool used to drive down share price? Do you have knowledge of someone who did?

19. Melvin, did you take advantage of stock ‚Äúfailure to deliver‚Äù to bring down share price of GME and AMC? Do you have knowledge of someone who did?

20. Melvin, last time you admitted to a gamma squeeze of shares on GME. Is it still possible if another buying frenzy happened that an actual short squeeze would take place?

21. DFV, do you think that if another buying frenzy happens on GME and AMC that another potentially huge short squeeze will happen?

22. Melvin, what is your current short interest in AMC and GME?

23. Citadel, if another buying frenzy happens on stock like AMC and GME, what kind of a loss could citadel directly see?

24. DFV, are you confident enough in GME to allow your options to execute and buy more shares at a deep discount?

25. DFV, what could executives at GME do to protect their shareholders at this point?",wallstreetbets,25 questions I‚Äôd like to see answered during the next House meeting about GME,4499.0,0.97

My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they‚Äôve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation. 

As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they‚Äôre trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they‚Äôre selling off their valuable possessions. So they can‚Äôt borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they‚Äôre selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don‚Äôt give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost. 

The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves. 

Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they‚Äôll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that‚Äôs my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov‚Äôt. Not only that but now they‚Äôre on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I‚Äôm sorry.

TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities. 

My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I‚Äôd be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it.

fortifier22,0.0,4433.0,"Alright fellow apes, in light of everything going on with our glorious meme stonks, we need to take some time to reflect upon our financial literacy and health. This is so that when we‚Äôre able to squeeze the big boys out of their billions, our gains will actually matter.

[It is a fact that the vast majority of lottery winners lose all their winnings, even go bankrupt, within a few years of receiving their winnings.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-lottery/2019/12/27/742b9662-2664-11ea-ad73-2fd294520e97_story.html)

In other words, if we don‚Äôt use our gains wisely, they‚Äôre just going to go back to the big guys that are screwing us over.

So here‚Äôs some simple yet solid financial advice from rich people that can help you keep and grow whatever gains you‚Äôll be getting within these next few months;

# 1.) Have a strict budget.

One of the most common budgets for wealthy people is this ;

**50%** of their money goes towards **necessities** (rent/board/mortgage, groceries, utilities, insurance, transportation, etc.)

**20-30%** goes into **investments**

**10-20%** goes into an **emergency fund** they can access quickly

**10%** goes towards **wants** (entertainment, restaurants, treats, etc.)

Again, not everyone can follow this budget to a T, and some don‚Äôt have to. But it will be important to budget your income and gains into these four separate categories in whichever way works best for you so that you can have strong financial health.

# 2.) Prepare for taxes

If your gains are big enough, and unless you‚Äôre going to keep them all in a tax-free account, you‚Äôre going to have to study up on what tax rates will apply to you and your gains.

For example, if you get $1.5M, and the tax rate for those sort of gains is 33%, only use the $1M and save aside the other $0.5M solely for taxes.

# 3.) If your gains are big enough, hire a financial advisor from a trusted institute

Anyone who makes huge amounts of money will be wise to hire someone that can help them understand what to do with it.

So if your gains are too overwhelming for you, and your first instincts are to instantly buy all the things you‚Äôve ever wanted, you will actually be wise to calm yourself down and do your research on who you can trust with your money.

DO NOT follow the financial advice of anyone that comes to you. YOU must go to THEM.

This leads me to my next point;

# 4.) Expect scammers, beggars, and family to come out of the woodwork if you make your gains public

There are people who dedicate their lives to manipulating others to get what they want. And if you make your wealth public by either telling everyone about your gains, or flashing your wealth around, you will become a prime target to some of the scummiest, two-faced con artists on Earth.

Even family and friends can suddenly show up and subtly ask you for money. They may not be doing this on purpose or out of sheer selfish desire; it‚Äôs just human nature.

This also leads me into my final point;

# 5.) Prepare for your entire life to change.

Your personal, relationship, and work life will all change whether you like it or not with your new big gains.

Prepare for the transition to be stressful, to challenge everything you know and are, and for you to need to re-evaluate your relationships with others as well as your purpose in life.

Again, the vast majority of people live most of their lives working hard just to get by. Now that money is less of an issue, that changes everything.

# 6.) Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre still human

You are not a genius or a God now that you have this wealth. You can still bleed, and you will die just like everyone else will.

This also means that your greatest satisfaction and joys in life will not come from your wealth or the things you can now buy that most can only dream about buying.

It comes from the little things.

It comes from giving.

It comes from living in and for love.

And if you forget about it, you‚Äôll only become the very kind of people that we‚Äôre fighting against.",wallstreetbets,Big gains will only matter when you have good financial health,4433.0,0.95

Sun, the 30 year-old entrepreneur who bought $10 million worth of GameStop Corp. at the height of its Reddit-fueled rally, is predicting a paradigm shift in investing as younger people swarm into financial assets.

Sun said he‚Äôs prepared to hold onto his GameStop shares that he purchased near the highs late last month üíéüñê in an effort to tap into the adrenaline-charged rush that lured retail investors into so-called meme stocks. He also bought $1 million in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and a further $1 million in silver. The GameStop position is now worth just $2 million, Sun said.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to hold. Even if I lose money on the GME stock, I still believe this is a paradigm shift,‚Äù Sun said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúIn the past we all followed the advice from the financial analysts, and these days people are going to make their own decisions.‚Äù

misium500,0.0,4211.0," Well, as I predicted, they kept the price over $50 so that the stack of 10,000 (yes, ten thousand options) Put contracts didn't get executed. That tells me that they aren't just tanking the price, and that they are playing the options spread at the moment.

It also tells me that they are scared shitless of shares needing to be delivered and taken off of the open market. They'd rather keep the price boosted over $50 to stop delivery than to risk an extra 1,000,000 shares getting into long hands.

But, thankfully, that also let's us know that they're still playing the game. If they were giving up and going into all-or-nothing mode, they wouldn't give a shit about the deliveries. They'd either flood the market with 25,000,000 FTDs while tanking the price to cover at $20 while hoping they have enough left over for the fines... Or they'd cash out what they have left now and file for bankruptcy while leaving the clearing houses to pay the bad debt.

No, they're still planning on finding the cheapest way out of this without any (or minimal) legal trouble. That means we're still getting paid. (Eventually...)

I've been watching this for a while now, and I think I've gotten a hand on what they are doing. This coming week will be the tell-all... And I'm going to explain why I believe the price can only go up...

So. Let's crunch the 2/19 option chain and see where this train is headed... - This Week, oooon Gaaaaaame Theeeeory!... *queue intro music*...

Current price $52:

Put ITM: 59,434

Put OTM: 346,288

Call ITM: 29,930

Call OTM: 87,111

At Current Price, a total of 89,364 option contracts are ITM.

Now, let's look at possible price movement. See, they are keeping Gee em eee at the line of demarcation between the single-dollar price change contracts ($41-$42-$43-et al.)... And the five-dollar price change per contract ($50-$55-$60-et al.)

That means that for every dollar that the stock drops, it executes a new Put option contract... But it would need to climb five dollars to execute a new call option. That's why I told you in the last thread that they are playing between the $50-$54.99 range all week.

See, because of the contract price structuring, it actually costs them MORE to knock the price down any lower. Allow me to explain:

Lets look at both the Call and Put sides of the option chain... And for the nearest $10 swing in prices...

There are 29,337 Put Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 2,459 Put Options for $51-$59 strike.

There are 13,187 Call Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 3,066 Call Options for $51-$59 strike.

Now, lemme explain why I believe this matters in predicting where the price is going to drift this week.

If the price were to drop by $10, the net difference would be an ADDITIONAL 16,150 options that would be executed because of the contract price structuring. 10 Put Options would become in the money.

Conversely, if the price went UP by $9, the net difference would be 507 extra contracts that would be able to be executed. Because of the price structuring, only two new Call Option strikes would be able to be executed between $55-$59.

If we were to just look at the next five Put Option contracts below the current strike price, it equals up to 22,175. That means if the price were to DROP $5, they would need to find delivery for an EXTRA 2,217,500 shares.

If the price were to go UP by $5, they would only need to find 85,600 extra shares to cover the extra contracts that would be ITM at $55.

Let me say that again. If the price goes DOWN... It takes MORE shares off the market because of the Put Options going in dollar increments, while the Call Options go up in $5 increments.

It is also interesting to note that ending the week at $59 would cause less deliveries than ending at $55.

My hypothesis: They can't hold the price at $50 this upcoming week simply due to the lack of shares available and the buyer demand staying so consistent. We only had 12mil-13mil volume the last two days. The shares are drying up.

So if they can't hold the price steady, they need to decide which direction to move it. And based on the math, moving the price UP would save the shorts money by causing the lesser of two evils in extra deliveries.

But one thing is for sure. They can't let the price tank any lower this upcoming week. It would trigger too many new deliveries.

(There's actually some serious game theory that says the best move to trigger the squeeze would be for us to ALLOW the price to drop to exactly $39.99 at close of next week... as odd as that seems)

So what's my non-financially-advising-crystal-ball predict that this weeks close will be on 2/19?...

$58.47...

They are going to allow some big single-day swings Tuesday and Wednesday to send the stock price from $52 up to tickle the $60 mark so that they can go balls-deep selling $60C Premium... And then they will hold the price just below the line.

The next target after that would be $69 (giggity), as there is a large off-set of Calls vs Puts at $70 that would cause the delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again. I just don't think they're going to let us get $19 in a single week, as that would cause retail investor interest to start going up again.

Tl;dr: We end next week at $58-$59 and the slow bleeding continues until the week of Feb 26.

The idea is that the hedge funds that shorted GME could have shorted ETF's that contain GME while simultaneous cover GME.

Averos_,0.0,4133.0,"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This winter I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into agricultural blackberry futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about David H. Murdock, CEO of Dole, and his pseudo-monopoly over bananas, I decided to do something similar with another fruit. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's blackberry yield would be smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in Central Mexico and a colder-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around the middle of January and prices skyrocketed, but the blackberry bubble burst on on January 28th. Unfortunately, the recent concerns over high-flying stocks driven up by large short covering caused a massive drop-off in demand due to the futures being associated with a Canadian technology company of the same name, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of February 8th, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive blackberry shipment from the Mexican state of Jalisco, scheduled for early May, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in March, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the blackberries in this shipment were absolutely gargantian, some topping 20 grams each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per kilo.

If you think Robinhood sounds bad, eToro is Vlad's haircut level of fucked.   


The solution to the problem, in eToro's eyes, is now to increase the minimum deposit for new users (up to $1,000 from $250 earlier this year), and to stop allowing placing order requests for market open. Not to increase server capacity, just to squeeze people a little more. Withdrawal requests already were a travesty (over two weeks in most cases), but now there is an upper limit on withdrawals at one time too. If you have an issue, be prepared to wait 14 days minimum for a response, which will be copy/pasted and ignore the issue before having your ticket closed.

cfiznuts,0.0,3867.0,"Upcoming GME ‚ÄúPossible‚Äù Catalysts

There are some great Due Diligence posts out there regarding the short percentage on GME, the hiding of the shorts game with An ETF that cannot be named here and other ETF‚Äôs, and the AI model of where GME could moon at because of this.  I encourage everyone to search and read all these posts as I encourage all investors to research anything they are investing in.  They are great reads put together by apes with many more wrinkles on their brain than I have.  These posts explain out the different methods that people who are going to lose a lot of money are using against retail.  The high frequency trading, the media, and the schill accounts.

We all know why we are here, duh it‚Äôs cause ‚Äúwe like the stock‚Äù. Here is some possible catalyst information everyone should know about.  Any one of these things could be the catalyst that starts the squeeze or they could just bomb. We don‚Äôt know exactly what will start the frenzy. What we do know is that costs to hold shorts will need to increase and shares need to be called in before the shorters find that line where it‚Äôs no longer cost effective to hold their position and they have to buy at any cost and we get our tendies.  So here is a list of certain key items coming up.

1.  This weekend has created another major round of buzz concerning GME which started with the Congressional House Services Financial Committee Hearing on Thursday.  Then it really hit when u/deepfuckingvalue followed up to his response to the Congressman that he still though GME was a great value at its current price and then Friday put his money where his mouth is and bought another 50K shares.  Fucking legend.  That buzz has led into a lot of chatter this weekend that could start a FOMO buy on Monday.  A FOMO could drive the price which will cause the borrow rate of shorts to skyrocket and could cause lenders to start pulling back shares.  This ‚Äúmight‚Äù be all the catalyst we need to see the moon.

2. An ETF that cannot be named here is being used and a way for shorters to short GME since the fund holds GME stock as a part of it portfolio.  If State Street performs quarterly balancing and reallocations of their ETF their could be a call back of shares.  Honestly we don‚Äôt know if this will happen since none of us know the inner working of exactly what they are going to do but this could be the start of events that squeeze GME.

3. GME releases the quarterly earning on March 24th.  This report includes the sale of both new consoles as well as the Christmas rush.  In fact many stores opened back up after Covid lockdowns in the 4th quarter.  We also don‚Äôt know if any other information will be released at the time of the earnings report since they have been very tight lipped during this whole run other than announcing some new people that are going to help move GameStop in a new direction.

4.  Annual call back of shares prior to the June 2021 annual meeting.  In the months leading up to annual shareholder meetings many stocks end up becoming ‚ÄúHard to Borrow‚Äù with additional rates and fees to borrow them.  The reason for this is that people who lend out shares do not get a vote at the annual shareholders meeting.  You can go back and research this historically for many companies and a quick google search will show you that last year GME shares had to be called back prior to 4/20/20 in order to vote at the shareholders meeting.  With all eyes on GME this year and the corporate changes my feeling is that this year will be no different.  I just hope the use the same callback date of 4/20 for obvious reasons.  The shareholders meeting is in June this year and I think it will be a great time for retail investors to go meet and greet since we know when we get together it will be one hell of a party.

Like I said I am not claiming any one of these things will happen or cause a catalyst but I thought it was important to get these things out in the open so everyone had an understanding of upcoming events.  Like it is repeated over and over again we don‚Äôt know when the squeeze will occur because we don‚Äôt know the shorters positions and where they feel their line is on cost to hold vs cost to give us our tendies. All we know is when it happens hold on.

Thank you for reading, hope you are all well informed.  Please do outside research and don‚Äôt rely on any one person as this is not financial advice.  I‚Äôm just a fellow ape holding GME that‚Äôs eats the crayons my wife‚Äôs boyfriend brings me when he comes over.  I prefer the orange crayons. I am not a cat. I like the stock. I thank you for the opportunity to bring you this information as it‚Äôs great information however I don‚Äôt have any good stories about growing up as a small child in Bulgaria.

RainAlwaysComes,0.0,3719.0,"I've been a longtime lurker in this sub, even before I grew a pair and started dipping my toes into the market.  The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  

I only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn't too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  

I don't listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don't blindly trust DD.  

Why I feel I need to post today:  
The mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don't know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.

I've seen some DD that suggests it's a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that's the case, I don't think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don't just lose your diamond hands on a whim.

I've seen other DD that suggests it's a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I'm  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). 

What conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.  And unfortunately, I think it's starting to work.  Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.  

I love this community.  I hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference.  When it comes to money, it's easy to manipulate peoples feelings.  I just hope that in the end, Apes Together Strong is the sentiment.

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moonüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/)

Zanko95,0.0,3662.0,"I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.

Their reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.

To preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout ""market manipulation"" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).

The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:

My screenshot (02/05/2021):

The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.

Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on ""updating data"".

I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.

However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.

Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.

My screenshot (02/06/2021):

As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).

In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.

I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?

There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.

Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.

Thoughts.

P.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.

P.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!

Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:

""Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn‚Äôt up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.

Are you certain the chart isn‚Äôt updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I‚Äôll resolve your ticket but I‚Äôm still here if you reply.""

I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say ""oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more ""accurate"" measurements to our users"". Ya know?

**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**

**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.

His post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**

And for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**

So their excuse is a ""programming error"". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).

Natural_Profession_8,0.0,3664.0,"Hi WSB, I've seen a lot of people talking about gamma squeezes recently, but I haven't seen anyone explain the math correctly. In fact, even the recent [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/05/gamestopgamestonk-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-madness-of-crowds/) got the concept wrong. So I figured I'd sit down this fine Saturday morning and put together a post on the actual mathematics of a gamma squeeze. I'll talk about options concepts such as the Greeks, but I won't go into so much detail that you'd need to understand the [Black-Scholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) equation or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

**Market makers**

The first thing you need to understand is who is on the other side of your trade when you buy a call option. Typically, this is *not* some other trader or hedge fund that wants to inverse your bet. Instead, the counter-party is what we call a [market maker](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp). Market makers profit from providing liquidity to markets, *not* from taking directional positions. In practice, what this means is that market makers charge you a slight premium, and then position themselves so that no matter what happens, their premium is preserved. This positioning is called hedging.

&amp;#x200B;

**How market makers hedge call options**

There are infinite ways that market makers could theoretically hedge against the calls they sell. However, by far the simplest and most prevalent way is to buy some amount of shares of the underlying stock. Remember that 1 options contract = 100 actual options. 

***However, here's the part I think a lot of you are misunderstanding: market makers do not buy 100 shares of the underlying for every option contract they sell you. This would not be a hedged position! This would be equivalent to the market maker having a covered call on the stock, which is a bullish/neutral strategy, and will lose money if the underlying declines!***

The last thing a market maker would ever want to do is take a bullish position on the meme stocks that they are selling you options on. So how do market makers actually hedge?

To understand how market makers *actually* hedge, first you need to understand two options concepts, delta and gamma. 

**Delta**

The *delta* of an option represents how much the option would increase if the underlying increased by $1. So a delta of 0.3 means that for every $1 the underlying stock moves up, the option will go up by 30 cents. Remember that the initial price of the call option is much less than the stock, so that 30 cent increase is a much higher % increase than the corresponding increase in the stock. 

As an example, you may have paid $10 for a call option with a $100 strike on a stock that is currently trading for $50. If the delta on this option is 0.5, then if the stock moves to $51 dollars, the option will be worth \~$10.50. So, the stock moves up 2%, and the option moves up 5%.

A key thing to know about delta is that it is not constant. It varies based on the changes in price of the underlying stock. In fact, as you can see in the chart below, delta is lowest for deep out-of-the-money calls, and highest for deep in-the-money calls.

&amp;#x200B;

[Delta as a function of strike price \(the strike here is $300\)](https://preview.redd.it/fds5k58a6gl61.png?width=242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5e2d94357b54a0057aadc2e890ee1dccf26924c)

Without going into too much technical detail as to why, just note that this makes intuitive sense. If a stock is worth $100 and you have an option to buy it for a strike of $1 (deep deep deep in-the-money), then that option should be worth \~$99 and basically move exactly in tandem with the stock (i.e., have a delta \~1). Whereas, if you have an option you paid $1 for, which gives you the right to buy that same stock for a strike of $1,000, delta has to be very low. Otherwise (say delta was 1), every small 1% change in the stock would cause your option's price to double.

**Gamma**

*Gamma* is closely related to delta. Gamma represents how much the delta changes as the underlying stock moves up or down. So, in the chart above, gamma is the slope of the curve (In fact, if you know calculus, the simplest explanation of delta and gamma is that delta is the first derivative of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying stock, and gamma is the second derivative).

While delta is highest when calls are deep in-the-money, gamma is actually highest when calls are exactly at-the-money. You can see this by noticing that the slope of the curve in the graph above is steepest at exactly the strike price ($300). This slope is gamma.

The graph below shows this even more clearly. The red line is delta, and the blue line is gamma.

&amp;#x200B;

[Plots of delta and gamma for a call option with a $25 strike price](https://preview.redd.it/bbvos2md8gl61.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b21bdf2bd9d662d2347e84175b69c211c23ee785)

**Delta-neutral strategies**

Ok, now we're ready to understand how market makers hedge. Market makers employ [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp) strategies. This means that their overall position will have a delta of zero with respect to the stock price (a stock always has a delta of 1 with respect to itself of course). So how do they do this?

They do this by selling you a call option, and then buying just enough shares to maintain a delta-neutral position. They then constantly adjust their position, buying or selling more shares as the delta of the option increases or decreases. They can do this because they are large institutions who can trade quickly with little cost.

The best way to understand this is with an example:

$GME is currently trading at \~$137. You buy the Mar 19 2021 $150 call option, which is currently trading for $26.73 and has these greeks:

&amp;#x200B;

[GME Mar 19 2021 $150c](https://preview.redd.it/3p5vr652agl61.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6eefca1ecde4ae4c76f5d4c870212b5b48c3402e)

A market maker takes the other side of this trade. When they sell you the option, they now have a delta of -0.498 for each option, and since options contracts trade in groups of 100, their overall delta is -49.8. Let's call is -50 for simplicity.

In order to be delta-neutral, they need to balance this position with securities that have a delta of 50 with respect to GME. The simplest way to do this is buy shares. Each share of GME has a delta of 1 with respect to GME. So the market maker buys 50 shares of GME. Now their overall position is this:

*Position = 50 x (GME shares) - 1 x (GME Mar 19 $150c options contract)*

and their overall delta is *-50 + 50 = 0*

There are two important things to note about this:

(1) The market maker wasn't forced to buy 100 shares of GME, like I've seen many users on here claim. Instead, they will only buy 50 shares.

(2) Your trade cost you *$26.73 x 100 = $2,673,* and caused the market maker to buy *$137 \* 50 = $6,850* worth of GME shares. This is approximately 2.5x leverage.

**Market maker repositioning**

Remember that, as the stock price moves up or down, the delta of the option that the market maker sold you changes. The market maker wants to maintain a delta-neutral position, so they will rebalance their position by buying or selling shares.

Let's continue with the example above, and assume that GME has gone up $2 and now trades at $139. According to the greeks in the table above, the new delta of the option will be approximately *0.498 + 2 x 0.0077 = 0.5134.* Remember that there are 100 options in a contract, so the delta of the contract is now *51.34*. If the market maker maintains their initial position of 50 GME shares, they will end up with a delta of *-1.34* with respect to GME. To avoid this, they need to purchase 1.34 shares of GME.

Market makers will thus constantly adjust the number of shares they are holding in order to maintain delta-neutral positions. They incur some cost doing this, because the more volatile the stock is, the less quickly and efficiently the market makers can hedge. But they still make money overall, because they've charged you a premium for the option that takes this into account. This is why they charge you a higher premium for volatile stocks.

**Gamma squeezes**

Now we are finally in a position to discuss gamma squeezes. Now that you understand how market makers hedge, the rest is very simple. As the underlying stock goes up, market makers that have sold you call options will buy more stock in order to maintain a delta-neutral position. The amount of stock they have to buy is proportional to how much the delta of the options changes, which is just gamma. And gamma is at its highest when options contracts are at-the-money.

And so, when there are a ton of call options on a stock, price increases in the stock cause market makers to buy even more of the stock, and the rate of buying is highest when the option contract is at-the-money. *This is the gamma squeeze.*

Notice that the inverse is also true; when the stock price decreases, the delta of the options decreases, and market makers sell stock in order to maintain delta-neutrality.

**Epilogue: a note on leverage**

Now you understand gamma squeezes and how market makers hedge. You can actually use this information to determine exactly how much share buying you are causing when you buy a call option. Using this and the option price, we can actually calculate how much purchasing leverage you have when buying an option.

The formula is this:

*Purchasing leverage = (delta \*  (stock price)) / (options price)*

For example:

&amp;#x200B;

*Options contract 1: Deep in-the-money*

*March 19 2021 40c: $101 price, 1.0 delta*

*Purchasing leverage = (1 \* 137) / 101 = 1.36*

&amp;#x200B;

*Options contract 2: Deep out-of-the-money*

*March 19 2021 300c: $8.15 price, 0.0283 delta*

*Purchasing leverage = (0.0283 \* 137) / 8.15 = 0.475*

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, some deep deep out-of-the-money options are currently selling at such a high price that some of them actually have purchasing leverage of less than 1x. This is really unusual, but shows how volatile GME is. However, options that are closer to the strike price but still out-of-the-money still have high leverage, like the $150 March 19th options with 2.5x leverage. I haven't calculated which options have the highest purchasing power leverage since that's a lot of number crunching for a Saturday morning (but maybe someone in the comments can?)

Anyway, do with this information what you will WSB. Godspeed

So, the stock market is at all-time high and interest rates are at an all-time low. Meanwhile, there's half a pandemic going on in the country because at least 14 states are planning to reopen. At the same time Congress wants to borrow a bloated $1.9 Trillion budget to splurge on hookers and blow.

Happy times are here again...

Unfortunately, the fundamentals of companies are starting to solidify and they don't need the easy money with the economy reopening. The economy has a government spending hangover and wants interest prices to increase before hyperinflation appears.

However, Government promised a whole lotta freebies during the election and now people have turned up with pockets turned out waiting for their share.

The Fed decides it's not going to raise interest rates but fundamentals don't give a damn. Buyers don't want to buy worthless bonds and the government ""prints"" money by issuing bonds.

A classic catch-22...

Congress can't borrow $1.9 Trillion unless the Treasury issues more bonds. Investors won't buy the bonds unless the interest rate increases. If interest rates increase it becomes more expensive for everybody to borrow.

Basically...

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0n9cfhbeg2l61.gif

The yield bonds are increasing on their own because of all the inflation stuffed into the market over the past year. All the hedge funds who shorted GME and AMC are now in trouble. All their borrowed shares just got more expensive to hold and there's nothing they can do about it.

My hunch is today's sell off is a desperate money grab to try to keep the GME price down to keep their interest down. (At the time of writing this GME is rising)

Before they were slowly bleeding out money. Now they've nicked an artery it's gushing out.

TL;DR Raising bond yields means hedge funds have to pay more in interest to borrow stocks and they're doing a fire sale to cover their bets.

edit: I can't spell.

edit 2: The treasury issues bonds, not the fed. I was confused because Janet Yellen is everywhere. First at the fed, then in Citadel's pocket, now at the treasury. My bad.

Melvin and friends thought that GameStop was a failing company, so they decided to short it's stock. They got so greedy, they decided that they would short the company by more stock than actually existed (naked short selling),  such was their confidence that GameStop was worthless.

The very act of doing this, if it hadn't been discovered might very well have driven Gamestop into bankruptcy, with the company still being viable.

When a company goes bankrupt, the short sellers don't haver to buy back or return the stock, so if GameStop had been driven into bankruptcy, this dirty illegal tactic they used might never have been exposed. By not having to buy the stock back, they make maximum profit on their short trade, and don't even have to pay any taxes on their profits. This is a short sellers wet dream.

Tens of thousands of people lose their jobs, homes get repossessed, suicides increase, families devastated, all while Melvin and his buddies eat caviar, sip champagne on balconies and count their ill gotten gains. It really is the devil's work what they do.

But now that the hedgie's devious ways have been exposed and shared with apes allover the world, Melvin and his friends can never drive GameStop into the ground, so they will be forced to buy back the shares at some stage. And because they were so greedy by naked short selling, now they have to buy back more shares than actually exist. They sold fake counterfeit shares, but they need to buy back real shares, the shares we own.

So even if you only hold 1 share, they need it. They need to buy every single share that actually exists to cover their position. And that is why 1 share of GameStop is worth whatever price you're willing to sell for, even if it's $500k and above.

For the last few weeks, Melvin and friends have been using even dirtier tactics, trying to fool us all into thinking that they do not need our shares.

Do not fall for this. They will use every psychological tactic they can to convince you to sell. Manipulating the price, turning off the buy button via RobinHood, paying media to say they have already covered etc. They are going to be using even dirtier tactics over the coming weeks,  some that we haven't event thought of yet.

All we need to do is hold ; nothing else, and get on with life.

No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.

Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!

Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.

[Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d)

Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say ""OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE"" but I noticed something from another ""penny stock"" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.

[Figure 2: Same plot for different stock, showing similar trends as SNDL.](https://preview.redd.it/f5a16zi7tzg61.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d631425582fb2593c9041ecc90805bdd2e231861)

Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!

So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day **IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together** towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!
* If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.
* IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow, MAYBE

**Edit 1:** Added the links to where you can find the volume txt files, but I've been having issues with the FINRA site, have to clear the browser sometimes or it takes you to a login screen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 2:** Was asked to see how my ""theory"" checks out with today's dip in TLRY:

[Edit 2.5: Updated the TLRY data out to Jan 11th, and HOLY SHIT! Only Time the 3 markets sync up and peak is when the price plummets!](https://preview.redd.it/h5yrk8dof0h61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7c89947359119453a375ee37a56578d524a18ed)

**Edit 3:**  BoatyMcBoatFace -4:30am 16% !!! 5am -13%, 9am -20%, 9:25am -13%, **10:30am -18%, Noon - 15%, 1pm - 15%, 2:45pm - 14%**

**Edit 4:** WELP.... -15%, I guessed 20% above, then 3 lines down I said 30%. Now gotta wait till 6pm to get FINRA numbers to see what the 3 volumes looked like.

**Edit 5:** FINAL EDIT, with all the market volumes falling. No idea what it means when they all dip still fairly tight like that, need to go through more data.

Though it was only a month ago, /u/TheEmperorOfJenks transformed himself into a eternal meme here on WSB that ripples to this day. The man who [lost his life savings on ornamental gourd futures.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/) This is one of the strangest and most hilarious ways I‚Äôve seen someone YOLO, so I decided to follow the story for the next month. What happened after that has kept me in utter awe. Within a month, losing his ass on gourdy bois might actually be the least autistic thing he‚Äôs done in 2021.

Since he had to take physical possession of so many of these gigantic, worthless gourds, he tried his best to make lemons into lemonade. He first investigated [how to make them into instruments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gourds/comments/l0o9za/market_potential_for_gourd_instruments_in_great/)Then, he fully embraced the autist inside him and began to eat his loss. Literally. [He found a way to eat ornamental gourds,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gourds/comments/ld1p3z/ive_found_out_how_to_make_gourds_edible/) which could only be done by boiling them for 3+ hours. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can eat fence posts with this method as well.

After eating gourds and likely getting massive constipation, he tried his hands at sportsbetting. In a now deleted post, [he said he had a straight up bet of $1,000 for the Kansas City Chiefs to win the Super Bowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/leyru3/there_is_absolutely_no_way_kansas_city_will_lose/). This was the last of his money.

Then, he had a brilliant idea. A magnum opus to follow his gourds bet. Rhodium. As one might expect from someone who ruined their financial future to god damn gourds, [he declared that Rhodium was going to hit $40k in 2 months, after it just mooned to $20k](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lac1oy/rhodium_is_skyrocketting_invest_now_for_ultimate/) It‚Äôs the classic buy high sell low strategy. In reality, [the price has only gone up 15%](https://www.metalsdaily.com/live-prices/pgms/) a full 85% under his prediction. So he went full retard.

Using a credit card, [he bought 8.5 grams of what he was told was Rhodium for $4,000.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lac1oy/rhodium_is_skyrocketting_invest_now_for_ultimate/glodjo5/) And then it gets fun.

As Rhodium rocketed up a startling 2%, instead of buying a Lambo, [he asked where he could buy a custom water bed with his expected windfall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lajuas/where_to_buy_custom_water_beds/) It literally couldn‚Äôt go tits up.

[Then his ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù arrived.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lckk4r/my_rhodium_just_arrived/) But instead of looking like a polished, precisely packaged piece of metal, like other precious metal commodities, he got a lump of discolored metal in a plastic bag. The commenters of /r/Bullion immediately questioned its authenticity. So, he went to the experts. [He went to What Is This Rock with his $4,000 investment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisrock/comments/lfhu93/is_this_rhodium/) Everyone commented that it was bunk and likely pyrite. When asked where he bought it, [he gave a link to a shady Slovakian version of Wish](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisrock/comments/lfhu93/is_this_rhodium/gmndl5v/), clearly the experts in precious metal futures. Shockingly, the listing was now gone, along with the storefront on the super trustworthy .sk site.

Then, a trip to a local metals store in Tulsa confirmed it. [He paid $4,000 for a worthless piece of pyrite.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lktedl/it_wasnt_rhodium/) He has gone post silent since then, but the damage is there. Since losing $10k to gourds, he lost another $5k on sportsbetting and a precious metals scam. [He states that he is now moving to Uruguay to start over.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

I, for one, cannot wait to see the next chapter in this story. When we see Spanish newspaper articles about an American in Uruguay who went $500,000 in debt betting against freshwater eel futures, we know who is responsible.

**BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**

Option holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.

This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).

It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.

There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.

AMC has A LOT MORE: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.

BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.

NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.

Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).

Everyone have a great weekend.

When I bought them the buy price was 8.5 and sell 0. Yes 0. I thought that was because they were just so far OTM. Today I watched Tesla tank and neither the buy or sell price moved. I looked at some of the other Tesla options available on IG (there's only a really random assortment available, not a whole chain). I realized they were all 10000+ and calls at 60000 were something like 5x the price of puts at 60000. I'm now convinced that for some stupid reason IG prices option strikes in cents for equities (I have traded VIX options with them before and they're priced in dollars). So I'm 99% sure I just YOLO'd into $6 puts. I can't sell them cause they're worth exactly 0. I can't believe I've been so stupid.

Edit 2: called them back when the market opened. The guy again told me they were $600 I asked him to check so he did and came back and said yes they're $6 but as they're sold in sets of 100 that's why all the strike prices are x100. Go figure?

My interest in investing in $ROPE has also decreased. I just realized that in my 7 years of ""investing"", I have never actually realized a profit. If my account had green, I'd always think let's enjoy some gains just for a day or two, and then it would tank as soon as I'd want to cash out a bit. This isn't even a casino at this point, I am simply just making charitable donations which are then gambled by other retards. I have even managed to lose money in real estate in Vancouver, where pretty much everyone and their wifes boyfriend has made money. 

I came to the realization that this is all a game and it could not possibly be real. The game isn't rigged, its fake! This must be a simulation. As soon as I click buy, the stock tanks, if I invest in a property the market tanks, even when I pick fruits/veggies at the market they expire instantly, when I hop in the shower the water turns freezing cold. Anyone else feel like this???

If 2 retards who are experiencing this did the opposite of eachother, would one of them make money? Or would this possibly end the simulation as both aren't actually allowed to make money?

I have been seeing posts about $SEARS going public on March 10th and I am ecstatic because I truly believe that it will blow up.

I have been a part of the $SEARS community for quite some time and know all the ins and outs of how it works.

Another person and I have developed 3 $SEARS games that average a mediocre number of 500 players in total during good times of the day. Let me tell you, the games are absolute dog shit but people still play it and spend money on it. It wasn't easy to make as scripting is quite hard and I'm retarded, but the games are so bad yet children still play it.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, that is a respectable amount of money considering I split the profits 50/50 and haven't updated the game in literal months.

Kids spend stupid amounts of money on this platform.

# You might be thinking that it isn't that impressive, but oooh boy I'm just getting started.

But first, let me get into the details of how $SEARS actually works because it doesn't seem like many people understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

# How $SEARS works

$SEARS makes money from people spending money on their membership called 'Premium' or from people buying their in-game currency called Robux.

Using the Robux, players can buy items from the catalogue whether it's shirts, gear or hats/accessories. They can also buy in-game powerups for different games.

**Everything is community-made**, from the hats and accessories to shirts and games. $SEARS used to be the only one able to make hats but recently has implemented a system where you can apply to be able to make hat/accessory models. $SEARS has made a few games for sponsorships but they are usually worse than the player-made ones.

**Now for how people make money.**

$SEARS has a system called DevEx aka Developer Exchange where developers convert their Robux into actual real-life currency. The currency exchange rate is 0.0035 USD/Robux. There are some restrictions like not being able to exchange Robux that was bought with your own money or not being able to exchange Robux that was made from trading. For more info visit: [https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203314100-Developer-Exchange-DevEx-FAQs](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203314100-Developer-Exchange-DevEx-FAQs)

Basically, when someone purchases something you made, you get Robux from it but $SEARS takes a pre-determined % of the Robux spent and sends it into the void so that they don't have to pay you as much if you DevEx. This number is usually 30%.

**$SEARS isn't just a game, it's an entire fucking economy.**

$SEARS is interesting because unlike traditional online development, you don't have to pay money to keep up servers.

**You can make anything that you want (granted that it's not against TOS) for absolutely free.**

# Now, for the juicy stuff

This will not only dwarf my puny numbers but will also show how big, and how much bigger $SEARS is planning to be.

One thing that I have seen is people talking about how much top $SEARS developers make and the numbers are usually around 40k a month. While it depends on how top you are talking about, let me just give you an example of how much $SEARS developers make.

# In 2019, a single $SEARS developer made 50 million USD

Not only that, but a single game has hit 1.6 million concurrent players. A single game.

I got all of this information from the 2020 $SEARS Developer Conference. [https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/](https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/)

But that's not all from the conference. From the conference, we got a chart of milestones from $SEARS CEO, David Baszucki, is trying to hit.

&amp;#x200B;

[Note that only the checkmarks mean that it has already happened. Thumbs up means that it is on track.](https://preview.redd.it/vzbeykpuffj61.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb544d5496049a3bd14bce8db3cad31e1896db6a)

A funny one I saw was the Tesla one. I already know how much ya'll love sucking off Tesla and Elon.

They are also adding a website where you can hire scripters, modellers and sound designers.

Another thing that is coming soon that will boost players is updates to the game development engine called Studio.

$SEARS is constantly made fun of for having shitty games and granted, that's not wrong but there are quite a few really good games out there that look pretty nice. With the new updates coming, games will look better than ever.

Here's a look at what the new terrain materials and textures will look like. They don't even look like $SEARS anymore and people won't be taking $SEARS as a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oqxk4drokfj61.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3858b3a2d2531c941fb738e80f698700288b7e24

Because of this, I believe that more and more people will look to get into game development on $SEARS and skyrocket its profits.

**TL;DR $SEARS is growing at a rapid rate, one person made 50 million USD from developing $SEARS games in a year, and $SEARS CEO, David Baszucki has huge aspirations for the company which is why I will be going balls deep into $SEARS stock when it goes public.**

Also, I have no idea why everyone's calling it $SEARS

On March 19th 2021 is another rare [Quadruple Witching.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp)

This is a once in a quarter event where stock futures, stock options, stock index options and stock futures all expire simultaneously. This can, by it's nature, create huge volatility.

Let's have a look at a REAL company and the outstanding call contracts with the most open interest.

**$TSLA - March 12th**

OK, so these are mega-caps and we're seeing a 10x increase in options contracts on March 19th.

And let's try a less sexy-big stock

**$WMT (Walmart) - March 12th**

AMC have more options calls than TSLA right now for March 19th and over 10x Walmart. They have about 50% APPLE (Ok you know how big Apple is guys?)

YES, that is 127,885 contracts at a $5 strike. HUGE. If this hits $5 it could just as easy keep going.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***TLDRish**

The theory: Get on your tin foil hats.I think 'someone' or many 'somepeoples' have discovered the incredible power of near-term options and their influence on the upward volatility on price.

As more options are bought near-the-money it causes a delta spike as market makers buy shares to hedge. This normally isn't enough to do much- but add in some magical ingredients including but not limited to: highly volatile stocks, heavy retail interest, significant short interest, a small float, inclusion in ETFs, INDEX FUNDS and other FUNDS.

As the price rises close to the strike price we also see some gamma spiking. Personally I think we saw delta hedging yesterday on Blackberry. Huge volumes around 11am.

So, PEOPLE, have discovered that just buying these heavy options, especially around volatile times, can influence the price likely more dollar-for-dollar than just buying the stock. It might be that many WSBers are literally in the right place at the right time.

**What does it all mean?** Hang onto your bananas. This thing is bigger than us. If the prices on some of these stocks rise they will need to be re-calibrated for weight for inclusion in their index funds. This creates a lot of buying and selling which exasperates the volatility further. The more volatility the more market makers have to hedge.

I think we are in for a once in a life time historical volatile ride. If you hold stock, you can ride it out and better time it. If you hold options you are really hoping your timing works well.

Something BIG is going to happen leading up to March 19th and the way the call contracts are organized creates a kind of series of landmines just waiting to be tripped. Each mine sends the price further and more volatile. What's more interesting is these stocks all seem to be related in a basket by the algo-computers. This does mean there is some degree of echo where what happens in AMC affects BB for instance. It might mean we see some double feedback happening as well. We did see it originally in January (and no one has been able to explain exactly WHY yet). I think January was a test... A proof of concept. The real prize is March 19th.

**GOOD LUCK...**

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. This is for informational and entertainment purposes only. The thoughts herein are my own. Do your own research. Do something nice for someone today.

Positions: I have some BB, NOK, calls and want to pick up some RKT calls and YOLO today. They're way up pre-market and looks like it's going to be expensive... but I particularly like this one due to the high insider ownership, stagnant pricing, low float, reasonable price volatility. This ones just primed.

**OOF, just cheeked $PLTR March 19th and it's massive too.**

A lot of moon landings coming!

On a last thought... What if GME is the catalyst for the next major crash by it's revealing of naked-shorts and fails to deliver? 2008 was all about Wall Street greed with mortgage backed securities... 2021 could be all about naked shorting and naked options writing... All meaning wall street has done it again by absorbing insane amounts of risk pursuing profits. This might all come to a head and create some systemic change that will benefit all. Damn, I'm feeling rather noble now about my own pursuits.

I have an interesting story to tell WSB today that i think my fellow ü¶ç will find amusing if not inspiring. Ive just got back home from my wageslave job as a stonemason, where we make granite/quartz worktops for people considerably richer than we are. 

The story goes as follows: today was just like any other wagecuck day goes boring, monotonous grinding/polishing kitchen tops. At one point there was a really big island worktop, or ""countertop"" as our American brothers may say. These granite worktops can be really heavy under certain circumstances and today this particular one was and it took two of us to lift it to put a table underneath it to support the granite. 

On the way down, laying the granite on the table the third man moved the table too close to mine and my co workers fingers, or lets say hands. Now despite the pain of a couple hundred kg of granite trapping my hands between it and the table, I remained calm. Yet on the other hand my co worker quickly pulled his hands out from underneath as it crushed his fingers essentially tearing his fingers open from the metal table and sharp granite. Nothing major just a few cuts. However yours truly, as I've said: remained calm and simply stated my hands were stuck under the granite, so after a bit of panic fellow co-workers managed to lift the heavy granite off and there my fingers were. Intacted. 

It was almost as if you could suggest ones hand was made of some material made from intense pressure???

So, the moral of the story is when under pressure the key is to remain calm and keep your eyes on the end goal. Then make sure don't get distracted and throw yourself to panic as you can very much make the whole situation worse than it actually is.

CoastalHotDog835,0.0,3177.0,"*Before I start this post, I want to apologise for the late DD. Last few days we've seen quite a change in options trading throughout the operating hours of the market and I wanted to use the latest data for this post so it wouldn't be misleading. To those that know me from my previous DD, you'd know I threw a dart blindfolded (and high on coke) to predict a squeeze on the 24th (Close enough, I'll take it). I've tried to keep this post short as possible because 90% of you retards have the attention span of a 2-month-old dog.*

Gamma Squeeze Quick Recap

**Gamma squeeze can begin when a large investor, typically referred to as a whale, buys short-dated call options**. The banks or brokers that sell the call options will typically buy the underlying stock so that they have very little or no net exposure. **The more call options the investor buys, the more shares the brokers that sold the options will have to buy to ensure they are net flat**. Brokers and dealers are motivated by the commissions and do not want to hold a trade either long or short. Given that these whales buy calls, the option purchases force the dealers to buy the underlying stock, which can push the share price higher. *If pulled off, this creates a positive feedback loop, thus can drive underlying stock(s) price higher for a period of time. In a roundabout way, the dealers must buy more and more of the underlying.*

When the price of the stock reaches above the strike price (In the Money), those who've bought the call options **may** exercise their right to buy the shares.

Why does this matter?

Well first let's look at the call options expiring this Friday (5th march) that are OTM currently. Just pretend to stare at the tables if you can't read, I'll explain later.

# Open Interest and IV

**Comparing the options chain between the two days, it could be seen that yesterday there was 43k in open interest in contrast to 0 on 2nd march. Why is this important?**

*Open interest gives you key information regarding the* *liquidity* *of an option, it reflects upon the number of contracts that are ACTIVELY held by investors and traders (These are the positions that have been opened and not closed yet).*

If there is no open interest in an option, there is no secondary market for that option. When options have a significant open interest, it means there are a large number of buyers and sellers out there. An active secondary market increases the odds of getting option orders filled at good prices. At its core, open interest paints a picture of how much capital is being injected into a given market. Keeping an eye on open interest is vital to identifying trends, in that growing open interest signifies that an influx of money is likely to stimulate action and aid price extension. Conversely, falling open interest alludes to activity ‚Äúdrying up‚Äù or capital exiting the market. This suggests that the presence of any prevailing trend is short-lived and adopting a reversal strategy may be the best course of action.

*All other things being equal, the bigger the open interest, the easier it will be to trade that option at a reasonable* *spread* *between the bid and ask.*

**Linking back to the GME options chain, a significant 43.04k call options (going long) accumulated yesterday when compared to 0 of the previous day (2nd March) .** The rising prices during the uptrend (as seen in the last few hours of the market on 3rd march) coupled with the rising open interest, can mean that new money is coming into the market and **can be a sign of bullish sentiment.**

Another point I'd like to make is the implied volatility which is extremely high for the options chains with a strike price above $150 (Yes I'm looking at you Mr. $800). As expectations, or demand, rises for an option, the implied volatility (IV) increases proportionally and leads to a higher option premium due to the risky nature of the option. **Why would any sensible investor buy 9.7k calls with a 906% IV if the stock was bound to plummet**? And no, calls these huge are *probably not* bought by retail traders or people YOLOing. There's something larger at play and will probably require another post for institutional funds and hedgies ownership in GME (Trying to keep it on topic for now). The only viable reason I see is that large whales or investors see the potential for another gamma squeeze before the end of the week.

EDIT 2: Took a look at the gamma squeeze predictor tool made by [u/indonesian\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) and will link the post here as well

The post is pretty self-explanatory and gets deep down into the numbers if anyone is interested. It also provides a numerical value that backs the theory mentioned above. Take a look and fill in your üçåüçå.

*Disclaimer: Writing calls/puts do not have a direct impact on the price of the stock and only matter when the contracts are ITM and exercised. What I've mentioned above is a trend that I've noticed from the fundamentals of the option chain for GME. Do I think last week's squeeze is about to repeat itself? Yes. Should you take my word for it? Probably not a great idea, I wrote this at 4 am on a caffeine high. People need to realise that these call options only matter if they're In the Money (ITM) and can expire worthless if they're Out The money (OTM).*

# Last week's squeeze

I guess we can all agree last week's gamma squeeze was due to the market makers (MM) ""delta"" hedging strategy that seeks to be directionally neutral by establishing offsetting long and short positions in the same underlying assets.

Reaching ITM strike prices causes a surge in volume that is due to the calls being exercised. **If the stock reaches $150, that may cause an increase of 567k volume which will it boost it to the $200's and so on... (Domino effect)** Now what I'm stating isn't something new and has probably been mentioned by other users on this concept already. However, the volume of call options being expired is significant at the current stock price. Just to put it into perspective, **last week's gamma squeeze that was initiated by call options ITM had:**

*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*

*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*

*Looking at the charts from last week, the spikes in the price directly correlated to options being exercised at the $55 and %120 strike price not to mention the volume increase due to FOMO and hype.* Comparing last week's data to 3rd march option chain:

*the open contracts at $150 are alone worth more than last week's.*

*567k shares at $150 = $85Million*

*2.57M shares at $800= $2.06 Billion*

**Please note the strike prices mentioned above are OTM currently and have been taken for comparison as per speculations if the stock price hits $150 by friday.**

Huge value right? At this point, I won't be surprised if someone comes out and slaps me in the face because I would do the same to myself after looking at those numbers. Anyways, the point being is the week is similarly set up for a gamma squeeze like last week IF the $150 options are ITM by Friday. **Now, this is a big IF and it can go either way**, but if it does happen we'll be seeing the price skyrocket to the fucking moon just from the options being exercised.

**TL;DR -**

**High Calls OI coupled with increase in stock price shows bullish sentiment, this is reinforced with the increased Implied volatility for the options. Open interest at $800 is huge**

**We might see a similar domino effect as calls could be exercised if they become ITM when the stock price reaches $150 that will ultimately push it to $200+ and so on.**

Well you know the drill, now i'm out of coke and lost my last two remaining brain cells on this post. If I've messed up the calculations or numbers, please feel free to roast my ass so I've got the decency to edit and make them accurate. **Also, I'm no financial advisor and people should do their own research if they believe in a company**, what I've based this DD on is the trends I saw last week as well and is totally speculative at this point.

1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren‚Äôt even covering at the time.
2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that‚Äôs 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies)
3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to &lt;100
TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain‚Äôt finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65. 
In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten buttfucked to begin with.

However, I wasn‚Äôt convinced with that because the price kept going up for a bit (someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong please).

PS: Question to those who are up to date with the GME numbers: Say if it‚Äôs true that Melvin exited all their positions, can it be argued that these $350 million of uncovered worth of shares were placed when GME hit $450+ highs and that these positions will then be covered when shorts have driven the share price to a low price (this would make sense because buying of GME was restricted) . If true that would mean those who are still holding are just bag holders right?

Volume

-A trend that moves on steady volume means that its likely to continue aka price is rising or price is lowering

-Falling volume means that a trend is likely to reverse, whether price is going up or down, it applies to both

-A burst of extremely high volume means that its trend is likely to reverse. Usually when the stock reaches its peak or when all of a sudden it crashes, keep your eye on the volume

-If there is Low volume and the price stays the same, it usually means thats this is the new normal price. People are unfazed by slight price changes here, this is the new normal

-A second price breakout after one just occured is usually marked by yet another high volume spike. It usually means losers are heading for the exit because theyve been bag holding and cant take the pain anymore or bulls are jumping back in

-a price breakout in low volume means that its fake, the price will recoil

-rising volume during a rally(after a stock crashed)means that even though the bagholders are leaving, new losers are coming in

-When volume shrinks during a rally, it means that bulls arent as eager to keep buying at these high prices. Fuel is being removed from this ship. A reversal is imminent 

-When volume dries up during a decline, it usually means a reversal. That is the bears are no longer shorting and the intelligent bulls who got out a long time ago are ready to pounce yet again

-As a rule of thumb, if todays volume is higher than yesterday‚Äôs, it means that a trend is likely to continue 

-Volume is relative, what is high for ibm may be low for apple. What is low for apple may be high for ibm

-As a rule of thumb, high volume is 25% higher than the avg volume of the past 2 weeks and low volume is 25% lower than the avg volume of the past 2 week

-High volume confirms new trends. If prices rise to a new peak, and volume reaches a new high, then prices are likely to retest, that is go below the peak and come back to the peak to see if it can exceed it or go back down.

-If a stock falls to a new low, and volume reaches a new high then that bottom will also retest- that is go up and come back down to that bottom to see if it goes even lower or stays there

-the true bottom of a stock occurs on low volume and is always retested at low volume. If it stays the same then this is a great buying opportunity 

-if volume shrinks during an upwards or downwards trend then that trend is ripe for a reversal 

-When a stock reaches a new peak than it was yesterday, but the volume is lower today than yesterday- this is a great shorting opportunity, that is: Now is the time to sell or time to buy puts

- This does not work on a downwards trend as a stock can keep going down even with low volume. It takes buying to move a stock up, but a stock can go down on its own weight

-Watch volume during a reaction against the upward trend(aka panic selling). If the dip continues but volume shrinks, it means bulls are no longer running or selling pressure is spent. When the explosion of selling volume dries up, then it means that the upwards trend will resume. This presents a good buying opportunity or to buy calls

-Many downtrends are punctuated(occurs at intervals) by rallies(price goes up momentarily)which begin on heavy volume. These shake out weak bears which causes volume to shrink and gives a signal to sell short~ this means that short sellers are now sure that the stock will crater because no more rallies

- I made it very clear that I do not speak for WSB and am a lowly lurker.

- I made sure to talk about the countless stories of folks using their GME tendies to donate to charity. I even brought up the donation posts and had them film them.

- I told them that I am an investor and am not forced to buy anything, make my own decisions, DFV doesn't dictate my investments, etc.

- I said ""I like the stock"" and discussed the promising upside I see with GME. Told them of all my fond childhood memories at Gamestock, etc.

- When asked how much money I invested, I told them, ""I can't say, my wife's boyfriend wouldn't be happy""

- I shared the gut drop feeling of how I felt when I woke up on Jan 28 and saw I was no longer able to buy.

- When asked, ""What do you think our interviewers should ask Vlad (yes, Vlad will be a part of this), I said: ""Ask him to be honest about liquidity"" and ""Try to dig deeper into the connections between Citadel, Melvin and RH""

- I said, ""For faith in a free market, one side of the market (retail) can never be locked out of trading while the other side (Hedgefunds) are free to trade."" Can't find the user who provided that talking point, but I thought it was solid. 

- I said ""Well respected analysts say the stock price could have ended up in the thousands if RH and other institutions didn‚Äôt limit/halt buying."" and ""This would have created the largest and fastest shift in wealth that the market has ever seen. There 10s of thousands of average retail traders who would have been millionaires if RH (and other brokers) didn‚Äôt cut off users ability to buy Gamestop stock""

- I said, ""It almost feels like an imaginary game where the rules are made up as it goes just to make sure the large institutions come out on top."" kudos to the user who provided that.

- I also spent quite a bit of time just takling about my person story, my recent brain tumor diagnosis, COVID induced pay cuts at work, my non-profit, etc.

**Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 ‚Äì 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it‚Äôs actually big but it‚Äôs GME we‚Äôre talking about so I‚Äôm speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that‚Äôs when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week‚Äôs price action (and potentially next week‚Äôs) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.

Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don‚Äôt know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.

It‚Äôs also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren‚Äôt obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that‚Äôs why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.

**Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it‚Äôs because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.

Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it‚Äôs 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don‚Äôt learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that‚Äôll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.

Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.

**RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they‚Äôre gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would‚Äôve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn‚Äôt halt buying, so don‚Äôt underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!

**Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don‚Äôt get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn‚Äôt cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don‚Äôt update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.

**How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.

**Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I‚Äôve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I‚Äôm gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there‚Äôs a catalyst especially at the end of each month.

**The Point**: The point of this is that IT‚ÄôS NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it‚Äôs very short: [https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)

The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it‚Äôs that wall street doesn‚Äôt learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won‚Äôt sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.

STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE‚ÄôS BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I‚Äôm just a dude with a small penis)

**EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it‚Äôs over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say ‚ÄúHF won‚Äôt fuck up again they learned from their mistakes‚Äù .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.

Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.

Broviet,0.0,2915.0," 

Time for another little psychology discussion, y'all! As per usual, you won't find many numbers from me here, even though this situation involves a staggering amount of them. I think that most people holding now believe deeply in this trade and understand the DD, but some may still be confused about how this could have happened. How it could be allowed to happen.

Any of you that have read my prior content know that there is no love lost between me and the hedge funds, and most of the financial services industry as a whole. But as much as I harp on the fact that their profits are nowhere near commensurate with their expertise, I must admit, they are competent at what they do. At the very least, they have experience, they have staggering amounts of money, they have the complicity from other organizations/gov/SEC, and they have disinformation/lawyers/PR at their disposal. A lot of things you, we, do not. So how could this have happened?

In short? Technology, and their inability to keep pace with it in all but a couple aspects.

While they were laying fiber between Chicago and NYC to make sure they were always the front-runner in day-trading and short-term pumps, the burgeoning internet was teaching you about diversification, index funds, and why you shouldn't try to fight them on their terms. While your parents were fighting tooth and nail trying to provide for you after 2008, the internet was teaching you why it happened, how they did it, and how the wool was pulled over the world's eyes. While they were hiring a couple software engineers to design algorithms to think for them and buying up political and media support to ensure they could take any action they want with no repercussions, no matter how irresponsible, you were learning about the power of decentralized networks, crowdsourcing, and big data.

I recently had a lengthy discussion with a younger friend of mine who asked me to mentor him as he pursued his MBA/MS in Quantitative Economics. One of his professors had said something that he'd noticed me alluding to in the past, but I had never put into words so succinctly: if not for the Nobel Prize, Paul Krugman seems like an idiot. During my time in grad school, I'd noticed the same thing. This supposed paragon of Economics, that we have heaped praise and awards on for decades for his analysis of markets, has changed his core views on market fundamentals no less than twice during his career. Why?

Well, it's not really his fault, as much as I'd like it to be (the smug bastard). Many of you might be familiar with the phrase ""A person is smart. People are dumb."" This is the ultimate oxymoron. It speaks to the tendency for people to act irrationally when influenced as a group on a large scale. How individual logic, rationality, and DUE DILIGENCE break down when one is influenced or pressured by those around them. Undeniably true. But if that is the case, then what explains apes holding strong together? What explains how we found, examined, and analyzed this together to gain enough confidence to ignore mainstream media, our friends and family, and social convention to dive into this trade headlong and hold on for dear life?

Unfortunately, I can't link the youtube video directly, but go look up ""Moneyball first guy through the wall on YT. And if you havent seen that movie, go watch it immediately.

DFV is to be commended as the first guy through the wall. He knew going into this that there was a danger of blowback when the powers that be scrambled to point the finger at someone, and he shouldered it willingly. But as they and all of you came to realize, there is no target. DFV is an ape extraordinaire, to be sure, but he is but one of millions. There is no central authority. There is no cabal or collusion. There is no manipulation of a situation that unfairly tips odds in our favor. There is just fact. There is just supply and demand. We just like the stock.

This is working because DFV's analysis was built on sound fundamentals. It was built on how the market is SUPPOSED to work. It just so happened that a squeeze was a possibility. One that wouldn't happen if the company's fundamentals didn't warrant it. Then hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life took time they didn't have out of their busy days to dig into every single detail to confirm, re-confirm, re-re-confirm, re-re-retar...-confirm, and confirm again, until the due diligence became ironclad. Each wrench that the hedges threw into the cogs was able to be monitored, unpacked, and dismissed in real time, only strengthening your resolve. That you are RIGHT. That THIS is wrong. That YOU are the ones behaving rationally and responsibly. And you are able to look around you and see not a faceless mob of irrational humanity, but beautiful, kind, intelligent apes that are holding strong right along with you. Because you KNOW they know what you know. You know they like the stock.

My young economist friend went on to tell me, with great despair, that he no longer had faith in Krugman, or any individual economist. That he was losing faith in himself. How could he trust his own analysis, knowing that he's just as fallible and susceptible to outside influence or lack of information as any other single human? I told him then what you've displayed now. That I don't want one ""genius"" economist. I want a hundred people with a solid knowledge of market mechanics. I want a thousand. I want a hundred thousand. And I want a general consensus from their combined due diligence. More often than not, that consensus will be right. Eliminate the bias. Inspect from every angle. Share between one another. And aspire to maximum transparency.

Welcome to big data. Welcome to crowdsourcing. Welcome to decentralization.

YOU, my friends, are the future.

TLDR: The first ones through the wall always get bloodied. Always. But you are right. And you will win. And you will change history. I am so very proud, and truly love you all. Stay strong, you magnificent apes, and I'll see you on Alpha Centauri.

I may have eaten too many yellow crayons I thought were bananas this week (Or was I trying to eat yellow crayons but ate bananas? Idr) but I think I stumbled onto something.

Most people on this sub are Millenials (speculation). Most Millenials grew up playing video games. We have a passion for them. But we never really picked up a lot of practical skills from playing video games. *Until now*.

As we all know, Robinhood and similar apps **game-ified** investing. They made cool colors to show us how we did. It's not enough to show green and red on the app so the entire fucking screen has to be colored so we know what the fuck is going on. So we could say ""Ohhhh green good red bad."" It's like the slot machine except, unlike slots, investing odds can be changed by doing work. Nobody used to do the work, but now that all the work is on the phone--the same device we have been using to play the game--it still feels like part of the game. 

So we do some research and now we actually have a leg up in the game. It's like when you play StarCraft and you suck but then you read an article on how to not suck at StarCraft. Well, we read posts on GME and we sucked less at predicting the movement on that stock. 

Why are video games even fun? None of it is real. But it's a **shared** experience that you can have with your friends and peers, or, at the very least, discuss with them. It's the consensus that something cool happened on a screen that makes games fun on a social level, even though it's all fake. Well none of the money movements we see on the screen are real. Sure, it's all documented, but it's still virtual. Nobody's going to your bank and moving cash into RH's bank. This all works because we all agree that it works.

Now get a bunch of apes to play the game after reading the rules and even, for some of us, practicing, and you've got the beginning of a movement to a new era of trading and investing.

I know many of you are more like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k77i69/wsb_reading_citron_reports/) if it comes to reading DDs. But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.

# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain ü¶ç)

There are two types of squezzes:

* short squezze
* gamma squezze

**Short squezzes:**

Evil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --&gt; Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9v5e9/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am/).

**Gamma squezzes:**

Evil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.

If you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.

What you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.

# Applying this to the current GME situation

**Short squezze:**

Im sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).

^(1: 01/14/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

^(2: 02/11/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

*""But there was no volume?"".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.

^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)

^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN)

*""But what is with the institutional ownership?""* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said ""Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest."" (e. g. see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.

^(5:) [^(Finra)](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)

With that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.

^(6:) [^(Etf channel)](https://etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

**Gamma squezze:**

A gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.

*So how can ü¶çü¶çü¶ç profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.

^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)

*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lycj6f/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:

&gt;*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*

So these are probably numbers we need to see again.

^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)

*So whats the current situation with GME options?*

For the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.

^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)

&amp;#x200B;

[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03\/12](https://preview.redd.it/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967)

But for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.

I may be adding some more analysis thoughts later. But I will wait with that until I know people are actually reading this.

Today I've seen a whole new wave of people dropping pure misinformation and demonstrating an overall lack of understanding in the most basic of trading knowledge (people excited that calls expired ITM on a Monday... I'm looking at you). Instead of shunning these people away or. making them feel dumb, I wanted to take an abstract look at how this general idea could actually be a positive indicator.

I don't know shit about finance or anything along those lines, but I like looking at numbers. If you like numbers, this is for you. If you're looking for advice... I have none to offer at all.

So anyway... most people are in general agreement that the spike last week has covered by MM delta hedging. The price movement started right when the price hit $55:

https://preview.redd.it/pnhp2zkjeik61.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1308265360d3f9fea21087dd6c04df4e4f12fe7

Looking at the options chain last week (keep in mind, these numbers were taken right before close and will exclude any contracts exercised prior), there were a total of 18,610 contracts ITM at $55, or 1,861,000 shares. The volume in the proceeding 5 minutes jumped to over 4,000,000 shares.

The movement that lead up to closing saw the price touch $90. Looking at the open interest of contracts with strikes of $56 to $90, we have an additional 22,148 contract ITM (2,214,800 shares). The next candle following this trigger jumped to a volume of 18,000,000. Looking at the chart, this pattern continues with a larger-than-normal spike following each new milestone/strike price (until Friday, that is). Although a good portion of the volume was renewed hype and FOMO (with some institutional assistance al a Bruce's thesis), this is a steady pattern that indicates hedging of some degree on Wednesday and Thursday.

Now the fun part you smooth brains have been waiting for. Today, we saw similar action at $120 - once it held on the candle for a moment, there was an immediate spike to &gt;2m in volume. At $120, there are 29,960 contracts ITM (2.9m shares).

Looking at the data from last week and this week, we see that those spikes correlate directly to the number of ITM contracts, using 2/24 as an example:

https://preview.redd.it/47fops6seik61.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99e443a21e5f186dc6b2bc30e63d98b6e83ccd04

I'll admit, this is very speculative. Although it is data driven, the sample size is too small and my patience is too thin. But using these jumps as a point of reference... we may know where to expect algo driven volume...

To recap real quick, with today's close at $120 there are 29,960 weekly contracts ITM. You'll notice these spikes correlated with 3000+ jumps in ITM open interest, meaning we'd see a spike if we cross $125 heading to $130... **OH. WAIT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.**

Crossing this strike price directly corresponds with the jump in volume from 680k to 2.8m (again)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cspssj72fik61.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d1be76bb8607d752917c8ae8ec9129ce11cd461

**This means the next algo-driven hedging will happen on a small scale from $135-$145** (where there are an addition \~2000 contracts)... however, **THIS WILL PUSH IT TO $150**. At $150, there are another 4,000 contracts that would be ITM. Using the very smooth brained math from our table above, this would give us a 150-200% boost in volume as the $150's are hedged. Keep in mind, we'll already be at higher volume from the $140 run, so that moment will be something to behold.

**TL;DR** MY THEORY: Organically reaching new ITM strikes causes algo based hedging and an immediate spike in volume proportionate to the number of new ITM calls. Also, the domino theory is correct - based on hedging volume surrounding additional ITM options, breaking $140 should propel it to $150 which will be like dropping a match in a puddle of rocket fuel.

This isn't actual DD. Just my ADHD medication making me sexually attracted to numbers, and it helps when people watch.

Edit- spelling

Also i've been suffering with this bad boy as it has been oversold and shorted for the past month. Yes $RKT is absolutely mooning right now. Did you miss the RKT Rocket? Don't FOMO on the way back down to earth. Great news, theres another one on the tarmac ready for liftoff. It's name is $UWMC. $UWMC got a little bit of traction a month or so ago leading up to its earnings report after a massive SPAC deal. Guess what? It absolutely crushed its earnings. UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively.  This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do I hate? The shorts! 

Additionally, its a great income stock! UWMC declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021. Do you like free money? I would load up on this bad boy prior to March 10th! 

There are plenty of other catalysts and reasons to long this. It is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index by the end of this month, and it will absolutely crush its earnings again this quarter. Tomorrow, contracts will be pretty expensive as IV will go thru the roof in the AM, but as of market close there were still very reasonable prices for March, April, and May (post earnings) calls.  

Look at this activity aftermarket, it is up $1.30 (\~15%)! I wouldn‚Äôt wanna be staring from the sidelines as this stock rockets like $RKT? 

\*Disclaimer\* I am Long UWMC and have calls for both April and May.  This is not financial advice I just like the stock!!

*editing to add this dumb ass pun I thought of way too late: I‚Äôd MORTGAGE the house on this one.

*editing again bc I forgot to include the ANALysts PTs if you care about those; average is $11.60, low of $10.50, and high of $13.50. All are bulls.

*edit x3 since I‚Äôm a smooth brain and didn‚Äôt include what UWMC actually does and this has gotten much more attention than I thought. UWMC is United Wholesale Mortgage Corporation! They are... as the name implies... a mortgage lender! They mainly fund mortgage loans through independent mortgage brokers. Aka they make bank off of interest... think about how much you smooth brains pay in interest and will pay in interest every month for the next 25 years of your life. You‚Äôre paying UWMC. They‚Äôve got a decent chunk of the market, and are continuing to grow.

*edit x4 for all of you smooth brains that set stop losses and/or freak out when it dips at open on a red day... what do you think the institutions are doing when they see a bunch of dorks on WSB loading up on a new stock? They‚Äôre gonna short it to smithereens bc they know how many paper hands are here https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc (there were 1,000,000 available at close yesterday and we‚Äôre at 80,000 available currently 12:30 3/3.)

Update: only 35k shares available to short as of 1PM and this baby is holding $10+. With the volume of calls for 3/19 today, this could go parabolic on 3/19 if it keeps steady.

mt4h,0.0,2656.0,"When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

This isn't some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing. ""paper hands"" are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags. Now depending on the situation, they might not leave bags, and people with diamond hands make more money. Sometimes, paper hands are right. 

That is because... drum roll... it's all about supply and demand. This is especially true in options, because they are zero-sum. That means someone will come out a loser. This idea that if we all hOLd tHE LiNE then the stock will keep going up is simply untrue. This isn't your modern dodge-ball where everyone comes out with participation trophies.

Fragsworth,0.0,2624.0,"Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.

I'm just here to tell you the story.

This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)

Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.

Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:

* Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume.
* U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE)
* Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post)
* Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved.
* Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?)
* 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5

**= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""

Important points:

1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue.
2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks.
3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018)
4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...

It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.

**Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**

Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.

YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political

andrestg99,0.0,2739.0," Ok listen up fuckbags, I spent some time in the weekend sniffing the green crayons I found and chewed the black ones. But I also did some research on what to do when you get a huge influx of money like you retarded ape are about to get when you sell each share for 500k.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to state that fuck you Kenny G, and that the SEC can suck my trail mix. But I am not a financial advisor and you should not listen to me. We are not a group, and there is no we. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, I would like to address why you should miss the peak and sell on the way down. If you ape sell a share before the peak, you limit your upside of selling that share at a higher price AND you limit how high the peak can go, by adding liquidity to the market you help shorts leave their positions for a bargain and at the same time you screw other apes by limiting how high the peak can go. If you wait out and sell AFTER the peak, you allow the price to go its full way and you alongside other apes can sell their shares for a higher price even if you don‚Äôt sell at the peak I believe it is better to hold, miss the 1M per share peak and start selling at 700k instead of selling at 100k missing a possible 600k profit PER SHARE. But that is just me, do whatever the fuck you want. I don‚Äôt give a fuck. Again I remind you this shouldn¬¥t be considered a coordinated sell because well, it is illegal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, once you stupid uneducated ape gets a hand on millions and for some even billions of dollars, you are going to have to start growing wrinkles in that brain of yours because if you don¬¥t the money will leave your hands just as fast as it came and the world will not become a better place turning the greatest transfer of wealth in human history to a massive lotto winner curse that just bankrupts us.

&amp;#x200B;

You should spend some time at least watching YouTube videos and figure out what to do with those humongous amounts of money. I will leave you some tips I found in my research.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do not tell anyone

&amp;#x200B;

Keep it to yourself, process it, don‚Äôt go around telling people you are rich, you will only put yourself at risk or just compromise yourself to fake friends or people asking you for money.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Get financial advice (real one)

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth going to a credible institution and get help from them, you should get a lawyer, accountant, and a team to help you and assist you with all the problems and difficulties that moving, investing, and spending all that money come with. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Pay your taxes

&amp;#x200B;

Save some money for taxes, advisors help with this but make sure your money is clean and free of any legal or federal compromise so you can use it freely without having to hide or risk going to jail for any funny business. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Pay off your debt

&amp;#x200B;

Liquidate your credit card, your mortgage if it has a high-interest rate, and any other debt you are in, learn how to use debt to your advantage in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Hold the money for at least 6 months in your bank account

&amp;#x200B;

You will have all kinds of crazy ideas of what you will be able to do with the money, let those ideas settle and mature, by not touching the money for some time you will filter out the crazy stupid ideas and keep the valuable ones, be smart and make a plan on how and what to spend the money on.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Don‚Äôt quit your job (yet)

&amp;#x200B;

We are humans and we need productivity, I don‚Äôt mean to keep your 9-5 job forever, but a huge amount of change in a small period of time will make you lose your ground. Start making a plan from today and make the changes bit by bit, let some time pass, make sure you are going in the right direction and you are doing what you want, and what is best for you. I will probably dedicate myself to start a foundation and maybe some businesses but make a plan, start slow and make the changes over time after a good amount of thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

7. Invest in yourself, get healthy

&amp;#x200B;

Learn, grow, become wealthy in your head, change your mindset, learn how money works and how to use it, this will allow you to grow your money further, and most importantly, stay wealthy. Learn all of this so you don‚Äôt get scammed or stolen from excessive fees in the financial business. Also, work out and stay healthy, I want you to enjoy your money for a long long time.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Do not invest in friends businesses or start a business alone right away

&amp;#x200B;

It is a tempting idea but doesn‚Äôt go around giving money or investing in any idea your friends have, stay smart, and go little by little, learn about how business works, and don‚Äôt spend a huge amount of money investing or starting a business by yourself, read the book ‚ÄúLean Startup‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

9. Prepare for change

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, everything, from friends to lifestyle, to wellbeing, to opportunities but also prepare to be the target of greedy or evil people who will want to take money off you.

&amp;#x200B;

10. 5% rule

&amp;#x200B;

Read about it, but basically, you live off what your money produces, you don‚Äôt live off your tendies directly instead you live off what your tendies produce.

&amp;#x200B;

11. Play it safe

&amp;#x200B;

You are already rich, don‚Äôt risk it buying weekly tesla calls. Don‚Äôt be stupid, stay rich and use your money to grow your wealth, to improve your own life, your family¬¥s life, and the life of those around you. Start a foundation or become a Patreon of one but don‚Äôt donate huge amounts of money all at once, diversify, become a monthly contributor that way you can learn about the real needs of each nonprofit and you can help more of them.

boostedCLowNs,0.0,2560.0,"First of all, sorry for my German potato English. I am relatively new to this retarded sub, started lurking in it around December 2020 I think, because that was when I started ""investing"". 

That's also why I don't want to talk about the trading/financial aspects of this whole meme stock situation, but want to take a look at the general behavior and use of language the past two months.

After deeply following the discussions about the effects of fake news, filter bubbles, the radicalization of individuals through social media and the laws and regulations regarding these topics in the past years (including research on these topics for an essay I wrote as a law student, which I still am), there are certain key words or phrases that have been established in the discussions and DDs regarding GME etc. that either make me really angry, frustrated or irritated. In the past couple of weeks, I had these thoughts swirling around, and wanted to share them:

\- I know confirmation bias is strong in all of us, me included, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't allow and discredit different opinions. A civilized discussion, where every argument/fact backed standpoint is heared and respected, is what brings the best results and answers, regardless the topic. 

\- ""CNBC FAKE NEWS"", ""THE MEDIA IS BOUGHT BY HFs"" etc. I totally see where these claims are coming from (the strange amount of articles regarding SLV etc.), but endlessly repeating these phrases has not a single positive effect. In my opinion, these phrases aren't apolitical at all, and hence shouldn't even be allowed in this sub. I'll explain why: Not only in the US, but also in Germany, these phrases, portraying established media outlets as ""fake"", ""controlled by XY"", ""biased towards left/right"", are predominantly used by populist groups and people with tendencies towards the conspiracy scene. Based on this, I can't read these phrases in a non political way, especially with all the discussions of the past years in mind. That's why I find it irritating to read these phrases over and over again not only in the daily discussion and GME threads, but also in popular posts on the hot page of wsb. 

\- In addition to the previous point, I'd like to introduce you to the concept of ambiguity (in-)tolerance.  

""Intolerance of ambiguity may be defined as ‚Äòthe tendency to perceive (i.e. interpret) ambiguous situations as sources of threat‚Äô; tolerance of ambiguity as ‚Äòthe tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable"" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_tolerance‚Äìintolerance)

 A phenomenon of social media ""discussions"" nowadays is the find, that many people are lacking the ability to accept different opinions and to accept the fact, that an event or a fact, (e.g. GME stock price, short %) may have more than one possible reason or explanation, especially if you prefer on of the reasons over the others. 

Regarding our situation, this often leads to people down voting, hating on and even threatening users who try to show different possible perspectives on the events surrounding the GME craze instead of having an open discussion and being thankful for a broader look on the situation. 

\- ""short ladder attacks"" This term, which was used more and more often during the first weeks of February after GME hit its high, resurfaced in the past couple of days in many threads and posts, even though we had many very solid DDs on why this term and concept is wrong and shouldn't be used. I don't know why, but I can't read any post with that term in it without a strange feeling in my guts, regardless of the overall quality of the post. 

Some additional points:

\- Since GME settled at around 40$, we had a new trending post setting a fixed event or date as the ""MOON TIME"" almost every day. and correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I remember not a single one of these theories became true. Most of the time it even felt like it had the opposite effect of letting the stock price drop once reaching the predicted date. That's why I stopped trusting these kinds of posts and hyping myself up for then being let down once again. The next ""big date"" is the 19th of March, with many people hoping for that to be the rocket launch. And as much as I too wish for it to be true, I really don't think we should continue to name fixed dates for a liftoff. 

Regarding that you always have to remember, that everything written here can be and most probably is read by not only us little idiot sandwiches, but by every single HF social media guy, every journalist and every other person who feels the need to waste some time on here. 

My conclusion is, that every hype that arises, also attracts people who bet on the bursting of it.

\- That leads to another point I want to make: not every chart action that happens is an evil strategy of a Bond villain like HF Manager. As I understand, it is a long known and ""popular"" strategy to invert the trending stock actions (buys/sells) of WSB users for profit. So keep in mind that every post with for example a solid theory for the next liftoff of GME or a DD for a stock that reaches the hot page, attracts many users who try to bet against it, which is completely normal. After all we are a bunch of individuals. In the end of the day everyone has his own profit in mind, and not a collective greater good. And that's not a bad thing, but the inner core of this sub, which made it what it is today. 

So all in all, think about what you read, try to understand different perspectives, engage in meaningful discussions, ask questions, and don't spend too much time on here. The squezoozle happens when it does, or maybe it won't, who knows, let the time show it.

&amp;#x200B;

Be nice to each other, have a wonderful day and fuck you.

Variation-Separate,0.0,2546.0,"**OSTK is undervalued**. At first glance, one may wonder does a stock with a &gt;4000% run from its 52-week low and up 54% YTD have room to grow?

**Point 1:** There has not been broader market interest in this stock in over a year. Put simply, demand for shares as examined through volume traded at 1D, 1M, 1 quarter, as well as 1 year averages is at a low.

[Fig 1 - OSTK overview](https://preview.redd.it/4fwgbra2lih61.png?width=1222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00f85d806f01c47f65ad010a3981b60ee7bf68ce)

**Point 2:** OSTK trades at a significant discount relative to its competitor W which currently trades 2x sales and OSTK trades 1.1x sales. The best market comparison to OSTK at the moment is Wayfair (W).

[Fig 2 - OSTK and W relative comparisons](https://preview.redd.it/n0vk6gc5lih61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28eca64e8d10be029dce04ef5fee1581a9c9225)

**Point 3:** Institutional ownership of OSTK is growing. 1 month ago, institutional changes in ownership of OSTK increased dramatically by 40% through large tutes such as Morgan Stanley, Allianz SE, Blackrock, and Vanguard as well. In fact, Blackrock was against OSTK's direction towards digital blockchain technology last year. [https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf)

Last week, Allianz SE increased it's stake to 7.5%.

[Fig 3 - Bloomie institutional data](https://preview.redd.it/68kml1a8lih61.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f684e7ee5daa2ebb826024e1e9d96aa022d004)

**Point 4:** OSTK has short interest of over 10%. With 42.77 million shares outstanding, and a 40 million share float, latest NASDAQ filing data still show that over 4.374 million shares are currently held short. While that may seem relatively small, naked short selling is still occurring with 16 SEC fail-to-delivers during January occurring on OSTK.

Legendary short trader Marc Cohodes is long on this name and I learned about this stock from his posts on Twitter.

**Point 5:** OSTK through tZERO addresses an emerging need of broker-dealer issues (\*cough\* Robinhood \*cough\*) and transparency at the right time. Briefly, tZero is an alternative trading system **regulated** by the SEC that will enable people to invest in **any** asset using a tokenized system with the goal of ending settlement times. Think of a one stop shop for c$rypto, tokenized securities, and stocks.

Current assets include OSTKO, tZEROp, ASPD. With the acquisition of Bitt: B/T/C, E/T/H, L/T/C, and RVN are now tradeable. The current roadmap is to have traditional securities such as stocks traded on the platform by Q4 2021.

[Fig 5 - tZERO trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/b4jyb74elih61.png?width=3284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9af5bbe4794c9067dd22fb60792bf942598d8d9)

[Fig 6 - tZERO $ nominal trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/swgb2o1hlih61.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f12882ff8c6c34e6d12df252871cc6f0a6f94a)

**Point 5:** OSTK holds a 90% stake in tZERO. tZERO is nascent. With only $53 million traded in digital token securities, this is small to other markets and exchanges. However, this represents a 10x fold increase from 2019 to 2020.

Numbers on the actual c$ryptocurrency volumes and $ volume traded are less clear. The latest information revealed a 32x increase in $ volume year-to-year traded.

Coinbase had $923 million in revenue in 2017 with a trading volume of 41 billion. In 2020, it had a revenue of $2.3 billion with a valuation of $75 billion. Coinbase does not offer trading other tokenized securities nor does it offer trading of traditional securities like stocks.

Napkin math: simply assume that tZERO has 1/30th the revenue across all securities ($53 million in digital tokens + $13 million in c$rypto = $67 million), this implies tZero has a valuation of $2.5 billion when compared to Coinbase. Once the valuations of these two companies becomes more clear, OSTK valuation will reach closer to its true value.

[Fig 7 - Coinbase revenue](https://preview.redd.it/vxnyrjzllih61.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3d11ee7aa6852ff0f4826b829376028a61b6fa)

DYOR. Know your risk. Size appropriately. Manage your own trade.

Important areas to watch next 130, 172, 256, 394, 482, 512.

**tl;dr Fundamental dislocation and valuation of OSTK is leading to a large mispricing event where the market cannot effectively evaluate OSTK's true value.**

On a simple relative valuation, OSTK at parity to W should trade at 200/share given same P/S ratios. Once the valuation of tZERO is more properly priced in to OSTK, tZERO in and of itself could be closer to the same valuation of OSTK. This does not include future performance, multiples, or other blockchain businesses such as Voatz that OSTK has a stake in.

Q4 earnings 2/24/21.

Potential headwinds: Execution by management of their timeline for tZERO's rollout. Failure to get FINRA approval for stocks. G20 simultaneous regulation of c$ryptocurrencies. Slowing down of the economy and appetite for risk assets such as c$ryptocurrenices in 2H 2021.

*********************** 
**RECAP**

Breif history of CRSR, the stock blew up post IPO from $17, riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic.  It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36. The float is low so swings are volatile. Also lots of short volume bla bla

**1/13** - a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum. Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze (maybe retail and/or institutional....Citadel is 2% owner of CRSR float)... or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters, who knows?

Cool, so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap. It starts climbing back to the average peak levels, then ...

**1/27** - CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7.5 million shares...it hits a high of $49, before a 2 day selloff.  Crash Boogaloo.

After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report, with expectations of excellent numbers. IV is through the roof. Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable.

**2/9**  -  **CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report.** EPS beats estimates, $1.7B revenue for the year, profit margins way up, debt is down, and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT. The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages (which every other tech company is dealing with too).

 After this amazing ER, the stock tops out at about $48 premarket....before nosediving, nearly hitting $40. 

Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype, so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest. 

But looking at what actually happned, it wasn't actually just hype. The pre-ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs.  The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021, so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush...sell limits were triggered, self-fulfilling prophecy.   

So the price starts to fall into oversold territory. Quote from Barron's ""Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy, and one has a Hold rating on the name."" Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull. Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9

But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to ""Neutral"" from ""Buy"", causing the selloff to dip even lower, hitting just above $40. Their justification? They think gaming demand could wane in 2021, and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100% of demand due to shortages of chimps. (ha!)

**************************************************************************
**CURRENT SITUATION**

That brings us to today. CRSR is way oversold. $1.7B profitable revenue...yet $3.9B market cap for a fast-growth tech company? pitiful. Almost every analyst, including Goldman, has increased their price targets, many above $50. 

Compare that to LOGI..$2.9B revenue ($4.4B+ TTM), at $19.9B market cap and climbing fast.  Speaking of LOGI, check out this [chart](https://imgur.com/3ORH329). **1/19 Post-Earnings dip, before running to ATH 2 weeks later.** 

But CRSR price is still down, why my neuro-atypical friends?

Maybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50% every day? http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html 

Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back (we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon.)

But pressure is easing, as of 1/29, short interest dropped 44% from the previous report. And daily short volume dipped below 50% yesterday for the first time in months (this isn't a squeeze play, this means that short downward pressure is backing off).  IVs starting to return to earth.

And what also happened today? The P OTUS just [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority. Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand, and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade.  

The gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases. We all know new players get hooked, and there are tens of millions of them since last year. The more they game the more they‚Äôll be looking to buy new gear. They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more. 

They also currently have a big stake in the streaming market, which 1000% isn't going away

Without the shortages, there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential. 

With the rest of the rockstar fundamentals, this is a $65-$70 stock EASY. You will not beat this entry point. 

Very minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least.

If you haven't already, you should read it.

Linked here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)

Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and before RKT got the earnings boost, valued at MORE than üöÄüöÄüöÄ, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's another little DD summary I found:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx\_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit)

&amp;#x200B;

If you were too lazy to read either of those, know that RKT has 40% short interest. 40 PERCENT. THE SHORT BORROWING FEE IS 80%

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT](https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT)

&amp;#x200B;

This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by Friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

YES. YOU READ THAT RIGHT. üö®üö® 5 DAYS UNTIL THEY HAVE TO COVER OR COUGH UP THE DIVIDEND

üö®üö® THIS IS NOT A DRILL. WE HAVE AN ACTUAL SHORT EXPIRATION DATE üö®üö®

&amp;#x200B;

To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.

This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's also targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.

I'd link the interview, but reddit won't let me for a DD post.

TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY üö®FRIDAYüö® and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK. Retail/WSB buying pressure on RKT would üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ it to the ABSOLUTE üåïüåïüåï.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally imagine an epic runup until Friday, which could then also pop a gamma squeeze while we're at it.

&amp;#x200B;

The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.

Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 109, $35 C 1/21/2022 x5.

EDIT: If you're confused about why 3/5 when the ex-dividend date is 3/9, here is a source to my claim that because of T+2 settlement you must own by Friday.

Ex-Dividend Date

One factor complicating the discussion of the dividend date is settlement. When you purchase a stock, it takes three business days for ownership to be transferred. This transfer of ownership is referred to as settlement. Therefore, you have to purchase the stock at least three business days before the record date to receive a dividend. Assume the record date is June 4. If you buy the stock on June 1, you will own it on June 4 and be entitled to receive a dividend. However, if you buy it on Tuesday or later, ownership transfer will occur after the record date and you will not be paid a dividend. June 2 is therefore referred to as the ex-dividend date; in other words, the first day on which buyers will no longer be entitled to a dividend.",wallstreetbets,The üöÄüöÄ$RKT is fueled and ready for liftoff! üìàüìà üö®üö®LAUNCHES TOMORROW üö®üö®,2479.0,0.88

The purpose of this post is exploring options and the effect they will have on GME stock. This will not be exploring lack of liquidity, short interest, or fundamentals. 

I went through every call option chain and manually counted volume. So all the numbers I use will be rough estimates and expect a margin of error. 

To sum up the data there is 65k call options expiring this Friday,that likely will not be relevant unless we see massive price jumps today and early tomorrow.  There is 265 in all the other strikes put together. This is 330k volume in total which is absolutely massive. There is volume 65k concentrated in the 800 strikes. 10k of this is for Friday and the other 55k is all the other expirations.(bear in mind I have not factored in puts volume as well, which will have negative effects)

The two scenarios I will present rest on the fact that the squeeze reaches 850 and delta is roughly 100 making dealers need to hedge 100%. Once it reaches this point shit will start to heat up and price movements will be even more volatile. 

Scenario 1 
Cohen tweets a picture of a rocket ship, price increases 4x in AH and trading tomorrow. This would put price at about 800, dealers become fully hedged and need to have 330 * 1000 * 100 = 33,000,000 million shares by this point. This is more than the entire float. They likely already hold 10mil plus, but in this event they would still need to buy  more 23,000,000 shares. 

Scenario 2
It takes another week for price to rise to the 800 level. All the options from last week expire. This still leaves 265k  means that 26,500,000 still need to be hedged. This event is more likely and has a decent chance of happening has along as we get another catalyst. 

What does this mean for smooth brained retards? Im sure the autist already see where this is going. The simple version is if we reach 800 we will soar right past 1k and trading will become extremely violent. Price targets of 1k are laughable because if we reach 1k we are going right past it.

*^(You'll need to enable macro, needed to run Black Scholes functions, I promise no virii inside)*

So based on  the market close data of 3/3/21, using options data up to the 3/19 expiry, the net delta hedged shares by MMs stands at 6,852,559 \*(\*\*^(If we assume most MMs try to be delta neutral)\*). And if $GME price were  to increase to 200$, they would need to buy an additional 6,261,580 shares

Now suppose you want to see what happens when someone buy 20,000 of 3/12 200 calls. Go the EXPIRY2\_CALLS sheet and edit the Open Interest of the options

check back at the cover sheet, the net buy needed by MMs,

is now 6,825,991 vs 6,261,580 previously, an increase of 564,411 shares. So a call option worth 20,000 x 5.2 x 100 = 10,400,000$, if the stock price increased from 124.8 to 200 (in 1 day) would have triggered an added 564,411 shares delta hedged (rough approximation), which was worth 564,411 x 124.8 = 70,438,492$ if bought outright, giving an amplification factor of roughly 7:1.(^(not using tick data to forecast price increase vs buying volume)) One common misconception is that if a call becomes ITM near expiry, MMs would have already bought &gt;90% of it in delta hedge, however  for a high IV like $GME, its closer to 60%.

# The Posting (my comments added in parentheses)

**About Cindicator Capital**

Launched in 2019, Cindicator Capital is the first quantitative fund powered by Hybrid Intelligence ***(makes you wonder how long it took to come up with that name)***. The fund's set of uncorrelated strategies adapts to different regimes in the digital asset market, aiming to generate returns in bullish, bearish, and sideways trends.

Last year, we‚Äôve built Macro Sentiment Indicators, a tool that tracks the moods of market participants to predict weekly movements of the S&amp;P 500 and other instruments with 70% accuracy ***(So, they've predicted the market with 70% accuracy since 2019... I can do better than that:  Stonks only go up.   That is more accurate than 70% since 2019)***. Now we‚Äôre looking for someone to strengthen our trading team and help us build new products.¬†

**About this role**¬†

As a Sentiment Trader, you‚Äôll be the voice of the millions of traders. With a combination of our qualitative approach to measuring market moods and your ‚Äòstreet-smarts‚Äô, you‚Äôll actively manage our internal multi-million corporate treasury **(so, this job will last you two weeks)**. Then you‚Äôll turn the resulting insights into new features, products, and trading strategies for clients.¬†

**What you should have:**¬†

* 3+ years of active trading experience with both impressive gains and losses; **(we only do one or the other here)**
* In-depth knowledge of options greeks and indicators; **(this means that they are a constant frat party)**
* A solid grasp of probability even if you don‚Äôt know the theory (i.e. be good at poker); **(they were so proud of themselves for this line)**
* An active member of r/wallstreetbets with an account age of &gt;365 days and karma of over 1000; **(no prayer threads.   They don't need to take your energy.   They just want FD's.)**
* Clear, unbiased thinking that defies authority;  **(Don't worry about the first part.   Defying authority.   Check.)**
* A refined taste for memes and a sense of humour.  **(The fellow kids meme was made for this one)**

&amp;#x200B;

Important: NO higher education in economics or finance. Alternatively, prove that you‚Äôre free from any mainstream financial brainwash.¬†  **(Numbers are meaningless in this market.   We agree.)**

**What you will be doing:**¬†

* Combining our proprietary Macro Sentiment Indicators with your own research to formulate trading ideas for quant strategies;¬† **(Don't tell these guys about our secret method of using chickens)**
* Spending most of your time on Reddit, Discord chats, and Twitter to feel the pulse of the tens of millions of retail traders;¬† **(Not sure how this is going to be different)**
* Opening six-figures OTM options trades with the firm‚Äôs own capital;¬† **(THIS we can do.  WAY OTM.)**
* Trying your best to prevent our risk management from having a heart attack.¬† **(Good thing they get subsidized medications too)**

**Benefits:**¬†

* $200,000 base salary and a performance-based bonus (30% of the P&amp;L);

* Medical and dental insurance;

KitrosReddit,0.0,2340.0,"After my last DD about how if we hit $800 today we would trigger the MOASS, there seems to be a lot of misinformation floating around illustrating this idea that if GameStop did *not* hit 800 today that it's over.

This is not the case in the slightest, and my only guess is a mix of shills/bots and worried newbies are spreading these comments.

*If it hits 800 any week it will trigger a massive gamma squeeze, but each week sooner it does it the greater the gamma squeeze will be. If it doesn't hit 800 today, it's not a big deal.*

What matters in gamma squeezes is the *number of contracts,* come next week there might be more contracts than this week anyway, there's literally nothing to worry about.

Hitting 800 in 2 days was very unlikely from the beginning, however, *if* it had happened it would have triggered the greatest gamma squeeze of all time, that's what made the 2/26 date so exciting. However, we still closed above $100, so that means that all the contracts from 40-100 this week are now ITM, which means we will most likely see a nice gamma squeeze next week. It's simply business as usual folks.

*If it hits 800* ***at any point***\*, we will still see a massive gamma squeeze as all the contracts will be in the money.\* There is no date restriction on this, 2/26 was just kinda insane because we had the potential to go from 40 to 800 in a span of 2 days, which would have been fucking bonkers.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, ""meme stocks"" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.

I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform)

Here we see, ""[BlackBerry Limited](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX¬Æ Neutrino¬Æ Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).""

For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.

As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform)

I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.

The tits pattern is shaping up nicely.

Using nerds lingo, it could be a double cup and handle and not just a double bottom as previously suggested.

For the pattern to be confirmed, we shouldn't have any drops below $49. A strong rejection around $57 would form the handle.

- Tops and bottoms

Yeah they give us false hopes and show us the mid 50s just to push us back down on low volume duh.

But guys, we're making higher lows. That's big.

They were able to push as low as $46 (first tit in the tits pattern), then as low as $48 (2nd tit bottom), then $49 for a brief moment during power hour.

Making higher lows and claiming $49 as the new support would be massive. That's our short term goal.

Why? Because $44-$49 had been a massive resistance zone from July 2014 until November 2015. Then it dropped to oblivion.

- History repeating itself

It looks like we're losing, but we're not.

When GME was in the $10-$13 limbo in early November, the price action was eerily similar: pushed down intraday - even after strong bullish moves at open - because of the low volume.

Hopes crushed every day. But little did we know that we were making higher lows and a double cup and handle. Very similar to what's happening right now.

Don‚Äôt doubt your vibe. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**State of the DD afternoon 2/18**

Reee I‚Äôd feel more like shit if the indexes hadn‚Äôt been bleeding all week, and I‚Äôm glad I got a couple multibaggers off this week. Taken the massive profit on QS and CCL. Putting much of them in longer dated calls on the ones of these I believe in including JD FUBO and PLTR, M NIO XPEV and WKHS. CCL needs to rest. 

If FSLY goes down any further I won‚Äôt be able to discuss it because it‚Äôll be a penny stock üôÑ 

VXX highlights why I‚Äôm frustrated about this: theory was correct all the way around‚Äî treasury yield, sector rotation, etc. but the underlyings aren‚Äôt cooperating. Glad I picked further dates and recommended that as well. 

Still stand by the theory behind these just making them longer term if they‚Äôre shorter and averaging down. My leaps and shares are doing just fine in boomer oil. 

Stay strong. Stay long. Soon the bears will be gone. 

PS- we need a better way for swing traders to update. I can‚Äôt track when I enter and exit here affective it. 
 
****

**Update 2/18:** like the movement of the tech indices but sitting largely cash on my short swings now while those whole ‚Äòtaper tantrum‚Äô narrative figures itself out except for positions opened in $WKHS and JD near the bottom today. 

I don‚Äôt believe in buying puts and as such would rather wait it out than sell my soul

**R-E-L-A-X: 2/18 MORNING UPDATE**
**JD and WKHS getting high confidence flow. Agree or disagree, but reporting what I‚Äôm seeing. I am dip buying both 

We were prepared for this:

&gt;	**As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done‚Äîthis is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

This is why we went longer dated than usual, per intro instructions. Keep your VXX, feel out price movement this morning and cut anything risky short-dated. The CCL and QS war chest was mighty. Don‚Äôt just jump on sales, let the flow tell you what‚Äôs being bought. I‚Äôll scan and drop some tickers in the morning. 

Wealth has often been created on the back of 1DTE following a Thursday crash. 

*****

**State of the DD: 2/17 update 12:22 PM**

*please remember, these are WHALE plays. Follow the winners and cut the losers. High risk and high reward is what this is. If you are looking for the safe guaranteed growth stuff, grab some nice SPY leaps or something.*

Congrats to those who stayed with CCL and played the QS ER callout. Those tendies have staved off starvation for a night.  These are the reason we play. 

The PLTR rebound is indeed occurring with a boost from Cathie on CNBC as predicted. FUBO is also rebounding by strongly outperming the broader NASDAQ, and I expect continued performance with indices likely rebounding in the coming days. 

**FSLY calls are just absolutely fuk. Going to baghold some through ER as a Hail Mary.** Cant get much worse. Awful. I am ashamed. 

I am fine with the M price action for now. I am fine with VXX as it‚Äôs clearly needed rn. Trim a little each time it pops on VXX. 

I am holding off on that EV consideration for now except I opened a position in XPEV and NIO hoping post lunar new year buying will give us a little help in a beaten down industry. 2/26 ATM. TSLA has really turned it around today. 

Stay strong. Prayers up for the little homie FSLY üò≠ 

PS bought the WKHS dip 

**2/17 PRE MARKET UPDATE**

The latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. 

For the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. 

Hope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues. 

FUBO flying premarket

FSLY PLEASE FUCKING FLY

****

**The state of the DD: Update 1 2/16**

When these positions open big, please wait for dips FYI. I believe in the plays, but you need to choose entry points with common sense discretion. 

**Correct** on the sector rotation into DOW/cyclicals. M hit decently, CCL smashed and saved my portfolio today with +9%

**Incorrect**:IV wasn‚Äôt enough to save a very shit day from FSLY‚Äî the DAQ was a whipsaw today, though, so that didn‚Äôt help. 

**Incorrect but frustrating** FUBO got an announcement today that Comcast was buying a 9% investment stake, institutional money continued flowing in, yet it tanked. I guess the shorts are too strong. 
EDIT: monster AH movement from FUBO

**How I moved** trimmed FSLY and FUBO but clutching still, and opened a big position in PSTH in the morning still holding. Holding CCL and M too. I update when I‚Äôm moving on twitter, but I can‚Äôt post that info here so maybe I‚Äôll just update here at the end of each day and maybe in the morning.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Hi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week. **Shoutout to Unusual Whales who I‚Äôve spoken with and has given their blessing for me to provide these plays and screenshots. I recommend them bigly**

I monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim

I‚Äôve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I‚Äôm giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. 

Been on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.

*The whale plays I am interested in:*

[FSLY 2/26 110c](https://i.imgur.com/U00vNOa.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

I like this for two reasons.  **The first is simple**: I've seen repeat call flow into FSLY building up over the past two weeks, and it just can't sustain the pops yet.  It's a similar pattern I saw to the DKNG and NIO calls before their pops.  *Continued betting OTM by whales gives me more confidence with each slip, and pressure for an upward pop is building.*. **The second reason** is the dump after the NET ER.  I love when sympathy plays get oversold, because it's easy entry into their earnings run.  

**How I‚Äôm going to play it**: I'll follow the whale on a call spread up to 110 for 2/19, and ride it up until just before earnings Wednesday, then cut it.  Successful strategy I've been employing with tech earnings runs lately; last week I just closed my eyes and threw a dart at TWTR OTM calls and rode it up for about 100% the day of.  Sure, you miss out if earnings are a banger, but I have an increasingly strict no earnings rule.

**Earnins run= yes.  Holding through earnings= no**

[M 3/26 20c](https://i.imgur.com/ybj1GMB.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:

**1) The B of A BBBY upgrade**: [bulls are returning on BBBY now that the squeeze is over and their reasoning is strikingly similar to the M story](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-becomes-more-attractive-with-short-squeeze-over-b-of-a-says-11613076266).  Store closures?  Bullish.  Narrowly avoiding bankruptcy? Mega boolish.  But more importantly...
**2) Digital integration**: the CEO of M is actually a solid leader, and has really pushed the transition to digital and online merchandising.  I think this pivot will gain more spotlight headed into ER.

**How I‚Äôll play it**: M is a super streaky stock that can give you 8% return multiple days in a row, but can also frustratingly do the opposite.  It also tends to really crater in the mornings before stabilization and rising late in the day.  I will give this manic whale a chance on the 3/26c, while also clutching a more reasonable 16c 2/26 into the ER.  I will cut the 3/26 20c at the first sign of multi-day trouble

[VXX 4/1 20c ](https://i.imgur.com/kmKd8NC.jpg) üöÄ üò≠ 

I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and [here is a previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I did on how it works.  It is approaching absurd lows, fear and greed is rising, and all that other doomed shit you hear.  What really signals to me this is the time to expand this hedge is the potential for sector rotation (and the currently happening rotation).  **As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done--this is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

**How I‚Äôll play it:** a VXX 16c 2/26 feels right to purchase on a Tuesday dip meant)


[CCL 3/12 25.5](https://i.imgur.com/zfdoec7.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ 

Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.  *I understand and agree with the problems with travel right now: this is not an endorsement of the end of COVID, but I like the stock*, and I like the potential for upward movement.  I'll likely play this one as the whale has and exercise patience.  Has potential for wild swings, though, so keeping a close eye on this one.

**EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &amp;?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**üöó üöÄ 

Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.  **QS and FSR got lots of attention after upgrades and into QS earnings, but the titans are positioned to explode after some from frustrating coiling**. NIO in particular lately has been moving slower than a white man in slippers.  TSLA is a pricey ass premium, so maybe consider focusing on NIO or call spreads.

**BONUS**: QS earnings could be when they finally reveal their revolutionary technology which prevents dendrites. This is the holy grail of EV battery production, and they boldly claim they have figured it out. The lawsuit is standard hot air from people upset their stock tanked in this weird ass meme of a market and I am unbothered. 

**WKHS dip feels like it was a blessing,** but I may wait for a little more dip on Tuesday because this thing is streaky as fuck.  People could be positioning into the Q2 (hopeful) EV deal announcement with the USPS.

As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of ""My 600 LB Life"", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: 
Random twitter ---&gt; Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----&gt; random analyst upgrades ---&gt; CNBC pump ----&gt; several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn

**General theme I am seeing:**

*Call flow into into big tech has really, really dried up*.  I'm hoping this continues into next week, because then we could be in a really nice position to pick up some March and April monthlies in struggling behemoths like FB.  TWTR is doing it's thing, but it seems like the looming AAPL privacy concerns have put a stranglehold on other big tech companies relying on advertising data.

**Play I just like this week:**

[PLTR reports Tuesday Premarket](https://i.imgur.com/MkoiiWz.jpg) and I think there is a chance to hop on no matter the outcome.  Sells off because earnings these days are stupid?  Buy the dip.  Starts to rocket off some news or a beat?  Hop on.  PLTR feels like a win-win rn at this price point no matter the earnings report brings.

Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.

Treasury yield also has been stubbornly climbing.  Long story short, these are caution flags for an outflow from stonks into stable long-term securities.  Not ringing the bear alarm, but just shit you should know.

I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)

**TLDR**: 

Tech calls drying up for the meantime, looks like the outflow could be headed to speculative sectors, particularly EV.  Potential DOW flight coming.  Hedge with VXX pretty heavily, and retail that is doing digital integration may get the proper spotlight now post-meme.

Okay, we know the heavily shorted stock mentioned came off the Threshold list on Feb 3rd. That means they covered almost all of their FTD's (faild to deliver). Many of these were bought in the open market at high prices, however many people have speculated that it doesn't seem to be enough. The market Volume was very low and the sellers to buyers ratio was also very low. could that be enough? They were on the threshold list for 39 days straight and they covered it all in just a few days? Maybe. But what if it wasn't enough? Where did they get the rest of the shares they needed? Remember, if they don't deliver in 13 days after the 3 day settlement period is up, then they lose the right to short sell forever. That is why they have to buy at the higher prices and that is the main reason, along with the hype, that the stock price spiked. 

Now lets introduce another player into the game called the etfs.  There are several ETF's that have the geemee stock as part of their portfolio. I have only looked at one. you can  check out the other ones  too. Apparently there are 79 ETF's which hold the stock.  I checked out ex are tee. Their chart looks very similar to the chart of  the stock mentioned And it is one of their main stocks that make up part of their fund. Maybe Coincidence? 

Now, the etf went ON the threshold list on January  29th and has remained there to this very day! IT did not appear on the securities threshold list a single day this year before jan 29th That is the same day that the the short sellers supposedly covered most of their short positions and the geemee spike started to drop as well as about the same time the brokers stopped letting people trade!  This etf currently sits at 190% short float. Peaking on 2/1 at over 800% short float!  As of 11feb2021, they also only hold 454,595 shares(3.36% of the fund) of the mentiopned stock, coming down from a high of roughly 19%.

 

[outstanding shares of the etf](https://preview.redd.it/fcfu9kpisth61.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5484039e4707243d234da8a633f8f5c3af844e1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Shares shorted of the etf](https://preview.redd.it/b6aalo74sth61.png?width=354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98c590c3113485e44c1839fe748be0918f582c17)

 There is a possibility that  the ETF's that had shares of geemeee were used to cover the failed short positions so that it would come off the threshold list. This would create the image that the opportunity is over, however then  the ETF's involved would be now in the exact same position that the stock was in just before the spike. This would  just move the crisis from one place to another. 

This procedure can be mainly done by naked shorting the stock.  If a manager wants to short a single stock, but they don't want to go to the extent of borrowing and disclosing the short, they would short an ETF that holds the stock, and simultaneously buy long the underlying holdings that they don't want to short. This Naked shorting ETFs is generally acceptable due to arbitrage, but if one goes long on the remainder of the holdings (not many in the mentioned etf), one can naked short the stock without doing any arbitrage on the ETF. This, when coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes the heavily shorted stock off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be, and provides the ability to naked short the stock again.

&amp;#x200B;

[Comparison of the ETF short positions and the underlying stock](https://preview.redd.it/hrg8gx2lrth61.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01cba928637efebe0e584c2796ea04e46bd52056)

 This is a likely scenario how geemeee could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive the stock down outside of buying puts. Theres list of etfs holding this stock. They can all be used in the same way. Thats a theory right now. All figures indicated that the % of shorts went down without any real price movement that should have reflected this. This would be the explanation.

For all the retards rubbing their hands now: It's very unlikely to squeeze an ETF because managers will just buy more shares of the underlying and issue more shares of the ETF. They don't need shareholder approval or prior announcement to issue new shares as do single companies. And other banks and funds can buy shares of the underlying and create more shares of the ETF themselves as APs.

I‚Äôm a fan of DFV the man, but I‚Äôm more interested in really **really** deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you‚Äôll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  


For those of you kids who can‚Äôt read good, I‚Äôll put the **TLDR** right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it‚Äôs almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don‚Äôt mean by a little bit‚Ä¶ I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  **A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00**  I‚Äôll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets ‚Äì which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it‚Äôs trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at &lt;3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be &lt;1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  


Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will ‚Äì hell, sell it short if you want ‚Äì but I like shares and calls.


**KT CORPORATE PROFILE**

KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 ‚Äì but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form ‚Äì with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA &amp; Poland.  KT is South Korea‚Äôs first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:


**Line of Business** | **% of Korean Market Share**
:--|--:
Mobile Services | 31.4%
Fixed-line local telephone &amp; VoIP | 64.9%
Broadband Internet Access | 40.9%
Pay TV Services | 31.6%


As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.

**Products &amp; Services** | **% of Total Revenue**
:--|--:
Mobile Services (incl. 5G) | 27.3%
Fixed-line (incl. VoIP, broadband, data comm.) | 19.5%
Media &amp; Content | 10.1%
Financial Services (incl. credit card solutions) | 14.6%
Other (incl. IT, network services, real estate development) | 11.6%
Sale of goods (primarily mobile handsets) | 16.8%


Corporate Location Map:

https://i.imgur.com/syXIRxy.jpeg


KT has ~30% institutional ownership, with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020.  KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it‚Äôs worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You‚Äôd literally have to be insane to short it ‚Äì it‚Äôd be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  


**FINANCIAL METRICS &amp; PEER COMPARISONS**

KT‚Äôs balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  


Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:

https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg


Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):

https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg


Compared to industry peers/comps:

https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg


The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, **it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.**  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real **deep fucking value.**

https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg


Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%. 

https://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg


They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:

I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.

Everyone looks for the **TLDR** at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:

Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

I only see whining and retards complaining. It's NOTHING, compared to timeframes we seen on WSB so far and you still can't get your ass up and fucking HOLD and believe in what we want to achieve.

When the stonk blew, we couldn't stop the posts and memes about how GME is going to moon and everybody was circlejerking, but as soon as some retards on wallstreet spread lies and change rules, you hush and start being nervous and SELL. WHAT IS WORNG WITH YOU RETARDS? They got EXACTLY what they wanted. And you know what the worst part is?

**YOU RETARDS EVEN TOLD US THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN.**

Did you think that the hedge funds would just run away in fear and loose their face AND money? Didn't you think they'd fight with dirty moves and get away with it? Haven't you learned from 2008?

Face it! We're apes. And now we're not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?

I'm not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270‚Ç¨ for 2k‚Ç¨, because I have debts of 10k‚Ç¨ and a lawsuit going against me. I can't afford to pay back anymore because COVID made me loose my job. I'm basically fucked and don't know what to do and stand with my back at the wall. But guess what?

**I STILL HOLD.**

This isn't about money anymore. This isn't about saving before shit goes down. This isn't about believe that the squeeze will come.

**This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.**

And so should you! Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.

For ONE fucking time in your life - just do **NOTHING** and **HOLD**.

WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is. And if they played by the rules, we'd have fucked them in a very autistic and ironic way. But guess what. War isn't held by rules.

tl;dr: you sell = bad monke. you hold = we'll see us on moon

Upper_Piano1809,0.0,2132.0,"There is only one answer as to how on Earth 140% shorting was allowed. This is due to the concept of naked shorting...

this in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don‚Äôt believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.

Why does this even matter? It‚Äôs because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the ‚Äòfailure to deliver‚Äô system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more... 

Think about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It‚Äôs because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn‚Äôt sell when it went down why? Well it‚Äôs simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. 

Now back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen‚Äôs and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF‚Äôs as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that‚Äôs our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it‚Äôs a great time to be alive!

And although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won‚Äôt be able to be deductible since it‚Äôs made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it‚Äôs corruption vs the people. Unity will prevail if we stay strong together üíé

**TLDR: GameStop‚Äôs Congress hearing is on Feb 18th, they need to investigate the Prime Brokers and DTCC for their complicity in enabling naked shorting within GME and by extension, potential collusion to shut down trading on Jan 28th, the day the short squeeze was going to kick off.** (stick to the end for an analysis of some illegal tactics short side hedge funds have been using)

Thesis: On the day the retail market for GME shut down on 1/28 (the day the short squeeze would‚Äôve happened had there been no market intervention), DTCC (clearing house monopoly) shut down retail buying in order to protect itself and Prime Brokers **(which privately own the DTCC)** from being exposed to the consequences of being party to illegal activity. I believe Prime Brokers and DTCC need to be called to the GameStop hearing on February 18th to be questioned for their complicity in enabling illegal naked shorting of the GME stock, as well as potential collusion to shut out retail buyers on 1/28.

In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/) (which I recommend reading for some context) I explored the subject of rampant illegal naked shorting in GME, and how Prime Brokers (consisting of banks like Goldman, Morgan, etc) and DTCC would be complicit in the naked shorting. This in turn raises the thought experiment that they would be incentivized to do anything possible to prevent the short squeeze from happening on 1/28 because had the short squeeze happened, the shorts would go bankrupt and their Prime Brokers who lent them their naked shorted shares would need to cover the shares. This would not only represent a humongous capital expense for Prime Brokers, the culpability of Prime Brokers (and that of the DTCC) in this situation would also have likely been exposed as well.

A quick primer on what a Prime Broker is: Prime Brokers are essentially the service side of the short- selling business. They lend out securities and cash, you can think of them as the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù in a casino: They provide a gambler with markers to play and to manage his winnings. According to Matt Taibi, ‚ÄúUnder the original concept, if a hedge fund that wanted to short a stock they would first need to ‚Äúlocate‚Äù the stock with his Prime Broker but as time passed, Prime Brokers increasingly allowed their hedge-fund customers to use automated systems and ‚Äúlocate‚Äù the stock themselves, and what this does is enable short-sellers to sell stock without delivering and thereby perform naked shorts with counterfeit shares. (source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)). (I highly recommend you read[ Matt Taibi‚Äôs article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/) on naked shorting and how it was used to take down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. There are so many parallels with GME it‚Äôs hard to miss. It‚Äôs amazing to consider that 12 years after this article was published and brought to public awareness, the problem of naked shorting still exists as a systemic issue.)

Prime Brokers have a long history of being associated with naked shorting. To highlight a few examples, Prime Brokers like Merill Lynch and Goldman have long been implicated for naked shorting Overstock.com ([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/), [https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx\_lm\_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f](https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx_lm_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f)). Another example is when Goldman‚Äôs Prime Brokerage was implicated by the SEC in 2016 and got away with a small fine of 16 million (Source: [https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)). An example that very recently came in the news is a story where CIBC, BOA, UBS and TD Bank Prime Brokerages are accused of facilitating naked short selling and using counterfeit stock to attack and bring the stock price of a company from $34.77 to $1.83 (Source: [https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\_id=224548](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548)).

The DTCC also has a very long history of being associated with naked shorting. The Wall Street Journal noted that 1% of the DTCC‚Äôs volume end in failure to deliver which ‚Äú**have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices‚Ä¶ DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.** ‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)). The DTCC has also had numerous complaints submitted to the SEC for enabling naked shorting (source: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm)) and have been sued tens or hundreds of times for assisting naked shorts (source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/) and [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) and [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

On 1/28 Robinhood received a letter from the DTCC at 4 am requiring them to halt trading or come up with [3 billion dollars](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/), which Robinhood did not have, and therefore with one swoop of the pen the DTCC shut down buy side momentum but strangely allowed selling. Retail investors were shut out of the market and as any student of microeconomics would know, by shutting buy but only allowing sell, the price is bound to fall. Meanwhile while hedge funds were able to keep trading not only in the market but also [crosstrade in the dark pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/) (‚Äúprivate‚Äù stock markets that retail is shut out of, more on this later), and use this crucial lifeline given to them by the DTCC to prevent the squeeze from happening that day.

With retail abruptly being shut out from buy (even cash accounts were shut out, which didn‚Äôt make sense) and only allowed to sell, almost everyone could smell manipulation was afoot (which triggered the Congress hearing) and the most of the blame was pointed at Robinhood. Personally and in hindsight, I believe Robinhood was just a willing scapegoat. When we think about who had the most to lose if a short squeeze occurred, I‚Äôll narrow it down to three entities, Shorts and their stakeholders (ie Citadel), Prime Brokers and the DTCC.

It‚Äôs important to remember that the actual impetus that triggered the shutdown of the market for retail investors came from the DTCC. Working backwards, if you consider that GME was rampantly naked shorted and DTCC and Prime Brokers would have to be complicit in it, I believe the DTCC, Primer Brokers and possibly Citadel (who provides 40% of Robinhood‚Äôs revenue) brazenly manipulated the market on 1/28 by shutting down purchasing for retail buyers to prevent the squeeze from being squoze on that day as doing so would be catastrophic for all aforementioned parties involved. **I believe that on the upcoming Gamestop Congress hearings the Financial Services Committee needs to call on decision makers of DTCC and Prime Brokers explore their role and complicity in the shut out of retail buyers that day as well as being enablers of naked shorting in GME.**

**The main Prime Brokers (based on assets held under custodianship) of Melvin Capital are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan** [**https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf**](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)**, all three firms sit on the board of the DTCC** [**https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board**](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board)

An interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if Prime Brokers had margin had called the shorts, they would presumably also also gone down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call and instead the most logical option would probably would have been to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think most likely happened.

If you‚Äôve read up to this point, you might be thinking what can I do about this? I am aware that there a lot of cynicism that we can‚Äôt do anything, that there will be no justice for retail investors who were harmed this situation, and that institutions and people in power will prevent anything from being done. I feel this sometimes too, but remember:

**A single voice can be drowned out, but if we all speak together then we will make our voice heard. Ape Strong Together.**

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

What follows should probably be a separate post, but I will take the opportunity to summarize some of the illegal tactics that shorts have been identified to be using in their war with retail investors. Note that this may not be an exhaustive list and there may be newer tactics deployed in the future. Retail investors might not have the same tricks, resources and willingness to break the law for profit as hedgies do, but my hope and belief is that if we pool our knowledge and analysis, we will figure out their game and effectively adapt.

Feel free to forward the list below to any representatives and lawmakers if you concur that these tactics were used:

**Rampant Naked Shorting -** With the [extremely high number of Fail to Delivers (FTID](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)) , [short interest being as high as 226% recently](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl), [and institutions alone holding a staggering 177% of the total float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the) (likely due in large part to counterfeit shares), signs strongly point to GME being rampant with naked shorts and counterfeit shares. I believe the original goal of shorts was to drive GME to bankruptcy with these naked shorts, using [the laddering of naked shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) (aka short ladder attack), executed with the help of counterfeit stock which is a classic and reliable method of driving down the stock price. I believe the GME stock has seen relentlessly aggressive short attacks, especially on the week of Monday February 1st, which drove the stock price down and triggered panic selling.

**Masking Shorts with by Shorting ETFs that hold GME** (Can't link due to WSB, will put in comments)

**Ladder Attacks with the help of Dark Pools** \- Another identified method of ladder attacks was identified to come from [crosstrading with darkpools (the stock market has its own private stock exchange where institutions can trade‚Ä¶)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/). Essentially darkpools are private stock markets retail investors do not have access to, where short side funds can purchase securities ‚Äúoff market‚Äù and then sell ‚Äúon-market‚Äù, with the effect of creating a lot more downward pressure on the market without the upward pressure from buying.

**Illegally masking shorts with synthetic longs**. Another tactic shorts are suspected of using in GME is the use of illegally using options to evade short positions in violation of Reg SHO which SEC describes in [this risk alert](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-151) and which I elaborate in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). Essentially it‚Äôs the use of using options to create synthetic longs to illegally and artificially cover and prolong short positions and at same time obscuring the true short interest %. If you consider that it would be far more profitable for shorts to not cover at high prices but instead ladder attack the price and wait for retail investors to lose interest and close their shorts at as low of a price as possible, then you can see why this strategy would be very effective.

**Using way out-of-money call options to obscure true short interest.** You may have heard about the 43 million worth of 800 dollar calls purchased when the price was 100 and found it odd. Later it was identified as a tactic to cheaply purchase synthetic call options (since at 800 its way out of money) to obscure their short positions (with the added benefit of hedging at 800 if a squeeze does happen)

One thing I want to note, particularly to legislators at the GameStop hearing: Retail investors were not incited to pump GME. **Retail investors spotted a unique Short Squeeze opportunity created by the greed of short side hedge funds**, whereby GameStop was being abusively naked shorted with the goal of bringing it to bankruptcy, and hedge funds were so greedy about it that they shorted the company with a short interest of 226% of float, meaning A LOT of counterfeit shares were being used to short the company. **Retail investors saw this as an opportunity to short squeeze the hedge fund shorters, which is a legal and legitimate investment strategy**. The short squeeze would have happened had everyone played fair, but instead, financial institutions who were culpable to the naked shorting intervened and shut down retail buying, hurting the retail investors and successfully manipulating the market. The investment itself was in my opinion a sound decision based on the short squeeze, but in hindsight retail investors did not seriously consider the risk of the market would be blatantly and publicly manipulated and that the market would be rigged against them.

If this post was useful (and I hope it was! Gave up my Friday night to write this for you Apes), please upvote for visibility and share it far and wide. **The GameStop hearings could be a first step and hope towards legislative change, and it‚Äôs extremely important that the right story is told at those hearings (and by the right story I mean the real truth of what happened**.) I hope the truly culpable parties are investigated and brought to justice. Again, I know many of us feel cynical that anything meaning will be done towards finding justice against the lawbreakers in this case, but **if you feel even an ounce of injustice or empathy at how retail investors were unfairly harmed in the course of investing in GME, I strongly urge you to contact a legislator associated with the GameStop hearings and bring this to their attention so they can review this case with more complete information. In addition I recommend you to contact the SEC and any journalist you know or via journalist tip lines. It‚Äôs not going to be easy but the more awareness we raise the higher the likelihood our voices will be heard and positive change will be made.**

Ps. If you‚Äôve read to the end, I‚Äôll leave you with a few more thoughts and reminders:

\- If I were to distill life into one thing, it would be to never lose hope.

\- Remember that if you‚Äôve lost money in any way shape or form, don‚Äôt be depressed, money can always be made back and the important thing is to maintain a good attitude.

\- Only invest what you can afford to lose.

\- Perhaps the most important factor in good investing is patience.

That‚Äôs 45 million in 2 days. That‚Äôs 75%ish of the float(I ain‚Äôt got a fucking calculator). 

This is not including puts and calls.  

The  short volume has been bigger than DFVs diamond space hopper testicles. Considering the huge price drops today there is no way the 33 mill shorts today have been covered.

**The more things change, the more they stay the same. There is nothing new under the sun.**

&amp;#x200B;

In every market bubble, you always hear the same language, the same rationalizations, the same absurd arguments. These people think they are offering some new, unique insight... in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history. Let's address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Interest rates are low. Nowhere for money to go except stocks.**

When you really drill down into it, this is some bizarre logic. It's essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable. In other words, it's a manifestation of the greedy, FOMO mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles.

Ultimately, these bull aren't even arguing that we aren't in a bubble. They are arguing we are in a bubble, but that the bubble is JUSTIFIED.

The obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a low-interest rate environment. What's the worst that can happen if I sit on a pure cash portfolio? I lose \~2% per year. Not good, of course, but not the end of the world either. What's the worst that can happen if I dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes? I lose 50%+ of my funds in as little as a month. Ouch.

The idea that I'm forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing 2% a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset.

Of course, the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply won't crash... or, that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious. But the whole point is that the crash is never obvious, especially to permabulls. They see a dip, and they buy it. They see a deeper dip, what a great opportunity, so they buy more. And before they realize the dip isn't simply a dip, they are already fucked. Tale as old as time.

The funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment, no matter how irrational. Why hold cash when bonds pay more? Why buy bonds when index funds pay more? Why buy index funds when SPACS pay more? Why buy SPACS when flipping cocaine pays more? After all, if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible, since it loses to inflation, what sort of high risk investment can you not justify?

What's most interesting is that this argument isn't even new. The ridiculously low interest rates set by the Fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the 2008 crash. The Fed is ultimately a bubble creator, something even WSB is well aware of...

**2) If you sit out this rally you will end up behind, even if you are right.**

This is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls. They argue that if you sat out the last 10 months (something this is essentially a straw man argument, except in reference to perma-bears), then you would have missed out on massive gains. And therefore, the implicit argument is, you can NEVER sit out.

If you carefully analyze this argument, you will realize it is literally nothing more than FOMO to the extreme. It's Fear Of Missing Out disguised as macroeconomic theory. I have to stay in the market perpetually, I can never sit out, because if I do I will MISS OUT on gains. And you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too, dummy!

First of all, I will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately perma-bears. People who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains. But not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are perma-bears. There are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble, and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out, they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed.

An intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear. They adapt to the market. And when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market, you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid perma-bear. The bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them, but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history.

&amp;#x200B;

**Major Indicators of the Great Bubble**

&amp;#x200B;

**1) MASSIVE retail investment. Worldwide.**

What are some signs of bubbles, historically? Well, a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market. Do we have that today? CHECK, on fucking steroids. We've got people who can't change a fucking tire on their 2008 Civic downloading Robinhood and gambling options on margin. Like WTF?

The 80 IQ mongoloid who was washing dishes at Papa Johns last Tuesday (do they even have dishes? I don't fucking know) is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking China or some shit. Are you kidding me? Do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching?

Not to mention the entire short-squeeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire... Now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in Bangladesh is downloading Robinhood to buy calls on fucking SNDL or whatever the fuck.

Past US market bubbles were largely restricted to the US population. It was mostly Americans buying American stocks during the dotcom boom. But wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized. Now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into Tesla at a 1,300 PE ratio. What's that noise? Is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance?

The ""Max Pain"" theory (which is ironically popular among permabulls) argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors. This is of course bullshit, but it's food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo.

https://preview.redd.it/7r7kv00v3yi61.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d74d856187f569d73e04c47746f4a8bd16f700c

**2) Ridiculously speculative ""investments."" AKA SPACs.**

CCIV is worth 15 billion dollars. And it owns literally nothing. No deal is in place, no announced deal figures have been offered, obviously the SPAC has no earnings or revenue to speak of... just 15 billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium. I can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed.

What is a SPAC, at the end of the day? A rich guy steps up and says ""give me your money, and I'll decide what I'll do with it in a few months...""

And a million retards step up and say ""SOUNDS GREAT!!! TAKE MY MONEY!!!""

Tell me this SPAC shit isn't exactly like the dotcom boom, when literally anything with a .com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the ""hot new thing."" There is no way this SPAC mania lasts, and lots of people will be hurt in the end.

**3) Options volume absolutely exploding.**

Options are becoming the vehicle of choice for ""investors"" AKA gamblers in the current market. Stock represents actual ownership of a company, the foundation of the actual market. But what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term? I just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker.

The question I sometimes ask is how much of this market ""growth"" is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume. You know, like derivative CDO's leveraging worthless mortgages back in 2008? It's something to think about.

I'll just leave this chart here, since it makes the case for me. This is neither natural nor sustainable.

https://preview.redd.it/r8fw4d8x3yi61.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71fba76d2aba8f7cc69891f6b71cc1a0d6b0875c

**4) ""Greater Fool"" logic.**

I'll just quote investopedia since I'm getting lazy here...

""The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.

""If acting in accordance with the greater fool theory, an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality. If the theory holds, the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another ‚Äúgreater fool,‚Äù who could also be hoping to flip them quickly. Unfortunately, speculative bubbles burst eventually, leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices.

""The greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances, as well, including economic recessions and depressions. In 2008, when investors purchased faulty mortgage-backed securities, it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed.""

Basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy. Nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value. This is talking about you.

https://preview.redd.it/rldwaltx3yi61.jpg?width=415&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d3de4faea5a050df1c346dd278b1e18302b9a9e

**5) Buffet Indicator through the roof.**

The Buffet Indicator has reach it's highest ever level. For noobies who don't know what this means, the Buffett Indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by US GDP. A very high Buffett Indicator suggests an overvalued market, and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom.

There are two arguments against the Buffett Indicator as a useful metric. The first argument is that GDP is a backward indicator and therefore doesn't account for future growth. While this is true, it misses the entire point. The point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles. The point is to tie market valuations to some real-world metric, which is necessarily backward looking.

The other argument against the Buffett Indicator, which holds more weight, is that US stocks consist of global companies and therefore aren't adequately represented by US GDP.

I will say these people have a good point, but they are also missing several nuances within GDP and market valuations, which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post. Suffice it to say the Buffett Indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation, and can't simply be discarded.

https://preview.redd.it/o40ug9fy3yi61.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf50b19f3f7019ece0ddca6ce1b010ab7db84f5e

**6) Valuations divorced from reality.**

During every major bubble, people like to come up with new, fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company. Back in the dotcom boom, companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of ""eyes."" That is, the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website.

This internet thing was a ""New Paradigm"" and so obviously we needed New Metrics to determine how valuable these companies were. Needless to say, the vast majority of these companies, many of them worth millions, were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight.

Take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation. I like to pick on Tesla, personally, because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun.

**7) Fed Manipulation.**

Most bubbles have been created by Federal Reserve control of currency and interest rates. This market is no different. They create a bubble, and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new, bigger bubble, until that pops, and so on. It's like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house.

The catch is interest rates can't drop below zero. I mean, they can... But who wants to be Japan for the rest of history?

Alright I've written enough already and I won't write a whole thesis on Fed action and its consequences for now global markets. I'll just leave this pic here.

UPDATE: CLOSED MY POSITION

So a while back I YOLOed my entire account on calls and [lost it all in 4 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/). Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

longi11,0.0,2014.0,"Corona\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

I usually stick to providing raw data, but this post has a little bit of added analysis. I don‚Äôt own $GME or $RKT (I don't actively invest to avoid accusations of bias in my data) and don‚Äôt like either stock over the other. I do like WSB though and don‚Äôt like baseless conspiracy theories, and I have seen a lot of conspiracy theories flying around WSB recently without much evidence to accompany them. Most recently, I got flooded by comments like this on my data post yesterday.

[Comments](https://preview.redd.it/baa7ritypuk61.png?width=1432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6b8eab6ff5519aac82a87a06e742d52aa74440e)

&amp;#x200B;

The goal of this post was to look at one of those theories and see if I can provide a base for it. The theory in question is ‚Äú$RKT discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $GME‚Äù. A TLDR of my analysis is:

**A) Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB.**

**B) Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT**

**C) There are a small, but non-zero, number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME. However, this is done with no relation to $RKT.**

**D) Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**

Through my analysis I wasn‚Äôt able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME. While it‚Äôs easy to complain about u/zjz's iron-fisted bot army, I think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation.

Now I will provide the data backing up these conclusions, and call out one account I did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB. Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT.**

I don‚Äôt think I need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently. Obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters, and that‚Äôs fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $GME and $RKT first joined the wsb community. The motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $GME.

The average $RKT poster first posted on wsb on December 10th, 2020. This is pretty shockingly young, but the average $GME poster is even newer to the community with an average date of December 22nd, 2020.

Here are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community, by year:

[RKT Histogram](https://preview.redd.it/qp652yp7quk61.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cc3b954aea59a00e2a3f0e570b825e614c0cec0)

&amp;#x200B;

**There is a non-zero number of people trying to manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME, but not enough to have a significant effect.**

One other thing I examined was how much different accounts were shilling $GME and $RKT. For the most part, there wasn‚Äôt too much spam of either ticker by individual accounts with a few notable exceptions. Below are scatter plots showing accounts with the date they joined WSB on the x-axis and the number of times they have mentioned $GME/$RKT in the last 5 days on the y-axis.

There are 3 prominent outliers that I will examine, one of which I think probably deserves some sort of moderator action. On the $GME graph we have /u/char1101g way out in the upper right. He just started posting on here yesterday, and has been just absolutely spamming anti-GME shit since. Although posts like ""SELL YOU GME STOCK"" seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a short-only investor, I don't really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial anti-GME push.

On the $RKT side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people, so I don‚Äôt want to call them out by username. While I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts (old accounts, lots of personal info, lots of non-wsb posts), they‚Äôre absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads, with dozens of comments already today. You could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $RKT all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion, but given that it‚Äôs just two random dudes I kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things.

**Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**

The last thing I wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $GME and $RKT. In particular, I wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly. I ended up not finding much of a significant difference. Below is a table where $GME/$RKT accounts are defined as accounts mentioning each respective stock.

&amp;#x200B;

|Mentions of $RKT/$GME over last 5 days|$RKT accounts|$GME accounts|
|:-|:-|:-|
|\&gt;1|.806|.801|
|\&gt;2|.653|.657|
|\&gt;5|.454|.433|
|\&gt;10|.331|.310|

&amp;#x200B;

There's a pretty small overlap (34%) between people talking about $GME and people talking about $RKT, likely leading to some of the conflict that we have seen, but from my research I wasn't able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME.

&amp;#x200B;

They claim to have inside info that the short position loss for Melvin was as high as $16.8B at one point, before they were bailed out by Citadel.  According to earlier reporting, Melvin ended January with $8B in assets.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Melvin was worth $22.6B in their 13F filing on 12/31 back when the share price was $20.  $22.6B-$16.8B= $5.8B. Add the $2.75B bailout that they received from Citadel, and you wind up with $8.5B in assets at the end of January, which roughly checks out with the CNN reporting. So I believe that CNBC's info is genuine.  They go on to speculate about whether or not Gabe Plotkin effectively now works for Citadel due to the terms of the bailout (or what I like to call Citadelvin now that the two are so intertwined). They're not talking about Vlad working for Citadel, (I think  Cramer was confused, what else is new) so put away your torches and pitchforks, for now...

What's interesting is that they say that the loss has since ""come down from there"", and then they received the bailout to ""keep going"".  Remember when Gabe Plotkin called up CNBC in the wee morning hours and claimed to have covered their positions back when price was in the low hundreds before the first squeeze? Up until that point, that was an ATH, so then how did that loss come down if they had exited GME?  The way I see it either 1 of 2 things happened:

&amp;#x200B;

1. They told the truth about closing their shorts or covering with synthetic longs and then re-initiated a net short position later to try and make some back on the decline of the first squeeze.
2. They were lying about covering their original GME positions at all and that $16.8B loss amount was at the peak of the squeeze and was mitigated as the price came back down.

&amp;#x200B;

If first scenario is true, then it means that Citadelvin decided that it was time to take their medicine and get out when the price was in the hundreds, and then a couple days later decided it was a good idea to try to time the peak of the squeeze perfectly at $400 to reinitiate shorts and make some money back.   Maybe that happened and Citadelvin have since exited when GME came back down to the $40 range, maybe the price action we're seeing now is due to Citadelvin finally exiting their net short position, maybe Citadelvin still has a net short position and are in big doo-doo. No matter what, this info that Melvin has recouped some of their losses suggests that the chances are high that Citadelvin maintained a significant net short position into February and may still have a net short position.

Hey retards, we are so close to seeing this GME &amp; AMC thing through.

Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.

**This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.**

***How can the report be skewed?*** Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?

You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!** You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.

&amp;#x200B;

SUPER TLDR: üö®üö®My PT is $73.5. üö®üö®

&amp;#x200B;

IF you read my first DD and got in, congrats.

Check it out if you're late to the party.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the\_rkt\_is\_fueled\_and\_ready\_for\_liftoff\_launches/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the_rkt_is_fueled_and_ready_for_liftoff_launches/)

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

&amp;#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert &amp; Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&amp;#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

üö®üö®MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS üö®üö®, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. üö®üö®

&amp;#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&amp;#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the üíéüëê , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this üöÄ. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin &amp; CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

üö®üö®MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 üö®üö®

Let's go through the numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45.

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&amp;#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, üöÄ fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&amp;#x200B;

üö®üö®My PT is $73.5. üö®üö®

üö®üö®50 TOMORROW üö®üö®

üö®üö®60 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.üö®üö®

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it‚Äôs almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn‚Äôt my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company ‚Äì the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this ‚Äì Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government‚Ä¶.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji‚Äôs to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Let‚Äôs start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won‚Äôt be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don‚Äôt have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don‚Äôt fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers‚Äô base isn‚Äôt neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That‚Äôs the reason why their products aren‚Äôt so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn‚Äôt sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the ‚Äúrest of the world‚Äù for you. But this wasn‚Äôt so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information‚Äôs are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

‚ÄúGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.‚Äù

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù and it‚Äôs directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

‚ÄúAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.‚Äù

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn‚Äôt happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like ‚Äûlook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions‚Äú. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn‚Äôt get the contracts. This was also the ‚Äûswamp ‚Äûtrump was talking about.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn‚Äôt possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it‚Äôs ended? Well Peter‚Äôs wife doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and ‚Äûbest practices ‚Äûin the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&amp;#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it‚Äôs not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It‚Äôs a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let‚Äôs talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn‚Äôt tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it‚Äôs difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can‚Äôt ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don‚Äôt understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don‚Äôt have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don‚Äôt understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That‚Äôs why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn‚Äôt happened yet. That‚Äôs why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn‚Äôt possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I‚Äôm not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash‚Ä¶

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it‚Äôs miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don‚Äôt understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&amp;#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: ‚ÄúWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.‚Äù The S1 Form didn‚Äôt aged well. Actually I don‚Äôt think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn‚Äôt rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can‚Äôt avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It‚Äôs a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren‚Äôt relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn‚Äôt profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000¬ß. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&amp;#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let‚Äôs connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don‚Äôt have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don‚Äôt work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

‚ÄúThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public ‚Äî fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars ‚Äî will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves.

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don‚Äôt know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn‚Äôt had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before‚Ä¶.

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It‚Äôs not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I‚Äôm not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don‚Äôt need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What‚Äôs next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don‚Äôt got the GM deal? The stock tanked ‚Äì for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don‚Äôt expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3√ü. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don‚Äôt think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid ‚Äì long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don‚Äôt do any market activity based on my DD. I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized ‚Äúthe pumpers‚Äù. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don‚Äôt do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I‚Äôm not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

CNBC has it wrong - this didn't start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal.

You don't think there's a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn't out of stock, you'll be paying an insane premium over the spot price.

I'm not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let's stick to Retard Economics 101: if there's a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low.

Because of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30. Futures deliveries last year were already at a record:

&amp;#x200B;

But the amount of folks standing for March delivery might just break the bank... because there's just not enough Silver to deliver to everyone who wants it. That's why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say [we can't actually get the silver that we need.](https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921)

If silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand.

How to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you're responsible, April if you're a degenerate gambler.

How to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV. That fund is going to actually take delivery of 1,000 ounce bars on your behalf.

Positions: $PSLV shares, $AG July calls, strike 20,  $SILJ August calls strike 25.

DON'T BUY $SLV

EDIT: I received a message from a smart dude suggesting that this news actually means that $SLV is vulnerable, and buying it is also a direct way to create tightness in the silver market. Could be.
