sfjetsetter,0.0,1566.0,"A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME

TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**.

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source: [https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

And you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to: [https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm](https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm)

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC. Here's an actual recent example where Prime Brokers are accused of coordinating naked shorting** [**https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\_id=224548&amp;navigationaction=home&amp;page=1&amp;newssection=industry**](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548&amp;navigationaction=home&amp;page=1&amp;newssection=industry)

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a commenter brought up. On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then if the squeeze was about to happen or happening, if they margin called the shorts, they would go down as well as shorts would not be able to pay and brokers would be holding the bag. They have every incentive in this case to NOT margin call because doing so might also taken them down, instead the most logical option would be to make a backroom deal which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

Also, a [compelling theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lglkwv/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/gmsll2k/) put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read",1,A historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events,1566.0,0.98,"A historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME

TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**.

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source: [https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Callkage,0.0,1525.0," I posted about this recently in a thread but, too many people blindly buy options without actually knowing what their potential outcome's are. [Options Profit Calculators](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/) can be used to show you what your potential P/L is for a trade, but it also shows you how theta will eat your option away if you buy something ridiculously priced.  From my recent interactions with people on here there's a lot of traders that don't know about these. 

Using an Options Calculator is a great tool to get a better understanding on how options will move and how to better plan your entry and exit points for a trade.

StrangeRemark,0.0,1469.0,"Know a lot of you are eagerly awaiting the short interest report at 6PM, so here's a quick read in the meantime. Whatever the number is, I'm actually inclined to agree with the AMC/GME bulls that it'll continue to be high, and even significantly understate the number of actual bearish positions (including the synthetic ones). Unfortunately, I also don't really think it matters in the mid-run.

Remember back when GME was squeezing to the max, and people noticed massive blocks of 800c's being purchased and took it as a bullish flag from institutional interest? I'm rather certain these were purchased by incoming short sellers, and here's why:

1. Let's say an institution is short 100 shares today, believing GME will drop from 50 to 30 by end of month
2. They then buy a GME 2/26 100C for $3.38, which might seem bizarre given their belief in the stock going down
3. But using this setup, they're 100% protected if GME temporarily skyrockets to 1000, so long as they leave enough collateral/liquidity to cover the delta between 50 and 100 in between. They never plan to execise the option, but leave it in place to prevent a margin call
4. If they're right, they pocket the $20 less $3.38 for the call option less interest expense per share

Call options enable you to build a hedged short position that's impossible to squeeze. You might ask why Melvin didn't do this to begin with - this is where the element of surprise in a short squeeze is really important. Year long hedges for a super rare occurrence will completely suck out your alpha, and by the time Melvin picked up on this, call options were ridiculously expensive and they were out of capital and time. If you know something's coming and the insurance is cheap, you'll definitely buy it.

I think the short interest % will continue to climb even if the price stays stable and IV goes down, as these hedges will get cheaper and cheaper to purchase. I'm sure this will be very basic to a lot of you, but figured it might be informative to the influx of Reddit new joiners in the last few weeks.

tl;dr element of surprise really important in squeezing the institutions out, and the dropping IV of late is your enemy if you wanted the squeeze to happen. I'm not recommending the position above as I don't think it's worth touching this meme overall given the multitude of other opportunities out there

Edit: For all the people smartly pointing out that this is just a normal hedge, you're right. But it's also a hedge that ironically kills the need to hedge, like flood insurance that prevents raining. So the flood insurance might be boring to you, but some of you might be missing that nuance.

My very first trade was to go and sell a 3/12 Put (for .72 premium)


But since I was nervous about my first ever options trade I set buy/close triggers if I incurred 20% losses beyond what I earned (so, buy back if premium rose to .86), or if I could retain 75% profit (so, close it out at .18 premium)

Unfortunately, I almost immediately learned that I should have paid closer attention to bid-ask spread...


There were no Asks between .72 and my limit of .86, the next Ask was at 1.00

However, this sell to close order was processed 3 times for a net sell of 20 naked calls at 48.  Despite the fact my account is not cleared for naked selling of options. However this did not appear anywhere in my account until the weekend. 

On Sunday I was told I was assigned a 2000 short position on the stock as 20 naked calls were assigned to my account. 

When I checked my filled orders, everything looked normal.  However, when I checked my history my sell to close transaction was processed 3 times, with a transaction corrections notation. Even though all 3 were listed as sell to close. 

I called on three different occasions, all three of those times they said there was bug, and they would have it fixed before market opens on Tuesday.  

It was not fixed, the market opened and closed, strange things happened in my account, but nothing got fixed. 

Called again and they were less than helpful, telling me I now had to file a claim or talk to people who were currently unavailable. They have made no attempt to contact me, and given me no guidance on what I should do with this giant short position in my account, which I do not have the financial means to close.

I have proof in the form of screen shots, not to mention my account is not allowed to sell naked options in the first place.

CompulsionOSU,0.0,1187.0,"Hello options people.  With all the new blood in the options community, I thought it was worthwhile to update my Options guide and re-post it.  It has significantly more content than last time.  This should be really useful for newer traders, I hope it helps.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a huge amount of time learning about options and tried to distill my knowledge down into a helpful guide.  This should especially be useful for newbies and growing options traders.

While I feel I’m a successful trader, I'm not a guru and my advice is not gospel.  This will hopefully be a good starting point, teach you a lot, improve on your existing skills (if you already know the basics), and make you a better trader.  I plan to keep typing up more info from my notebook, expanding this guide, and posting it every couple months.  

Any feedback or addition requests are appreciated

*Per requests, I added details of good and bad trades I made.  Some painful lessons learned are now included.  I also tried to organize this better as it got longer.*

This guide has gotten so big it is too long for one reddit post, so now it’s two parts.  I’ll cross-link each post so you can easily jump between.

Part 1 - Beginner, training, links, and concepts focused.

Part 2 - Advanced beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced strategies.

# Here's what I tell options beginners:

I would strongly recommend buying a beginner's options book and read it cover to cover.  That helped me a lot.

I like this beginner book:[ https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GWSXX8U/ref=cm\_sw\_r\_cp\_apa\_OxNDFb2GK9YW7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GWSXX8U/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_OxNDFb2GK9YW7)

## Don't trade until you understand:

* You can lose your entire contract value when buying.
* You can lose a lot of money when selling ""naked"", theoretically unlimited.
* How option expiration works.
* Theta (decay) and how it works.  This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling. [ https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)
* DTE: Days till expiration/expiry
* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.
* Understand all the Greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The Greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)
* Options positions with respect to price:
   * ITM: In the money; strike is below stock value.
   * ATM: At the money; strike is just at or above the stock value, often very highly traded.  Can be very effective with moderate - long term expiry.  If the stock moves favorably, an ATM option’s delta will rapidly increase.
   * NTM: Near the money; strike is above the stock value, but fairly close.  Slightly unofficial term.
   * OTM: Out of the money; price is at least a few strikes from the current stock price.  I would say 10-30% over stock price.
   * Very OTM: Not a real definition, this is essentially a lottery ticket.  Cheap, but almost certain to expire worthless unless there is explosive movement.
* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.  In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.
* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good YouTube videos on most theta strategies (linked above).  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  Θ Gang 4 life.
* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!
* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.
* Understand that some WSB recommendations are straight up high-risk gambling and factor in that information accordingly.  Be careful with Meme stocks and the survivor-ship bias on YOLO plays.  However, I love the sub and think it’s hilarious.  It has a lot of valuable information / DD if you are comfortable with the “colorful” language.  It’s also great if you like rocket ship emojis.

## Basics / Mechanics

* Understand the 4 ""main"" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex multi-legged option strategies are based off these in some way (see below)
* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock or if you own an underlying longer term option; see LEAPS and PMCCs later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and often requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and usually a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life and end up living in a dumpster eating saltine crackers.
* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold ""naked"" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as increasing risk.

# General Tips and Ideas:

* Don't EVER leave (short) spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)
* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).  I started trading options with 5k, then 25k, 50k, and later over 100k.  I added my own funds over time and used my gains to build my account.  Don’t go all in immediately, that’s dangerous and unwise.
* Especially as you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it diversified among several stocks.
   * Don't go all in on one thing, ever.  Be able to take a hit from one stock and not mortally wound your portfolio.
   * A company may be doing great, then there's a major product issue out of nowhere.  If you are overexposed in one stock this can really hurt you.
   * I had to roll options I sold that were about to expire completely worthless because FDX's CEO changed and the stock took a hard dip.
* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.  Same if you get caught up in a wave of hysteria.
* Planning Trades:
   * Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.  This is super important for strong movements and high volatility (see later). 
   * Hedge fund guy on YouTube stated that trading should be 90% planning and 10% execution.  I agree with this more and more.
   * My rough trading outline:
      * Make a list of potentially viable stocks.
      * Perform research.
      * Set up a watchlist of stocks you want to trade.
      * Have entry and exit plans for your trades.  Setting stock price alerts for entries is my personal preference.
      * Market opens / event occurs.  React according to your plan.
      * Based on new information, adjust, open, or close positions accordingly.
* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a ""new"" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade:[ https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/
* “Rolling” an option:  
 Closing your existing option and opening a similar one at a different strike and/or expiration.
   * Rolling a call “Up” would be selling a call you own and buying a cheaper call at a higher strike.
   * Rolling a put “Down and out” closes your original one and buying or selling one at a lower strike at a longer expiry.
   * Better broker interfaces have a literal “Roll” button.  I know E-trade does.  You can manually do it by selecting relevant contract legs.
* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption is definitely incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option over stubbornness.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (or buy another call / put).  Rolling out sold options can help here.
* Don't try to day trade, especially with options.  It's statistically unlikely to be profitable.  Day-trading with options introduces extra liquidity risks and is dangerous, especially with spreads.
* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me lose my hair; luckily it eventually came back.
* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.
* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid-day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.  I’ve had success around 12-1PM EST after prices settle.
* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.
* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider ""doubling down""; note this is higher risk.  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't ever recommend shorting shares.
* Learn from your mistakes.  You can’t go back in time and beating yourself up (to a point) is useless.  Make a physical &amp;/or mental note of it so you don’t do it again.  If you don’t learn from it, then beat yourself up so you won’t do it again.
* If you have friends that like to trade, I find it helpful to discuss strategies and planned plays.  I talk openly with my close friends about my current holdings and planned trades, it helps keep me accountable.  If I get a wide-eyed look, I might be doing something excessively risky or stupid.  I’ve over-leveraged myself in calls twice and I knew I shouldn’t have done it both times.  When I tell my friends what I did and I’m embarrassed, it exemplifies the face that I shouldn’t have done it in the first place.  You will also get ideas for new strategies or plays from them.  It’s good to stay versatile and use multiple strategies when appropriate.  
 Beware of group-think/echo chambers. 
* I recommend NEVER telling someone what to buy/sell and when.  I’ll tell people MY plays or what I like and why, but I will not encourage them to emulate what I do.  Depending on the audience, I’ll tell them my exact positions along with my exit and entrance strategy.  With closer friends I’ll offer my thoughts on their trades (if asked).  If my friend is doing something really risky (one of my friends does some scary stuff) I may ask them if they want my advice, and provide it, especially if they overlooked a risk/event.  I will not encourage someone to execute/enter a trade since it has a high potential for hurt feelings or animosity all around.
* Don’t fall in love with a stock.  
 Just because something made you money before and you have high confidence in it doesn’t mean it will keep performing.  I joke that FDX betrayed me when it started dipping and losing me money.  I was over-confident of its bounce-back and sold too many puts too quickly.  I’m in several losing trades because of it.  However, I will keep good stocks in my roster/tracking list or try different strategies or re-enter trades when they change their behavior.
* As you start to both buy and sell options and get more experience in general, you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will likely click one day.  Most/all the Greeks and options concepts will become almost second nature.  For me this was when I could build an Iron Condor from scratch, which was a watershed moment involving a good understanding of many strategies.
* Understand Liquidity and volume.
   * Trading in low volume, low open interest contracts results in wide bid/ask spreads and difficulty having your contracts filled.  Look at all the data for a contract, not just the strike and price.
   * Monthly Expiration dates typically have better liquidity.
   * Multi-legged trades (Common examples are 2-legged vertical spreads or 4-legged iron condors) have more difficulty being filled, especially on bad brokers like Robin Hood.  Having very liquid options for all legs is extremely helpful in obtaining timely and well-priced fills, which maximize your potential profits.
* Time in market vs timing the market:
   * It is extremely difficult to time the market perfectly.  If you wait for the perfect opportunity forever, history has proven you will miss out on gains.  Keeping all your money out of the market has proven to be ineffective.  Now if there is something serious happening with a stock/the market (like say a new pandemic), don’t go all in.  I recommend entering incrementally at dips.  If the stock has huge upside potential it may never go down, so it might make sense to partially enter at the current price.
   * IMO selling puts is a great strategy to get into a stock you like, or at least make money off it.  I think buying stock in lots of 100 is usually for suckers.  Selling an ATM or ITM put (assuming the math works out) on a stock you were going to buy and hold is ALMOST free money.
   * I recommend keeping some cash available regardless. If you have a very large account or expect a downturn, hedging with indexes like QQQ, SPY, or VIX or calls/puts may be wise.
* Every trade can't be a winner.  You will take some losses, you must get used to it.  I don’t like having a realized loss of 1K or more on any trade.  However, this will happen, especially with larger accounts.
   * As long as you win more often and beat the S&amp;P that year I consider it okay.  I’m kind of aggressive, so I consider 20%+ annually good.  30%+ annually is great.  40%+ and I’m dancing.  After trading options I am almost baffled by my old belief that 5% annual returns (mostly from dividend ETFs) was “good”.  That’s nothing to me now since I’m willing to take risks.  
Note: While lots of people danced in 2020, realize that’s an insane Bull Run year and is atypical. 
   * Adhere to your own risk tolerance and never over-extend yourself, especially with margin use.  Don’t make huge gambles leaving you uncomfortable.  Only gamble with money you are willing to lose.
   * My personal strategy is to make safer gains for the year and then enter slightly riskier strategies using those gains.  I can be slightly-moderately more aggressive and compound my gains.  For me I often sell puts to make money, then when I see a big opportunity I’ll sell a put and buy an OTM or moderately ITM call.
* Understand it’s not safe to try and get rich overnight.  However, once you hit big “steps” things may start to snowball.  You can enter more positions and take more risks if you choose to.
   * For me this when I hit 50k, then 100k.  I was able to balance low and moderate risk positions to more significantly grow my account.  I’ll even do a high risk thing now and again because my gains can absorb it (assuming I have them).
   * I can’t wait to get to 250K, then 500K.  I know it’ll take quite a long time, but I am confident I’ll eventually be able to have 500K and (hopefully) 1M in my non-401k trading account with gains and additions from my job.  I can only imagine how “dangerous” I will be with that kind of capital.
* If you missed ""the next big thing"" like AAPL, TSLA, or the time machine I’m building in my basement.  Don't get upset, learn from it.  Adapt and become a better trader for next time.
   * Figure out why a company was so promising, before they mooned.  Determine how you would have traded differently in hindsight.  Apply those lessons to the next company you believe has long term growth prospects.
   * For me that's putting in 1-2.5k towards shares and/or buying LEAPS on it.  Depending on my bullishness I may buy “cheap”, fairly far OTM calls.  The far OTM options are sort of lottery tickets.  If I'm right the (relatively) low cost will have explosive profits; if I'm wrong, they didn't cost that much so it's a calculated loss I’m willing to accept.  For more serious bets I’ll buy ITM LEAPS to run PMCCs on.  I also like to buy 1-2K in my 401k for very long-term plays.
* The stock market hates uncertainty, it seems to crave the status quo.  A shakeup can potentially tank a stock, even if it's nothing.  With shares you can wait it out, but this can be problematic for options.  If you see volatile/uncertain times ahead (politics, disease, manufacturing, earnings, etc.), you might want to reduce your overall portfolio risks or hedge.
* Brokers:
   * Find a good broker.  This article outlines good brokers that didn’t restrict trading during the GameStop squeeze craziness.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder\_whether\_you\_own\_gme\_or\_not\_change\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder_whether_you_own_gme_or_not_change_your/)
   * I have personally used the following and here are my ratings:  
E-Trade &gt;&gt; Fidelity &gt;&gt; Ally &gt;&gt; Robin Hood.
      * The &gt;&gt; denotes they are significantly better.  Fidelity is reliable, but their interface isn’t good.  The app / site both work, but they are clumsy, “weak”, and outdated.  It’s been described as “boomer-friendly” by a Fidelity employee on Reddit.  Fidelity does have a “pro” type desktop software, it is geared toward more professional traders.
      * Ally Invest has bad tools, is generally trash, and is unreliable, don’t use it.
      * RH is free, but has bad fills.  It is super unreliable and has had huge stock buying restrictions in stocks and quantities for multiple days.  I don’t trade in their app anymore, but I do like using their wish lists for quick chart glances at daily activity.
   * I really like E-Trade (and you’re about to hear why).
      * E-trade has Power E-Trade on both desktop and mobile.  These are fantastic tools for options trading.
      * The mobile app destroys (most/all) other mobile apps in terms of organization, data available, and effectiveness.  I think it’s phenomenal.  I can throw together a 4-legged trade in seconds.  I can easily see all Greeks, intrinsic/extrinsic value, volume, and every other trade parameter I need through their option chain screen by swiping left / right.
      * *Note, I have not tried Schwab, just watched YouTube videos of their app.  From watching those, Power E trade looks better.*
      * The desktop version also has a trade analyzer (extensive P/L calculator) and a strategy seeker.  The strategy tool gives you suggested trades based on your expected movement direction, expiry date, and amount invested.  Both are well done and powerful.
      * These tools are so intuitive and powerful that I would have a hard time going to another broker, even if it’s slightly cheaper.  Even if E-Trade drops the ball again, I might keep my main account with them and set up my secondary / backup account with Schwab; that’s how much I like Power E-trade.
      * **Noteworthy downsides.**  They restricted GME buying for \~2 hours during market hours (\~2-4PM) and all after hours on Thursday 1/28/21 when the GME craziness was happening.  This was the only restriction on buying I’m aware of.  
The following week there was a day where I couldn’t execute a trade for an hour at open.  This was during very high volume, but still no excuse.  These issues made me very angry with them.  These were the first big problems I’ve had in several months of active trading through them.
      * My biggest annoyance.  Power e trade sometimes shows spreads incorrectly arranged on mobile.  On desktop you can adjust / fix the spread groups with the “Custom Groups” button, but mobile sometimes mixes two spreads or condors with the same symbol and expiry.  This shows you different things than what you set up, but doesn't actually change what you own.  For example I could open a 170/175 put credit spread and sell a 180 put.  It might get confused on mobile and say 170/180 spread and 175 put.
      * They are usually very reliable, but they are not perfect.  I’m staying with them unless they have more major issues.
      * Their options fees go from $.65 to .50 a contract once you trade enough, 30 trades / quarter I think.  They’ll give you further discounts if you trade a lot for months, then call to ask for an option fee reduction/negotiation.
      * If you decide to open an E-trade account and put enough money in, there is a new account incentive.  It scales up depending on your contribution.  If you feel like it, you can use my referral link.  PM me for it if you’re interested.
   * Rock Solid Brokers:
      * Fidelity: Mediocre-bad tools, very reliable.
      * Vanguard: Expensive.  Reliable.
      * Schwab: OK prices.  Second hand, tools look okay-good.  Very good reputation and reliable.  If I ever decide to switch / diversify from E-trade, I’m trying them.
* Don’t over leverage yourself, understand your own risk tolerance.  Don’t use up all your cash or margin buying power.  Leave funds available to react if the market turns against you.  If you use margin maintenance, ensure you have a cushion to prevent a potentially costly margin call.

# Profit Retention / Loss Mitigation

* If selling options, it is a viable strategy to close early after a large gain with many DTE left until expiry.  See TT videos / strategies on this.
* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I like playing on earnings run ups, but that can be risky.
* If you hold options through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards, devaluing the option.  However, if the option is profitable enough, IV crush won’t matter, which will still make money for a call buyer.  A sold put sufficiently far OTM will benefit from IV crush, even if the stock dips after slightly bad or lukewarm earnings.
* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.  If you are wrong and still believe in the company, wait twice as long as your original plan (wait for your 2nd entry point vs 1st) before adding to your position.
* Consider using stop losses to lock-in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  
 In December 2020 I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls I was already up on and I ""lost"" \~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big, don't get too greedy.
* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  
Close some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes into outer space/the floor.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below its current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up in little bits incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.
* Have rules when to roll out, down &amp; out, or up &amp; out.  I like TT’s roll at break even or at 1x loss and to always roll for a credit (or for me a very minor cost).  Obviously these rules need some monitoring.  Know your stocks, the news, and technicals so you don’t jump the gun.  
   * If you roll early for a credit and you’re right, it’s not the end of the world.  You’ll just need to hold longer, which will obviously tie up capital.  Sometimes it’s better to tie up some money (especially if you aren’t paying interest) than eating a huge loss.
   * Rolling too late can be worse though.  I currently have a very underwater FDX put I sold that is over 2x loss, rolling it does almost nothing unless you want to pay a debit or extend it extremely far out.
* On huge options gains, **I strongly recommend taking profits by rolling up/down** or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).
   * Rolling up involves selling your initial call, then using a fraction of your proceeds to buy a cheaper, further OTM call with the same expiry; puts are inverse this.  When rolling up I like to ensure the new option’s cost is 15-40% of my realized gains.  I’ll buy a more or less expensive replacement option based on my conviction in the stock and predicted movements.  You can also roll up and out to get a further expiry and strike.
   * This is monumentally important if you are playing with incredibly high rising stocks or during a short squeeze.
   * **Sad story time:**  
I completely screwed up when I forgot to roll up, twice, during the GME gamma/short squeeze.  I didn’t take my own advice; I didn’t have a real exit or transition plan and I got emotional.  It all happened so fast and I was at work; the insanity of the run up and subsequent gamma squeeze caught me off guard.  I should’ve clocked out and thought through the situation for 15-30 minutes to form an impromptu plan, then executed trade(s).  My moderate risk tolerance coupled with my desire to take profits took over.  When the stock partially cratered after a run up, I sold to retain gains.  In the heat of the moment I thought the squeeze was squoze and it was going to plummet into the ground and I wasn’t being rational.
      * On 1x 4K call I would’ve made an additional 15-25K if I rolled up to a cheaper contract with some of my profits.
      * I know I missed out on significantly more with a 2nd call I had.  Depending when I rolled it, it would likely have been an additional 25-50k in profits.
   * I talked about learning from your mistakes above.  **This mistake is branded into my brain due to the massive gains I missed out on** **by not rolling up****.**  I’m furious with myself as I write this 1 week after the GME gamma squeeze, I’m a planner and I didn’t plan.  If anything I own is significantly up ever again, I’m rolling up (or at least setting a stop loss).  If necessary, I’ll roll up a trade multiple times to keep extracting profits.
   * Learn from my mistake so you don’t miss out on gains too.  I strongly recommend rolling up when you are up big on a call / roll down when you are up big on a put.  This enables you to take profits, stay in the game, and keep extracting more gains.
* If you trade a lot of options, talk to your broker about a discount.  I was getting the standard $.50/contract with E-Trade, but I traded over 300 contracts a quarter and was able to get the fee reduced by over $.10 by just asking.  I am now doing more spreads and condors, so once my volume gets very high, I’ll ask again.
* If you have a broker that isn’t great and you want to switch, leverage your current trading fees to the new broker.  Tell them you’ll move over $### thousand if they beat your current options trading fee per contract.

# Trade Planning &amp; Position Management Tips

* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc. you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.
* Having rough rules to close trades early can be a smart strategy.
   * A common rule is if you hit 50% max profit in 1/3 of the contract length, close it early.
   * A slightly more aggressive rule, that I roughly adhere to, is if you hit 66% max profit in \~1/3 the contract length, close it early.
   * If you sell “naked” / on margin it may make sense to keep huge winners open, especially with sold/written puts.  I sometimes keep these big winners open with only 10-20% of the value left.  I let theta slowly bleed them dry to get extra money.  I’m using my (free) naked put margin maintenance to get extra profits.  If other trades start to go bad, I’ll close these big winners to free up capital.
* Before entering a trade, look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your relevant strikes as well as entry/exit points.  Look at upcoming earnings &amp; dividend dates as well as stock/market news.
* Consider staggering strikes and expirations for safety and diversity; it’s nice to avoid assignment on 3 puts at once because you used the same strike for all 3.
* Incrementally enter positions on large rises/falls.  One of my favorite strategies is to buy dips after over reactions.  By doing this slowly in large price ""steps"" it helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.
   * This will also help you avoid ""chasing a falling knife"".  It also ties into having a plan.
   * I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.
* Don't buy far expiration options with poor liquidity for shorter term plays.  I bought 1x GME 1-year+ LEAPS call before the 2021 short squeeze.  That was stupid, I should've bought 2-3x 60-120 day calls to have better liquidity.  I also paper-handed it and missed out on my lambo.
* If selling options, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be a valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side, if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.  See rolling “rules” above.
* Covered Calls:
   * If a stock has a large movement range, I think it can be worthwhile to wait to open a CC after the last one is closed/expires.  I have been more successful waiting for another opportunity vs. opening one immediately on the Monday after the second the last one expires.
   * Consider selling covered calls at all time highs/peaks.  If you sell a CC and the stock dips significantly, and you think it’s temporary, you can buy to close your CC for a quick profit, then reopen it later.
   * If you own Meme stocks, selling covered calls runs the risk of missing out on large gains.  On these stocks I typically only sell them further OTM than I normally would or not at all.  If I do sell CC on a Meme stock I try to ensure I have 25-100 other shares that won’t be called away.
* Dead cat bounce.
   * After a huge price drop sometimes a stock will pop or partially recover temporarily.
   * It could be a reversal or a false flag.  Be aware of this so you can react accordingly.

   * I recommend building a large roster of stocks you want to trade with and check it at least daily.  My “wheel candidate” list is 26 “solid” stocks plus 20-25 I’m lukewarm about.  I want it to be at 100-200.
   * With a large stock candidate list it makes it easy to find targets to buy dips on and exploit opportunities.  I like selling puts at dips with some downside protection.
* Below is another reddit user's more aggressive theta gang variant.  I think this has merits, I'm trying it myself with a few stocks.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k\_to\_475k\_in\_4\_months\_using\_theta\_wsb\_techniques/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k_to_475k_in_4_months_using_theta_wsb_techniques/)

* Buying calls or puts with more DTE than you need is a very smart strategy IMO.
   * Buying extra time becomes progressively cheaper after \~1 month and keeps theta from hurting you as much.  See LEAPS later.
   * I started off buying 30-45 DTE calls, then moved to 45-60 DTE.
   * Now I am tinkering with only buying calls/puts that have 90-120+ DTE (monthlies).  I plan to close these with at least 30-45 DTE left since theta starts to really depreciate your contracts at 45 days, especially at 30 days.  If I’m playing an event or a specific date, I ensure I have at least 30 days past that with whatever I purchase.
   * Buying longer dated contracts, while more capital “efficient”, is more costly.  I couldn’t do this when I had a small account.  There is also more downside risk; since the contract is more valuable, you can lose more.  I try to only have 1-3 calls open at a time in one stock so if I’m wrong I don’t get destroyed.

**Disclaimer:**

I’m not a financial advisor, I’m not an engineer.  I’m not telling you to invest in a specific stock/option or even use a specific strategy.  I’ve outlined and more extensively elaborated on what I personally like.  You should test several strategies and find what works best for you.

I'm just a guy who trades (mainly options) part-time for financial gain and fun.  I don't claim to be some investing savant.",1,My Options Overview / Guide Part 1 of 2 (V 2.5),1187.0,0.98,"My Options Overview / Guide Part 1 of 2 (V 2.5) Hello options people.  With all the new blood in the options community, I thought it was worthwhile to update my Options guide and re-post it.  It has significantly more content than last time.  This should be really useful for newer traders, I hope it helps.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a huge amount of time learning about options and tried to distill my knowledge down into a helpful guide.  This should especially be useful for newbies and growing options traders.

While I feel I’m a successful trader, I'm not a guru and my advice is not gospel.  This will hopefully be a good starting point, teach you a lot, improve on your existing skills (if you already know the basics), and make you a better trader.  I plan to keep typing up more info from my notebook, expanding this guide, and posting it every couple months.  

Any feedback or addition requests are appreciated

*Per requests, I added details of good and bad trades I made.  Some painful lessons learned are now included.  I also tried to organize this better as it got longer.*

This guide has gotten so big it is too long for one reddit post, so now it’s two parts.  I’ll cross-link each post so you can easily jump between.

Part 1 - Beginner, training, links, and concepts focused.

Part 2 - Advanced beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced strategies.

# Here's what I tell options beginners:

I would strongly recommend buying a beginner's options book and read it cover to cover.  That helped me a lot.

I like this beginner book:[ https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GWSXX8U/ref=cm\_sw\_r\_cp\_apa\_OxNDFb2GK9YW7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GWSXX8U/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_OxNDFb2GK9YW7)

## Don't trade until you understand:

* You can lose your entire contract value when buying.
* You can lose a lot of money when selling ""naked"", theoretically unlimited.
* How option expiration works.
* Theta (decay) and how it works.  This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling. [ https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)
* DTE: Days till expiration/expiry
* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.
* Understand all the Greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The Greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)
* Options positions with respect to price:
   * ITM: In the money; strike is below stock value.
   * ATM: At the money; strike is just at or above the stock value, often very highly traded.  Can be very effective with moderate - long term expiry.  If the stock moves favorably, an ATM option’s delta will rapidly increase.
   * NTM: Near the money; strike is above the stock value, but fairly close.  Slightly unofficial term.
   * OTM: Out of the money; price is at least a few strikes from the current stock price.  I would say 10-30% over stock price.
   * Very OTM: Not a real definition, this is essentially a lottery ticket.  Cheap, but almost certain to expire worthless unless there is explosive movement.
* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.  In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.
* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good YouTube videos on most theta strategies (linked above).  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  Θ Gang 4 life.
* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!
* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.
* Understand that some WSB recommendations are straight up high-risk gambling and factor in that information accordingly.  Be careful with Meme stocks and the survivor-ship bias on YOLO plays.  However, I love the sub and think it’s hilarious.  It has a lot of valuable information / DD if you are comfortable with the “colorful” language.  It’s also great if you like rocket ship emojis.

## Basics / Mechanics

* Understand the 4 ""main"" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex multi-legged option strategies are based off these in some way (see below)
* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock or if you own an underlying longer term option; see LEAPS and PMCCs later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and often requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and usually a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life and end up living in a dumpster eating saltine crackers.
* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold ""naked"" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as increasing risk.

# General Tips and Ideas:

* Don't EVER leave (short) spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)
* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).  I started trading options with 5k, then 25k, 50k, and later over 100k.  I added my own funds over time and used my gains to build my account.  Don’t go all in immediately, that’s dangerous and unwise.
* Especially as you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it diversified among several stocks.
   * Don't go all in on one thing, ever.  Be able to take a hit from one stock and not mortally wound your portfolio.
   * A company may be doing great, then there's a major product issue out of nowhere.  If you are overexposed in one stock this can really hurt you.
   * I had to roll options I sold that were about to expire completely worthless because FDX's CEO changed and the stock took a hard dip.
* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.  Same if you get caught up in a wave of hysteria.
* Planning Trades:
   * Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.  This is super important for strong movements and high volatility (see later). 
   * Hedge fund guy on YouTube stated that trading should be 90% planning and 10% execution.  I agree with this more and more.
   * My rough trading outline:
      * Make a list of potentially viable stocks.
      * Perform research.
      * Set up a watchlist of stocks you want to trade.
      * Have entry and exit plans for your trades.  Setting stock price alerts for entries is my personal preference.
      * Market opens / event occurs.  React according to your plan.
      * Based on new information, adjust, open, or close positions accordingly.
* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a ""new"" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade:[ https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/
* “Rolling” an option:  
 Closing your existing option and opening a similar one at a different strike and/or expiration.
   * Rolling a call “Up” would be selling a call you own and buying a cheaper call at a higher strike.
   * Rolling a put “Down and out” closes your original one and buying or selling one at a lower strike at a longer expiry.
   * Better broker interfaces have a literal “Roll” button.  I know E-trade does.  You can manually do it by selecting relevant contract legs.
* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption is definitely incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option over stubbornness.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (or buy another call / put).  Rolling out sold options can help here.
* Don't try to day trade, especially with options.  It's statistically unlikely to be profitable.  Day-trading with options introduces extra liquidity risks and is dangerous, especially with spreads.
* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me lose my hair; luckily it eventually came back.
* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.
* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid-day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.  I’ve had success around 12-1PM EST after prices settle.
* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.
* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider ""doubling down""; note this is higher risk.  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't ever recommend shorting shares.
* Learn from your mistakes.  You can’t go back in time and beating yourself up (to a point) is useless.  Make a physical &amp;/or mental note of it so you don’t do it again.  If you don’t learn from it, then beat yourself up so you won’t do it again.
* If you have friends that like to trade, I find it helpful to discuss strategies and planned plays.  I talk openly with my close friends about my current holdings and planned trades, it helps keep me accountable.  If I get a wide-eyed look, I might be doing something excessively risky or stupid.  I’ve over-leveraged myself in calls twice and I knew I shouldn’t have done it both times.  When I tell my friends what I did and I’m embarrassed, it exemplifies the face that I shouldn’t have done it in the first place.  You will also get ideas for new strategies or plays from them.  It’s good to stay versatile and use multiple strategies when appropriate.  
 Beware of group-think/echo chambers. 
* I recommend NEVER telling someone what to buy/sell and when.  I’ll tell people MY plays or what I like and why, but I will not encourage them to emulate what I do.  Depending on the audience, I’ll tell them my exact positions along with my exit and entrance strategy.  With closer friends I’ll offer my thoughts on their trades (if asked).  If my friend is doing something really risky (one of my friends does some scary stuff) I may ask them if they want my advice, and provide it, especially if they overlooked a risk/event.  I will not encourage someone to execute/enter a trade since it has a high potential for hurt feelings or animosity all around.
* Don’t fall in love with a stock.  
 Just because something made you money before and you have high confidence in it doesn’t mean it will keep performing.  I joke that FDX betrayed me when it started dipping and losing me money.  I was over-confident of its bounce-back and sold too many puts too quickly.  I’m in several losing trades because of it.  However, I will keep good stocks in my roster/tracking list or try different strategies or re-enter trades when they change their behavior.
* As you start to both buy and sell options and get more experience in general, you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will likely click one day.  Most/all the Greeks and options concepts will become almost second nature.  For me this was when I could build an Iron Condor from scratch, which was a watershed moment involving a good understanding of many strategies.
* Understand Liquidity and volume.
   * Trading in low volume, low open interest contracts results in wide bid/ask spreads and difficulty having your contracts filled.  Look at all the data for a contract, not just the strike and price.
   * Monthly Expiration dates typically have better liquidity.
   * Multi-legged trades (Common examples are 2-legged vertical spreads or 4-legged iron condors) have more difficulty being filled, especially on bad brokers like Robin Hood.  Having very liquid options for all legs is extremely helpful in obtaining timely and well-priced fills, which maximize your potential profits.
* Time in market vs timing the market:
   * It is extremely difficult to time the market perfectly.  If you wait for the perfect opportunity forever, history has proven you will miss out on gains.  Keeping all your money out of the market has proven to be ineffective.  Now if there is something serious happening with a stock/the market (like say a new pandemic), don’t go all in.  I recommend entering incrementally at dips.  If the stock has huge upside potential it may never go down, so it might make sense to partially enter at the current price.
   * IMO selling puts is a great strategy to get into a stock you like, or at least make money off it.  I think buying stock in lots of 100 is usually for suckers.  Selling an ATM or ITM put (assuming the math works out) on a stock you were going to buy and hold is ALMOST free money.
   * I recommend keeping some cash available regardless. If you have a very large account or expect a downturn, hedging with indexes like QQQ, SPY, or VIX or calls/puts may be wise.
* Every trade can't be a winner.  You will take some losses, you must get used to it.  I don’t like having a realized loss of 1K or more on any trade.  However, this will happen, especially with larger accounts.
   * As long as you win more often and beat the S&amp;P that year I consider it okay.  I’m kind of aggressive, so I consider 20%+ annually good.  30%+ annually is great.  40%+ and I’m dancing.  After trading options I am almost baffled by my old belief that 5% annual returns (mostly from dividend ETFs) was “good”.  That’s nothing to me now since I’m willing to take risks.  
Note: While lots of people danced in 2020, realize that’s an insane Bull Run year and is atypical. 
   * Adhere to your own risk tolerance and never over-extend yourself, especially with margin use.  Don’t make huge gambles leaving you uncomfortable.  Only gamble with money you are willing to lose.
   * My personal strategy is to make safer gains for the year and then enter slightly riskier strategies using those gains.  I can be slightly-moderately more aggressive and compound my gains.  For me I often sell puts to make money, then when I see a big opportunity I’ll sell a put and buy an OTM or moderately ITM call.
* Understand it’s not safe to try and get rich overnight.  However, once you hit big “steps” things may start to snowball.  You can enter more positions and take more risks if you choose to.
   * For me this when I hit 50k, then 100k.  I was able to balance low and moderate risk positions to more significantly grow my account.  I’ll even do a high risk thing now and again because my gains can absorb it (assuming I have them).
   * I can’t wait to get to 250K, then 500K.  I know it’ll take quite a long time, but I am confident I’ll eventually be able to have 500K and (hopefully) 1M in my non-401k trading account with gains and additions from my job.  I can only imagine how “dangerous” I will be with that kind of capital.
* If you missed ""the next big thing"" like AAPL, TSLA, or the time machine I’m building in my basement.  Don't get upset, learn from it.  Adapt and become a better trader for next time.
   * Figure out why a company was so promising, before they mooned.  Determine how you would have traded differently in hindsight.  Apply those lessons to the next company you believe has long term growth prospects.
   * For me that's putting in 1-2.5k towards shares and/or buying LEAPS on it.  Depending on my bullishness I may buy “cheap”, fairly far OTM calls.  The far OTM options are sort of lottery tickets.  If I'm right the (relatively) low cost will have explosive profits; if I'm wrong, they didn't cost that much so it's a calculated loss I’m willing to accept.  For more serious bets I’ll buy ITM LEAPS to run PMCCs on.  I also like to buy 1-2K in my 401k for very long-term plays.
* The stock market hates uncertainty, it seems to crave the status quo.  A shakeup can potentially tank a stock, even if it's nothing.  With shares you can wait it out, but this can be problematic for options.  If you see volatile/uncertain times ahead (politics, disease, manufacturing, earnings, etc.), you might want to reduce your overall portfolio risks or hedge.
* Brokers:
   * Find a good broker.  This article outlines good brokers that didn’t restrict trading during the GameStop squeeze craziness.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder\_whether\_you\_own\_gme\_or\_not\_change\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder_whether_you_own_gme_or_not_change_your/)
   * I have personally used the following and here are my ratings:  
E-Trade &gt;&gt; Fidelity &gt;&gt; Ally &gt;&gt; Robin Hood.
      * The &gt;&gt; denotes they are significantly better.  Fidelity is reliable, but their interface isn’t good.  The app / site both work, but they are clumsy, “weak”, and outdated.  It’s been described as “boomer-friendly” by a Fidelity employee on Reddit.  Fidelity does have a “pro” type desktop software, it is geared toward more professional traders.
      * Ally Invest has bad tools, is generally trash, and is unreliable, don’t use it.
      * RH is free, but has bad fills.  It is super unreliable and has had huge stock buying restrictions in stocks and quantities for multiple days.  I don’t trade in their app anymore, but I do like using their wish lists for quick chart glances at daily activity.
   * I really like E-Trade (and you’re about to hear why).
      * E-trade has Power E-Trade on both desktop and mobile.  These are fantastic tools for options trading.
      * The mobile app destroys (most/all) other mobile apps in terms of organization, data available, and effectiveness.  I think it’s phenomenal.  I can throw together a 4-legged trade in seconds.  I can easily see all Greeks, intrinsic/extrinsic value, volume, and every other trade parameter I need through their option chain screen by swiping left / right.
      * *Note, I have not tried Schwab, just watched YouTube videos of their app.  From watching those, Power E trade looks better.*
      * The desktop version also has a trade analyzer (extensive P/L calculator) and a strategy seeker.  The strategy tool gives you suggested trades based on your expected movement direction, expiry date, and amount invested.  Both are well done and powerful.
      * These tools are so intuitive and powerful that I would have a hard time going to another broker, even if it’s slightly cheaper.  Even if E-Trade drops the ball again, I might keep my main account with them and set up my secondary / backup account with Schwab; that’s how much I like Power E-trade.
      * **Noteworthy downsides.**  They restricted GME buying for \~2 hours during market hours (\~2-4PM) and all after hours on Thursday 1/28/21 when the GME craziness was happening.  This was the only restriction on buying I’m aware of.  
The following week there was a day where I couldn’t execute a trade for an hour at open.  This was during very high volume, but still no excuse.  These issues made me very angry with them.  These were the first big problems I’ve had in several months of active trading through them.
      * My biggest annoyance.  Power e trade sometimes shows spreads incorrectly arranged on mobile.  On desktop you can adjust / fix the spread groups with the “Custom Groups” button, but mobile sometimes mixes two spreads or condors with the same symbol and expiry.  This shows you different things than what you set up, but doesn't actually change what you own.  For example I could open a 170/175 put credit spread and sell a 180 put.  It might get confused on mobile and say 170/180 spread and 175 put.
      * They are usually very reliable, but they are not perfect.  I’m staying with them unless they have more major issues.
      * Their options fees go from $.65 to .50 a contract once you trade enough, 30 trades / quarter I think.  They’ll give you further discounts if you trade a lot for months, then call to ask for an option fee reduction/negotiation.
      * If you decide to open an E-trade account and put enough money in, there is a new account incentive.  It scales up depending on your contribution.  If you feel like it, you can use my referral link.  PM me for it if you’re interested.
   * Rock Solid Brokers:
      * Fidelity: Mediocre-bad tools, very reliable.
      * Vanguard: Expensive.  Reliable.
      * Schwab: OK prices.  Second hand, tools look okay-good.  Very good reputation and reliable.  If I ever decide to switch / diversify from E-trade, I’m trying them.
* Don’t over leverage yourself, understand your own risk tolerance.  Don’t use up all your cash or margin buying power.  Leave funds available to react if the market turns against you.  If you use margin maintenance, ensure you have a cushion to prevent a potentially costly margin call.

# Profit Retention / Loss Mitigation

* If selling options, it is a viable strategy to close early after a large gain with many DTE left until expiry.  See TT videos / strategies on this.
* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I like playing on earnings run ups, but that can be risky.
* If you hold options through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards, devaluing the option.  However, if the option is profitable enough, IV crush won’t matter, which will still make money for a call buyer.  A sold put sufficiently far OTM will benefit from IV crush, even if the stock dips after slightly bad or lukewarm earnings.
* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.  If you are wrong and still believe in the company, wait twice as long as your original plan (wait for your 2nd entry point vs 1st) before adding to your position.
* Consider using stop losses to lock-in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  
 In December 2020 I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls I was already up on and I ""lost"" \~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big, don't get too greedy.
* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  
Close some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes into outer space/the floor.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below its current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up in little bits incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.
* Have rules when to roll out, down &amp; out, or up &amp; out.  I like TT’s roll at break even or at 1x loss and to always roll for a credit (or for me a very minor cost).  Obviously these rules need some monitoring.  Know your stocks, the news, and technicals so you don’t jump the gun.  
   * If you roll early for a credit and you’re right, it’s not the end of the world.  You’ll just need to hold longer, which will obviously tie up capital.  Sometimes it’s better to tie up some money (especially if you aren’t paying interest) than eating a huge loss.
   * Rolling too late can be worse though.  I currently have a very underwater FDX put I sold that is over 2x loss, rolling it does almost nothing unless you want to pay a debit or extend it extremely far out.
* On huge options gains, **I strongly recommend taking profits by rolling up/down** or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).
   * Rolling up involves selling your initial call, then using a fraction of your proceeds to buy a cheaper, further OTM call with the same expiry; puts are inverse this.  When rolling up I like to ensure the new option’s cost is 15-40% of my realized gains.  I’ll buy a more or less expensive replacement option based on my conviction in the stock and predicted movements.  You can also roll up and out to get a further expiry and strike.
   * This is monumentally important if you are playing with incredibly high rising stocks or during a short squeeze.
   * **Sad story time:**  
I completely screwed up when I forgot to roll up, twice, during the GME gamma/short squeeze.  I didn’t take my own advice; I didn’t have a real exit or transition plan and I got emotional.  It all happened so fast and I was at work; the insanity of the run up and subsequent gamma squeeze caught me off guard.  I should’ve clocked out and thought through the situation for 15-30 minutes to form an impromptu plan, then executed trade(s).  My moderate risk tolerance coupled with my desire to take profits took over.  When the stock partially cratered after a run up, I sold to retain gains.  In the heat of the moment I thought the squeeze was squoze and it was going to plummet into the ground and I wasn’t being rational.
      * On 1x 4K call I would’ve made an additional 15-25K if I rolled up to a cheaper contract with some of my profits.
      * I know I missed out on significantly more with a 2nd call I had.  Depending when I rolled it, it would likely have been an additional 25-50k in profits.
   * I talked about learning from your mistakes above.  **This mistake is branded into my brain due to the massive gains I missed out on** **by not rolling up****.**  I’m furious with myself as I write this 1 week after the GME gamma squeeze, I’m a planner and I didn’t plan.  If anything I own is significantly up ever again, I’m rolling up (or at least setting a stop loss).  If necessary, I’ll roll up a trade multiple times to keep extracting profits.
   * Learn from my mistake so you don’t miss out on gains too.  I strongly recommend rolling up when you are up big on a call / roll down when you are up big on a put.  This enables you to take profits, stay in the game, and keep extracting more gains.
* If you trade a lot of options, talk to your broker about a discount.  I was getting the standard $.50/contract with E-Trade, but I traded over 300 contracts a quarter and was able to get the fee reduced by over $.10 by just asking.  I am now doing more spreads and condors, so once my volume gets very high, I’ll ask again.
* If you have a broker that isn’t great and you want to switch, leverage your current trading fees to the new broker.  Tell them you’ll move over $### thousand if they beat your current options trading fee per contract.

# Trade Planning &amp; Position Management Tips

* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc. you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.
* Having rough rules to close trades early can be a smart strategy.
   * A common rule is if you hit 50% max profit in 1/3 of the contract length, close it early.
   * A slightly more aggressive rule, that I roughly adhere to, is if you hit 66% max profit in \~1/3 the contract length, close it early.
   * If you sell “naked” / on margin it may make sense to keep huge winners open, especially with sold/written puts.  I sometimes keep these big winners open with only 10-20% of the value left.  I let theta slowly bleed them dry to get extra money.  I’m using my (free) naked put margin maintenance to get extra profits.  If other trades start to go bad, I’ll close these big winners to free up capital.
* Before entering a trade, look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your relevant strikes as well as entry/exit points.  Look at upcoming earnings &amp; dividend dates as well as stock/market news.
* Consider staggering strikes and expirations for safety and diversity; it’s nice to avoid assignment on 3 puts at once because you used the same strike for all 3.
* Incrementally enter positions on large rises/falls.  One of my favorite strategies is to buy dips after over reactions.  By doing this slowly in large price ""steps"" it helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.
   * This will also help you avoid ""chasing a falling knife"".  It also ties into having a plan.
   * I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.
* Don't buy far expiration options with poor liquidity for shorter term plays.  I bought 1x GME 1-year+ LEAPS call before the 2021 short squeeze.  That was stupid, I should've bought 2-3x 60-120 day calls to have better liquidity.  I also paper-handed it and missed out on my lambo.
* If selling options, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be a valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side, if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.  See rolling “rules” above.
* Covered Calls:
   * If a stock has a large movement range, I think it can be worthwhile to wait to open a CC after the last one is closed/expires.  I have been more successful waiting for another opportunity vs. opening one immediately on the Monday after the second the last one expires.
   * Consider selling covered calls at all time highs/peaks.  If you sell a CC and the stock dips significantly, and you think it’s temporary, you can buy to close your CC for a quick profit, then reopen it later.
   * If you own Meme stocks, selling covered calls runs the risk of missing out on large gains.  On these stocks I typically only sell them further OTM than I normally would or not at all.  If I do sell CC on a Meme stock I try to ensure I have 25-100 other shares that won’t be called away.
* Dead cat bounce.
   * After a huge price drop sometimes a stock will pop or partially recover temporarily.
   * It could be a reversal or a false flag.  Be aware of this so you can react accordingly.

* Finding stocks:
   * u/swaggymedia publishes great lists of stocks at various price points with high and low IVs.  See r/SwaggyStocks, the new subreddit.
   * Here are a few examples:
      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv\_report\_high\_iv\_tickers\_with\_share\_price\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv_report_high_iv_tickers_with_share_price_under/)
      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend\_iv\_report\_tickers\_with\_low\_iv\_and\_cheaper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend_iv_report_tickers_with_low_iv_and_cheaper/)
      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend\_iv\_report\_stocks\_with\_high\_iv\_and\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend_iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more/)
      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv\_report\_stocks\_with\_high\_iv\_and\_more\_expensive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more_expensive/)
   * I recommend building a large roster of stocks you want to trade with and check it at least daily.  My “wheel candidate” list is 26 “solid” stocks plus 20-25 I’m lukewarm about.  I want it to be at 100-200.
   * With a large stock candidate list it makes it easy to find targets to buy dips on and exploit opportunities.  I like selling puts at dips with some downside protection.
* Below is another reddit user's more aggressive theta gang variant.  I think this has merits, I'm trying it myself with a few stocks.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k\_to\_475k\_in\_4\_months\_using\_theta\_wsb\_techniques/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k_to_475k_in_4_months_using_theta_wsb_techniques/)

* Buying calls or puts with more DTE than you need is a very smart strategy IMO.
   * Buying extra time becomes progressively cheaper after \~1 month and keeps theta from hurting you as much.  See LEAPS later.
   * I started off buying 30-45 DTE calls, then moved to 45-60 DTE.
   * Now I am tinkering with only buying calls/puts that have 90-120+ DTE (monthlies).  I plan to close these with at least 30-45 DTE left since theta starts to really depreciate your contracts at 45 days, especially at 30 days.  If I’m playing an event or a specific date, I ensure I have at least 30 days past that with whatever I purchase.
   * Buying longer dated contracts, while more capital “efficient”, is more costly.  I couldn’t do this when I had a small account.  There is also more downside risk; since the contract is more valuable, you can lose more.  I try to only have 1-3 calls open at a time in one stock so if I’m wrong I don’t get destroyed.

I created a *spreadsheet to track &amp; analyze stocks.* So far it has received **21,000+ upvotes across Reddit!**

**\*\*EDIT\*\* I fixed a couple of things in the spreadsheet, make yourself a fresh copy**

[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MRjupIWNNAO4fdKkgW9QM\_IUpPrduHtKz\_JiS8JUUA/edit#gid=1116024769**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MRjupIWNNAO4fdKkgW9QM_IUpPrduHtKz_JiS8JUUA/edit#gid=1116024769)

**It consists of two sheets:**

1. **Tracker:** A way to track various stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data.
2. **Fundamental Analysis:** Pulling financial statement data, ratios and key metrics for individual tickers for analysis.

Everything is automated, the only things you have to change are the tickers and data points you want to pull.

**How to:**

1. **Open it, go to File and click Make a Copy**
2. **Follow the instructions on the ""Guide"" tab**

**Use the sheet in this way:**

1. Add new tickers to the column A of staticData
2. Sort column A of staticData by A-Z after adding new tickers
3. Add the ticker you want to analyze to A1 of fundamentalAnalysis

If  you end up ever adding new rows to Tracker or staticData you'll need to  make sure the formulas are applied to each column, do this like you  would in Excel, drag the cells down.

**Adding to the Watchlist:**

**$PSTH:** Pershing Square is a Spac managed by billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman. There is a lot of speculation in terms of price, however I will be watching this one closely because if a merger gets confirmed, it still has a lot of room to go up. However, I will not be partaking in the FOMO (fear of missing out), so if $PSTH keeps running up without pull back first, I can skip this one all together. If it does consolidate into my buy zone, I'll be getting some commons most likely. 

* Target Price: $40
* Entry: &lt;$28
* Risk: 5
* Timeframe: 2-4 months

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Worth Mentioning Again:** 

**$DKNG:**  Yesterday we were anticipating a pull back from $DKNG into our 'buy zone'.

Sure enough it happened. Tomorrow I'll be watching this one closely and putting in some orders for mid term options. I still believe this is a triple digit stock.

**$AAPL:** Tomorrow, I'll be trying again to get into either some vertical spreads or LEAPS. I still feel like $AAPL is undervalued and easily a $150-$180 stock.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**$IPOD:** This is my worst position right now. My $17.5 Feb 19th call is down 30%. However, when I rated the risk as a 5, I only went in very small. Still, I'll be looking at this one closely tomorrow. As you can see below, it is riding on the support. I am looking for it to bounce tomorrow; I might dollar cost average this position or roll it. Long term outlook is still positive.

Getting closer and closer to my goal on a Journey to $1 Million. Today my portfolio is up 4.11%, or $28,000. The biggest gainer was $SOXL and semiconductors overall.

**Adding to the Watchlist:**

**$PSTH:** Pershing Square is a Spac managed by billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman. There is a lot of speculation in terms of price, however I will be watching this one closely because if a merger gets confirmed, it still has a lot of room to go up. However, I will not be partaking in the FOMO (fear of missing out), so if $PSTH keeps running up without pull back first, I can skip this one all together. If it does consolidate into my buy zone, I'll be getting some commons most likely. 

* Target Price: $40
* Entry: &lt;$28
* Risk: 5
* Timeframe: 2-4 months

**Worth Mentioning Again:** 

**$DKNG:**  Yesterday we were anticipating a pull back from $DKNG into our 'buy zone'.

Sure enough it happened. Tomorrow I'll be watching this one closely and putting in some orders for mid term options. I still believe this is a triple digit stock.

**$AAPL:** Tomorrow, I'll be trying again to get into either some vertical spreads or LEAPS. I still feel like $AAPL is undervalued and easily a $150-$180 stock.

**$IPOD:** This is my worst position right now. My $17.5 Feb 19th call is down 30%. However, when I rated the risk as a 5, I only went in very small. Still, I'll be looking at this one closely tomorrow. As you can see below, it is riding on the support. I am looking for it to bounce tomorrow; I might dollar cost average this position or roll it. Long term outlook is still positive.

Fuzzball_Logic,0.0,835.0,"At the time of this post (Feb 10, 2021, post-8pm) APHA closed at $28.15 and TLRY closed at $67.80. With the upcoming merger (around May, right?) where APHA will be worth 0.83 for ever 1 TLRY share, that means, should both stocks trade sideways from now until the merger, APHA will be worth around ($67.80 x 0.83 = $56.27). So......if that's the case, that means if you buy the highest OTM APHA leaps ($35c, which is selling at $11.60 which is $1160/contract at the time of this post), and APHA/TLRY trades sideways until the merger happens, APHA will be worth $56.27, which means it will be over $20 ITM of the $35c strike price. And if you bought those APHA at $11.60, which means the break even is at $46.60, you will still be ~$10 ITM, which, for every one contract you buy, is $1000 gainz since the delta will be at 1.00.

This ALMOST seems like a sure thing. Why not a sure thing? Well, as the merger date gets closer and closer, there is a chance that TLRY will slowly start decreasing in price and/or APHA will start increasing in price to reach an equilibrium. Assuming a bearish stance, imagine APHA trades sideways the entire time and remains at $28.15 until the merger, and TLRY decreases in price to become the same price as APHA (ie: $28.15). which means APHA will be worth $28.15 x 0.83 = $23.36. Therefore, those $35 c strike price leaps will be OTM by ~$11. With the $35c strike price having a delta at .6868, that means a loss of 68.68 x $11 = $755.48 from your $1160 $35c leaps investment (it'll probably be more since I'm not taking gamma into consideration).

If you wanna be bearish and don't want to risk losing $755.48 out of your $1160 investment. for a $75.548 / $1160 = 65% loss on investment, then this post is not for you because you worry about the loss more than the reward (which should not be that case since we have no problems seeing GME shares waaaaay in the red while diamond handing those shares. ) Perhaps you should step away from weed-stops because there may be a chance the stocks for both TLRY/APHA crash like weed stocks crashed in 2018, which may leave your options expiring worthless.

However, my thought process is that TLRY/APHA SHOULD not crash soon (not unless it rallies too high too quickly and people think those stock are in a bubble about to pop and wanna cash out their profits before they fell so they won't be left bagholding and start selling which'll cause the stocks to drop which will/may cause panic selling from newbies here in WSB wanting to cut their losses ) before the merger (ie: Democrats are in power and speculation is good that weed will become legalized, and thus, further rallying) which means buying APHA leaps may be a good choice.

Am I mathing correctly?

If you click on my profile, you'll see that I bought 100 contracts of TLRY at 0.77 a month ago. I've since sold 75 contracts of them as the stock rallied so I could use the profits to buy leaps in other stocks and APHA. Man, had I held till now, I'd be able to sell those contracts for $346k. Oh well, gainz is gainz.

Here's a screen capture of the APHA contract I yolo'd into using some of my TLRY profits.

Look at those dates. I bought APHA leaps options the day before this post, and the morning of this post. Anyway, who's ready to lose money yolo'ing into weed stocks like I did?

**Thesis:**
Disney is going from a traditional stock into a growth stock because of Disney+ (guidance of 230m-260m subscribers by 2024). Opportunity for huge gains because of historically low IV and cheap option premiums.

$DIS traded at ~116/share before they announced Disney+ so I believe this can trade higher than 300 by EOY. The catalyst for this to happen will be during the upcoming earnings this Thursday when they report a huge beat similar to Netflix (Netflix added ~8.5m vs ~6m expected and gained 10% next day). Last quarter Disney reported they reached 73 million paid subscribers. There is a chance Disney+ already has 100m subscribers with the success of WandaVision (first Disney+ exclusive Marvel content). Disney+ is cheap right now at 6.99 but will be increased as more content is released.

So far there have been 2 original series and both are/were great (Mandalorian/Wanda Vision). Falcon and the Winter Soldier releases March 19 and subscribers will only start to snowball. Being 3 for 3 establishes a pattern and people will pick it up. 

Their original guidance for Disney+ was 60m-90m by 2024 and 10m by their first year. They had 10 million sign ups on day one alone. During their Investor day they announced 10 Star Wars and 10 Marvel Series with a ton of other content. I believe their revised guidance of 230m-260m is actually very conservative if the quality of their content keeps up.

Has benefits from being a stay at home stock (Disney+) and opening the economy back up (resorts &amp; cruises).

IMO Disney’s runup is only starting and this is an opportunity to capture the insane growth of Disney+ with long term call options. Here is a chart of Disney since the start of Disney+ up until Feb 6. This chart also has when I purchased my option positions and how much I paid.

As you can see I've been following the Disney+ saga since their investor day announcement in 2019. I was new to trading options back then and I lost a few thousand trying to sell a call spread. Never forgot how much the stock skyrocket when they announced the price of $6.99


**An excerpt from Bob Iger's book**
“We wanted the service to be accessible to as many people as possible around the world, and we had settled on a price that we estimated would bring in somewhere between sixty and ninety million subscribers in the first five years. When Kevin announced we would be selling it for $6.99 a month, there was an audible gasp in the room.”

“The response from Wall Street went far beyond anything we anticipated. In 2015, our stock dropped like a stone when I talked about disruption. Now it was soaring.”


**More thoughts:**
I have been very bullish on Disney after the markets stabilized from the COVID crash. I bought my first position because there was just a ton of upside. There was the possibility of opening back the economy from the vaccine and also revising their original guidance, which was actually hinted by their CFO during their Q3 earnings call. She said they would revisit their guidance during their next investor's day. (Which I also bought 20k more in weeklies that I closed at ~60k)

Washed_up_schmuck39,0.0,813.0,"What’s the simplest trading strategy you used that in hindsight was either really dumb or just lucky that worked for any prolonged period of time? 

Mine was jumping on the ripper 5 mins out of the gate on any of the FAANG or big tech names during the spring last year. Somehow this worked for like 4 straight months at a pretty decent rate and I grew my account by almost 150%. I’d check futures, see if we were up or down going into the open, look at how the foreign markets closed out, look at the big names and see if anything had gapped, and hone in on the largest overnight movers in that tech or large cap sphere. Using Robinhood charts and really zero technical analysis aside from a pretty elementary understand of candlesticks, I’d read just half of the first 10m candle, and if it pushed hard (which everything does right at open) I would jump in at the cheapest OTM contract that fit my normal position size. Would normally get a continuation up until like 945, a slight pull back, then continue up until the real reversal sometime around 1015-1020. I’d usually punch out right at the first sign of reversal around 1015, which meant the first long wick candle I saw I’d bail out. Ended up leaving a lot of meat on the bone on multiple occasions and I’d check back around noon to see the contract up like another 30-40%, but the goal was to lock in profit in a short time and get back to the day job. 

Kind of comical how well it worked and how much beginners luck it was, but then again expectations were basically zero so the whole mental side of it never got in the way. Kind of fascinating to think about that too and how my own ignorance was a blessing to that style. I’ve tried to go back and do it a few times seeing if I can reignite that but I honestly get in my own way with it. I now “know” too much (or think I do, which I clearly do not) and either get spooked in one way or just get overwhelmed with all the different info and make the wrong choice.

Kind of comical how well it worked and how much beginners luck it was, but then again expectations were basically zero so the whole mental side of it never got in the way. Kind of fascinating to think about that too and how my own ignorance was a blessing to that style. I’ve tried to go back and do it a few times seeing if I can reignite that but I honestly get in my own way with it. I now “know” too much (or think I do, which I clearly do not) and either get spooked in one way or just get overwhelmed with all the different info and make the wrong choice.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s no secret that $RKT is absolutely ripping. It’s also no secret that you missed the fucking rocket. Once again, you’re stuck bagholding dogshit while your friends are partying on the moon. I’m here to tell you that it’s all going to be okay. Do not FOMO into RKT while it's on its way back down to Earth. I’ve got another rocket lined up, fueled, and ready to rip. Enter $UWMC.

&amp;nbsp;

#Background

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWMC) is a company who underwrites loans for independent mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers - Instead, borrowers mainly deal with the company's loan servicing department. They recently went public through the SPAC known as GHIV, and since then, their share price has unfortunately been on a steady decline, until today.

#A Swing Play, a Value Play, and a Long Term Hold, All Rolled Into One

As /u/Winring86 eloquently stated, UWMC is a swing play, value play, and long term hold rolled into one. UWMC is in a very bullish position due to it being an ideal candidate for swing trading, value investing, and growth investing. This attracts people from a wide variety of investing backgrounds, ultimately giving it some insane exposure within the institutional, and retail spaces. Furthermore, there are a number of positive upcoming catalysts for UWMC, as well as positive analyst sentiment about long term prospects.

&amp;nbsp;

---



#Swing Play

Currently, there are two swing-play catalysts in effect for UWMC. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Catalyst #1)** 

It’s in the same sector as RKT. We all see what’s happening with that right now - It’s the entire reason I even thought of this play to begin with. As much as people try to deny it, certain “baskets” of stocks trade in relation to one another. This was most prominent during the GME squeeze. GME started ripping, and it started carrying other trash up with it, like AMC, NOK, BB, etc. The movement of these stocks seemed almost intertwined. GME ripped, and so did the other meme stocks. GME started drilling, and the rest followed suit. The exact same thing is happening in today's market environment. RKT is ripping, and it’s drawing attention to other mortgage and finance stocks, causing them to gap up as well. So long as RKT keeps ripping, the rest should follow suit, and since UWMC is so much closer to it’s floor (only up 20% compared to RKT’s 120%), it results in us being able to place a much safer bet. Luckily, this isn’t the only catalyst, which means that if RKT starts to go down, there may be a divergence among these equities, with UWMC continuing to trend upwards even after the RKT fiasco ends.

&amp;nbsp;

**Catalyst #2)** 

On the morning of March 1st, it was announced that UWMC will be added to the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indices. These inclusions almost always result in a price increase, due to the indices and index funds having to purchase shares for exposure. Furthermore, this also results in the future potential for UWMC to be added to the S&amp;P 500.

&amp;nbsp;

With the explosive growth of companies within the same sector, as well as index inclusion being right around the corner, UWMC seems like an extremely good candidate for a potential swing trade.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#Deep Value Play

From a strict fundamental perspective, UWMC is horribly undervalued. Many of the same principles /u/DeepFuckingValue uncovered in Gamestop are present in UWMC today. They have an incredible balance sheet, insane YoY growth, and fundamentally sound business prospects. These metrics include :

- A P/E ratio of 3.8, compared to the sectors average of 14.0
- Forward P/E of 6.11 compared to the sectors average of 11.0
- **Q4 2020 Net Income of $1.37 billion and FY2020 net income of $3.38 billion - An 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively**
- Q1 2021 expectations : 22.6% - 34.4% increase from Q1 2020
- 5% Dividend, coming up on March 9th
- High level of institutional ownership
- Short Interest of around 35-45%

&amp;nbsp;

UWMC absolutely brutalized their earnings, and are expected to continue dominating them well into the future. Smart money has loaded up on shares, and is waiting for liftoff. The current valuation of UWMC is criminal, and I can easily see this stock reaching into the high twenties over the course of the following year.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#Long Term Prospects

On top of the deep value play, UWMC is also poised for steady, long term growth. UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see a steady increase in EPS. This is starkly different from its peers, who are expected to experience the opposite - Most companies within the same sector are expected to have significantly worse years going forward, following the inevitable hike in interest rates, which UWMC actually looks forward to. Since UWMC is a mortgage lender, a hike in interest rates will result in an insane jump in profits for them as a company, leading to explosive growth. The company is poised for success even after the swing trades and value plays have run their course, and to me, that’s extremely bullish.

&amp;nbsp;

#Trading Strategies

Given that my thesis has convinced you, we arrive at the fun part of the article - the trading strategies. Overall, there are many ways to approach this trade, and I’ll lay them out in relation to the type of play one would want to make.

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re looking for a short term swing play, your best bet would likely be the April contracts at the $10 or $12.5 strikes. These options are trading dirt cheap, and if you believe that RKT and UWMC will continue to run in tandem with one another, these would prove to be an awesome pickup. These will likely be best to buy on or after March 10th, after the ex-dividend date, as stocks tend to drop post dividend. These contracts will give you exposure to the bullish runs within the mortgage sector, as well as the pre Russel index inclusion runup.

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re looking for a deep (fucking) value play, you could look to sell ATM cash secured puts on the underlying and pray for assignment. Alternatively, you could outright buy a boatload of shares and LEAPS (similar to what DFV did with GME back in June). Both would work just fine, and would let you capitalize on the value prospects of this play.

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re just looking for a nice stock to buy and hold, grab some shares, wait for the inevitable runup post Russel inclusion, and sell some covered calls once the premiums start to get jacked to the tits. You’ll amplify your returns, while reaping the benefits of organic stock appreciation.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#Bear Thesis

Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. Below, you can find a list of potential negatives related to UWMC, with respect to the various investing timelines discussed above.

&amp;nbsp;

**Swing**

- RKT can grind to a halt, killing all momentum within the sector, similar to how GME took out the other meme stocks when it popped.
- Russel inclusion doesn’t drive up the price nearly as much as anticipated, resulting in little change in the underlying's price.
- Stock and option pricing sometimes drops post dividend - pay close attention to March 9th.
- Although uncommon, the low float may result in potential manipulation from MMs.

&amp;nbsp;

**Deep Value**

- Mortgage industry faces potential insecurity, as the promise of 0% interest rates may be extended all the way until the end of 2022
- Mortgage companies are not “sexy”. In a market dominated by innovation and tech, investors may be reluctant to invest their money in a “boring mortgage company”.
- Insiders are allowed to sell in 6 months time. Luckily, the CEO of UWMC owns 90% of the company, and has been adamant that company will prove itself to be worth analyst's valuation of at least $14.50 - Take this with a grain of salt.

&amp;nbsp;

**Long Term Prospects**

- An upcoming market or housing crash could potentially result in this sector being hit harder than the others. This is an extremely unlikely scenario, as we will likely have far bigger problems than UWMC dropping 2$ back down to 7$, but still one to consider nonetheless.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Conclusion**

All in all, amidst the RKT madness, UWMC seems to provide us with an awesome trading opportunity. With different trades applicable to three distinct investing styles, UWMC offers the potential for everyone to make some coin. If you want to capitalize off of the RKT pump and index inclusion, you can look to swing trade with some cheap option contracts. If you’ve done your due diligence, and like what you see on UWMC’s balance sheet, you can take a deep value approach and mimic the methods of our king. Lastly, if you’re just a boring ass boomer, you can grab some shares and enjoy the gain train. If you enjoyed the DD, feel free to follow me on twitter, or join my investing discord.

I personally feel that we are I the late stage of a bull cycle now that so many retailer investors are coming out to play, although with corona it could be different. I estimate a major pull back in 2022-2023. After discussing the new picks and notable mentions, I'd like to go over a basic hedging strategy for anyone that is nervous.

$**PLTR**\- Not only has Ark Invest been buying up Palantir during the dip last week, so have I. I will continue dollar cost averaging into my call option positions (Aug 21, $30 Strike). I'll be keeping my entry and target the same.

$**WKHS**\- Workhorse Group is an EV manufacturer currently focused on manufacturing electrically powered delivery and utility vehicles. Recently $WKHS has dipped into and is near my 'Buy Zone'. With the Biden administration waiting to electrify all of the vehicles in the federal fleet, this company could be in a good situation to get a contract for USPS let's say. If that were to happen, there would be a buying frenzy. Since it is near my support, I'd like to be getting some mid - long term call options. I'll keep my target and entry the same on this one for now.

Hedge: 

**$DIA:** Let's look at far OTM Puts on Dow Jones ETF. For me, this is more of an 'insurance policy' than it is an actual hedge, but it is so cheap that its hard to not consider. At Jan 22 expiration, the $95 put is only $30 right now. Spending a couple hundred, or a thousand, dollars on these could make you a lot of money if the market did crash. The question is when will it have a significant correction. If it is before Jan 22, these premiums will skyrocket. In 2008, the Dow lost half of its value. If something like this happens again based on increased IV and the strike not as far OTM, I estimate these would 20-50x.  

https://preview.redd.it/493ja88dwxi61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81adc4079e1ff2cba082b7db4f95f49c9f34d343

For arguments sake, let's say the same thing happened this year as in 2008 and the Dow lost 50% of its value so $DIA dropped to $150. That puts our $95/$100 strike about $50 out of the money. Currently, $50 OTM is going for $1000. That is about 33x even with low IV of 25%. Assuming the IV would skyrocket if the markets were crashing and these puts would be in much higher demand, this could be higher.

If the market doesn't crash by Jan 22, you'll lose the money (some or all), but that is pretty much how 'insurance' works. 

Let me know if you agree or disagree with my cheap hedge.

Many people on the news and online are fear mongering about a crash soon to come. I personally feel that we are I the late stage of a bull cycle now that so many retailer investors are coming out to play, although with corona it could be different. I estimate a major pull back in 2022-2023. After discussing the new picks and notable mentions, I'd like to go over a basic hedging strategy for anyone that is nervous.

**Adding to Watchlist:** 

$**NIO**\- In case you have been living under a rock, NIO is a Chinese electric car company. They have the lead as far as Chinese electric luxury vehicles are concerned in China. Take it from someone that lives in Shanghai - they are everywhere. Personally, I like the interiors of these cars better than Tesla and I think this is easily an $85-$100 stock. Start buying into long positions now and the next EV push should pay you nicely. Deep ITM LEAPS?

If the markets pulled back this week a little bit, I would take that as a great chance to pick up some more long term positions. My portfolio is down 0.76%, or $5800, today.

I will be watching all of the ARK Invest funds as well as $QQQ for a possible entry into some LEAPS. I'd like to increase my exposure and seeing how they are down a little bit right now, it could be a good time to DCA into some long term positions.

Note: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest.

The neighborhood comic/nerd shop -- The Android Dungeon -- has a hologram Charizard card on sale for $1,000 (which, for the sake of this little allegory, is the market price). You can't afford it right now, but the owner will put it on hold for you until December if you pay a nonrefundable deposit of $100.  As with options, this contract is transferable -- you know a lot of fellow nerds you could sell it to -- and doesn't obligate you to buy the card.

Because you're thirsty for nerd cred, you start bragging that you own a holo Charizard, which is sorta kinda true.

Your obnoxious rival Melvin's eyes light up when he hears this. (He really, really wants these cards for some reason, but because he's such a jerk, nobody wants to sell to him.)

He offers you the $1,000 market price. (Here, his offer is just representing the open market, because I'm too lazy to write another character, Vary Geynerchuk, who is always willing to pay the market price because he's convinced that the collectibles market is going to rocket.)

You tell him ""GFY"" because A) you're convinced that the card's value is going to the moon (Vary told you so), B) your breakeven price (purchase price, plus $100 hold fee) is $1,100 so you'd be losing money selling it for $1,000, and C) you're vulgar and rude.

You do, however, offer to sell him the card for $1500. This is outrageous -- nobody thinks the card is going over $1250 this *year* \-- but you throw the number out so you can get rid of Melvin.

""Ugh, no,"" he says.

""Suit yourself,"" you say, secretly glad not to have to do business with Melvin, who smells of elderberries.

""Wait,"" he says, ""if that card goes over $1500, will you please, please sell it to me? I'll do things. Things you can only find on the dark web. Please, please, if it crosses $1500, sell it to me.""

""If it crosses $1,500, I can just sell it to Vary. Why should I sell it to *you*?""

""Please, like I said, I'll do things.  I'll even let you put--""

""Um, no. Let's just go with money. Pay me $20 -- that's nonrefundable, mind you -- and I'll sell it to you for $1,500. You get exclusive rights until...let's go with March 19. Third Friday of the month. That's not at all an arbitrary date.""

Melvin accepts.

Now, it feels weird to be writing contracts to sell something you don't actually own yet, but you know you can't actually lose any money on the deal.

If Holozard is worth $1,500 or more at close of business on March 19, Melvin'll pay you $1,500 (on top of the $20 he already paid you). You can take $1,000 of that, buy the card from The Android Dungeon, hand the card to Melvin, and pocket $400 profit (not to mention Melvin's initial $20). Maybe you'll buy yourself something in the style of a nice Groudon.

Heck, if the card is worth *exactly* $1,500 on the 19th, maybe you'll just buy a Holozard from Vary (who, for the purposes of this story is also always wiling to sell at exactly the market price), hand *that* to Melvin, and keep your original contract from The Android's Dungeon.

The only thing that gives you pause is Infinite Gain FOMO. What if Holozard -- and only Holozard -- is printed with a unique Japanese ink, derived from the blood of coronavirus-immune bats (the coronavirus immunity of course giving the blood and therefore the ink just that ""chef's kiss"" crimson) that cures Covid? The card would be worth billions, and here you are obligated to sell it to elderberry-smelling Melvin for $1,500, and all because you promised your parents never to commit the sin of murder, stealing from another human being the holy gift of life.  (Also, that you'd never, you know, simply break a contract.)

Put another way, it's, like, how high will the sycamore grow? If you cut it down, then you'll never know. And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon, for whether we are white- or copper-skinned, we need to sing with all the voices of the mountains -- we need to paint with all the colors of the wind.

Except Melvin would *own* the wind, and all because your astronomical-sounding price proved to actually be too low.

But the D20 is cast, and there's nothing you can do but wait.

On March 19th, Holozard tops out at $1,499, and you snap Melvin's $20 bill in his face and gloat that it's now yours, and you're going to put it on your nightstand next to your Holozard (which you kinda, sorta, theoretically own), and together President Jackson and Holozard will be the only witnesses to the interactions you'll be having with Melvin's mother.

Melvin sticks this in his spank bank and, business before pleasure, asks again to buy your Holozard -- same terms as last time.

You agree, but because your card is now worth nearly $1,500, you raise the asking price to $2,000 (along with another $20 for his exclusive purchase rights which'll expire on April 23 -- again, the absolutely-not-arbitrary third Friday of next month).

At the end of April 23, the card is worth $1,999, and you smugly place Melvin's second $20 on top of the first.

This series of events happens over and over, and by November, you have a fat stack of eight -- count them, **eight** \-- $20 bills. Baller.

Also, Holozard is now worth $5,499 which is pretty crazy. I mean, who's he think he is? Blastoise?

So, next month your 100% transferable contract with The Android's Dungeon is coming due.  You earned $160 from Melvin, but spent so much time with his mother making sweet, sweet but non-cash-accruing labor that you don't have the $1,000 to buy the card from the shop.

Partly because you don't have the cash -- truth is, until you started milking Melvin for cash, you never had more free cash than the initial $100 to buy the ""hold"" contract -- and partly because word on the street is that Comic Book Guy will literally murder you when you come to buy his $5,499 card for $1,000, you decide to exercise the transferability of the Android Dungeon contract and sell it to Melvin. (Seriously, how GD sweet would it be if Comic Book Guy killed Melvin?)

""Here,"" you say, holding the contract out to Melvin, ""you can buy the card from the comic book shop for $1,000.""

""How much do you want for it?"" Melvin asks a little suspiciously.

""Five big ones,"" you say.

""Wait, I don't think I can handle that.  I mean, there's my mouth, both hands, and then all that's left--""

""Ew, no. I meant five thousand dollars.""

""Oh. Well, that's better.  Wait, why should I pay $5,000 for this?""

""Because Holozard is clearly going to be worth $6,000 by the end of December. I mean, look at the inexplicably linear progression of its valuation.  So, you pay me $5,000 for the contract, pay Comic Book Guy $1,000 for the actual card, and then (because the guy writing this is clearly not  bothering with intrinsic and extrinsic value, and implied volatility, are you out of your GD mind?) in total, you paid $6,000 for a $6,000 card. Easy peasey.""

""So you're making $4,900 off this contract that cost you $100?""

""Don't forget the $160 you paid me this year.""

""I hate you.""

""Not as much as everybody hates you.""

**$BIDU:** Baidu is basically the Google of China. There is a rumor I've recently come across that $BIDU reportedly aims to address chip shortage plaguing the gaming, crypto and car industries. The are considering setting up a dedicated subsidiary backed by crypto-friendly venture capital firms. There is a global chip shortage, partly fueled by the rise of BTC and partly by Covid-19 uptick of gaming. Baidu has a strong grasp on their market in China; they aren't going anywhere, so even if the rumor falls short, it is still not a bad hold. I'd b interested in mid term calls.

**BLDP:** Ballard Power is a developer and manufacturer of proton exchange membrane fuel cell products for markets such as heavy-duty motive, portable power, material handling as well as engineering services. A day ago, they launched a $350M bought deal offering at $37a share which was $3 under the market price at that time. This caused the price to drop 13% today. If you take a look at the chart, it looks like $BLDP could stand to drop another 5-10% and fill the gap from January. I'd set that as a buy zone to pick up cheap shares, or mid-long term options. Overall, this company is set to have continued growth, and I think this sell off is temporary.

**Notable Mentions:**

**$ELY:** Looks like earnings came up short and Callaway has entered our 'Buy Zone'. Here is the chart from a couple days ago when we first wrote about it. (you can go back and see our past write up on $ELY)

I see some people thinking it is not a good buy anymore, but when I first drew the 'Buy Zone' I believed then that it would hit it and is a good buy at those levels. My opinion on $ELY hasn't changed. Congrats to anyone that picked some ELY up.

**$FUTU:** Another one that we called correctly from yesterday's write up report. It was up 9% today overall, but right after opening bell, you could have taken profits at around $204. I'll keep watching this one to pull back further into the 'Buy Zone'. 

&amp;#x200B;

**$ARKK/$ARKG:** Like stated above, the ARK ETF's are on sale today. Usually when that happens, I will add money to these positions in some way.

Most notably, the ARK Invest ETF's pulled back with K, G and Q more than 1%.

Positions filled, including closing for profit/loss. $IPOD was the only one I closed for a loss of $110. I'll reevaluate that one later. Remember, the higher the risk, the smaller the position should be.

**Adding to Watchlist:**

**$BIDU:** Baidu is basically the Google of China. There is a rumor I've recently come across that $BIDU reportedly aims to address chip shortage plaguing the gaming, crypto and car industries. The are considering setting up a dedicated subsidiary backed by crypto-friendly venture capital firms. There is a global chip shortage, partly fueled by the rise of BTC and partly by Covid-19 uptick of gaming. Baidu has a strong grasp on their market in China; they aren't going anywhere, so even if the rumor falls short, it is still not a bad hold. I'd b interested in mid term calls.

**BLDP:** Ballard Power is a developer and manufacturer of proton exchange membrane fuel cell products for markets such as heavy-duty motive, portable power, material handling as well as engineering services. A day ago, they launched a $350M bought deal offering at $37a share which was $3 under the market price at that time. This caused the price to drop 13% today. If you take a look at the chart, it looks like $BLDP could stand to drop another 5-10% and fill the gap from January. I'd set that as a buy zone to pick up cheap shares, or mid-long term options. Overall, this company is set to have continued growth, and I think this sell off is temporary.

NoKidCouple76,0.0,432.0,"Hi all, 
I’m not sure if this type of post is allowed, so please delete if necessary. I could use some support and guidance, after what feels like a devastating few weeks. 

Just a few weeks ago, before this chop, I was flying high as I’m sure many others were. I had accumulated some healthy options winnings, over the last several weeks and felt like I was in a good place to hold my ITM calls with May DTEs. I was strategic about my buys, and many were very much green. Some 100%+. 

The first red day sucked, but I told myself it was a healthy pullback. Buy the dip is a common mantra and it’s what i did. And here’s where I just don’t understand what the hell happened to me. Red days started piling up and I just held. Telling myself that the rebound was around the corner and I had until May, July, and Jan 2022. Convincing myself that the worst was behind us. 3 red days turned into 4, 5, and the next thing I know I’m down all my gains. You’d think I’d sell right? No fucking way. A slew of monster green days was just around the corner. Finally, after last Friday I sold all of my May calls, and held my July and Jan 2022 calls. Both red now... (ARKK 1/22 $97c -$50 &amp;amp;amp; ARKG 7/16 $94c -$3,699) My ARKK I was up $2k now down $50, my ARKG I was up $500 and now down almost $3700. Since ARKG has a few months left, I feel like I have to give them more time, but this is fucking stupid I know...

So here I sit, lost all of my gains. I’m -25% overall on my account. My wife doesn’t know, and I want to scream. It’s like I just sat back and watched as the world burned and did nothing about it. Which is weird since I normally respect my stops.

Those of you who blew up your accounts, how did you get back on the horse? How did you handle the humiliation? I know I need to take a step back, but I’m still holding these stupid call options. Someone please kick me in the ass. 

Thanks for listening.

Edit: thanks everyone for the advice and encouraging words. I truly appreciate it. I realize I’m handling this like a little bitch, but it stings and there’s some value in community and sharing. Especially during these times of isolation. This situation will certainly lead to some self-reflection of my own human faults. My emotional relationship and emotions around money, my inaction during times of distress, fallacies and biases that cloud my judgement and decision making, and my overall emotional state when things are stressful in the market all require some in-depth analysis. All I know is that I can’t and won’t quit. I’ve come too far to just give up. I will step back for a few days/weeks and develop a strategy to recoup my losses. Whether it’s selling theta or just holding boomer commons, I’ll figure this shit out. Someway somehow. Thanks again ✌🏼",1,How did you pick yourself up?,432.0,0.94,"How did you pick yourself up?

Capt_Doge,0.0,432.0,"tl:dr; [https://www.graphvega.com/](https://www.graphvega.com/) is an open sourced platform for visualizing options trades.

Hey everyone,

After diving into options and spending some time on reddit, I noticed how most people (especially the folks down at algotrading) love to create their own tools for their trades. Though options profit calculators exist, non of them were open sourced and thus they didn't allow anyone to build custom functionality/features that helps their specific trading style. So I decided to build this as a project to fill this need (and for fun too!).

It can analyze the P/L of an options position with variation in the stock price under changes in volatility and days till expiry. Additionally, you can add shares of the underlying as well, so you can better analyze positions that have shares in them too.

Some features I hope to add over time are charts for the greeks of the options position when volatility/days till expiry changes and amount of underlying required at each price to hedge delta.

Here's a gif of it in action:

Hope you guys find it useful! I've got to say, it was pretty fun to make this over the winter break. It improved my understanding of options, especially when I tested it on many different looking options positions to see how it behaves. I would love to hear your thoughts/feedback about the app!

TonyLiberty,0.0,388.0," Some of you may know me from my Due Diligence posts at [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/).  Posting this because it's very volatile &amp; lucrative to trade options on. I'll share my due diligence with you all:

&amp;#x200B;

**My strategy:**

I am long on this, and I am also writing covered call options on my shares, to raise more money. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember:**

1. NASDAQ compliance to maintain its listing is done
2. $600m in cash was raised, and the company has no-debt. On Feb. 2, it closed a new registered offering worth approximately $100 million (less underwriting discounts and offering expenses). In other words, management has an influx of cash to drive new growth. That's a huge improvement compared to a year ago, and worth paying attention to: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us100-million-registered-offering-301220098.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us100-million-registered-offering-301220098.html)
3. A long-term reason for this stock is the broader acceptance of marijuana use and expectations for further legalization or decriminalization, particularly at the federal level under President Joe Biden.  And should the U.S. legalize marijuana in the coming years, Sundial could find itself in a position to aggressively enter this potentially massive market:   [https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/state-and-regional/marijuana-legalization-bill-inches-closer-to-approval-in-nj-after-long-wait/article\_dc60e314-446c-5ca3-a34c-671dcd0a1b19.html](https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/state-and-regional/marijuana-legalization-bill-inches-closer-to-approval-in-nj-after-long-wait/article_dc60e314-446c-5ca3-a34c-671dcd0a1b19.html)

&amp;#x200B;

**You should know:**

The inquiries and google searches for SNDL has decreased a lot. I interpret this as less people are as interested as before:

**Prediction:**

Negatives &amp; positives both weighted,

I think the Pot Stocks Jump again due to built up anticipation buying.

Right now $SNDL is still trending so much, that another spike and sell-off are inevitable

$SNDL may explode when the stimulus checks are signed (late February) due to robinhooders &amp; the reddit effect (and it being a penny stock)

&amp;#x200B;

**Speculation:**

$SNDL raised $600m in cash raised with no-debt. They can enter the US market ( though a merger/ acquisition) when marijuana legalizes , and they could find itself in a position to aggressively enter this potentially massive market.

They have a lot of cash raised and no debt which means tons of room for growth and expansion. Until recently, $SNDL was one of the lesser-known publicly traded cannabis cultivators. Now, after attracting the attention of a swarm of Reddit and Robinhood traders, the company's stock is growing explosively. In fact, its growth was so extreme that Robinhood limited purchases of the stock on January 28 for several days, though the restrictions have since been lifted.

DEEP DIVE &amp; ANALYSIS. [UPDATED: Sundial Growers] BOTH Good &amp; Bad Since it's trending  Some of you may know me from my Due Diligence posts at [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/).  Posting this because it's very volatile &amp; lucrative to trade options on. I'll share my due diligence with you all:

&amp;#x200B;

**My strategy:**

I am long on this, and I am also writing covered call options on my shares, to raise more money. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember:**

1. NASDAQ compliance to maintain its listing is done
2. $600m in cash was raised, and the company has no-debt. On Feb. 2, it closed a new registered offering worth approximately $100 million (less underwriting discounts and offering expenses). In other words, management has an influx of cash to drive new growth. That's a huge improvement compared to a year ago, and worth paying attention to: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us100-million-registered-offering-301220098.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us100-million-registered-offering-301220098.html)
3. A long-term reason for this stock is the broader acceptance of marijuana use and expectations for further legalization or decriminalization, particularly at the federal level under President Joe Biden.  And should the U.S. legalize marijuana in the coming years, Sundial could find itself in a position to aggressively enter this potentially massive market:   [https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/state-and-regional/marijuana-legalization-bill-inches-closer-to-approval-in-nj-after-long-wait/article\_dc60e314-446c-5ca3-a34c-671dcd0a1b19.html](https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/state-and-regional/marijuana-legalization-bill-inches-closer-to-approval-in-nj-after-long-wait/article_dc60e314-446c-5ca3-a34c-671dcd0a1b19.html)

The inquiries and google searches for SNDL has decreased a lot. I interpret this as less people are as interested as before:

cclagator,0.0,435.0,"**Market Volatility**

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **2%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $376 to the downside and $392 on the upside. The Nasdaq and Russell saw wild swings last week and options are pricing larger moves for this week than SPY:

**QQQ 2.9%**  
**IWM 3.3%**

The VIX got near 32 on Thursday and closed below 25 on Friday after that monster rally back. Implied volatility in the big ETFs can sometimes have a hard time pricing two-way movement like last week. The indices were practically unchanged on the week but were seeing intraday moves larger than what options were pricing for the entire week. The VIX collapsed on Friday on that rally but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. In other words, if one is trading pure IV out a month or more those changes in VIX are tradeable. If one is trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... where the VIX or individual stock IV is at entry is less important.

**Tesla** is an interesting name right now as it's sort of representative of the selling going on in recent high flyers. Even with the rally Friday afternoon in the major indices TSLA closed down on the day by 4%. Here's a look at TSLA's expected move over the next few weeks via Options AI:

A note on expected moves. Options need to price in both the overall market volatility and the earnings event itself. So a company reporting on Monday still has a few days for the stock to move after earnings and before expiration, while companies reporting on Thursday can move with the market before they report. The percentage moves will be roughly the same barring huge moves in market IV, but obviously what the percentage moves correspond to in the stock will change depending on where the stock is into its event.

The expected move is extremely useful not only to get a sense of how the crowd is pricing moves but also on strike selection in any option strategy. An oversimplified way to think of it is that if you own premium with a breakeven beyond the stock's expected move you need the options market to have underpriced the move, even if you get the direction correct. And if you are a net seller of premium you want the options market to be overpricing these moves, especially if you get the direction wrong.",1,"Expected moves for the week.

cclagator,0.0,367.0,"A quick roundup of expected moves via the options market for this week. Expected moves are useful for spotting opportunity or managing risk but they are also important for trade strategies in options themselves, for instance with strike selection. I'll start with SPY, also check in on Gamestop, before looking at companies reporting earnings this week. With the earnings stocks, I've included their prior earnings actual moves for comparison. 

In case I missed something you're tracking, a searchable list with the expected move and prior earnings moves can be found on the Options AI calendar. Here's an example in [Zoom ZM](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ZM). Feel free to bookmark and use that, it's free. These moves are based on Friday's closing prices in options and will look slightly different on the open tomorrow.

**SPY** \- With the VIX around 28, SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move this week:

https://preview.redd.it/ta8tah3ijak61.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff01c63d3ee2c1c4341ea39f17d614b3be4218bc

**Gamestop GME** is kind of wild (as you know), but what's really wild is that it reports earnings later this month and has a 75% expected move for the month, but it ain't because of earnings, no one cares about that. Its expected move for this week alone is 45%. In other words, it's all about the weekly options and retail demand for not so cheap upside calls:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zb5cdzqyjak61.gif

Speaking of Gamestop, I wrote again last week about how nuts the options are and that they're practically giving away call spreads when compared to out-of-the-money calls. Also, how directional butterflies can be used for bearish positioning, as implied volatility usually gets killed in these stocks as they go lower and out of the money puts can get crushed even while getting the direction right. Worth a read if you're involved in Gamestop or any similar stocks, the article is on LEARN [here](https://learn.optionsai.com/gamestop-and-high-volatility-options/) and is very similar to a post I wrote on r/options a few weeks ago. You heard it here first :)

\-CC",1,"Expected moves for the week, SPY, Zoom, NIO, Snowflake, Slack and more.",367.0,0.95,"Expected moves for the week, SPY, Zoom, NIO, Snowflake, Slack and more. A quick roundup of expected moves via the options market for this week. Expected moves are useful for spotting opportunity or managing risk but they are also important for trade strategies in options themselves, for instance with strike selection. I'll start with SPY, also check in on Gamestop, before looking at companies reporting earnings this week. With the earnings stocks, I've included their prior earnings actual moves for comparison. 

In case I missed something you're tracking, a searchable list with the expected move and prior earnings moves can be found on the Options AI calendar. Here's an example in [Zoom ZM](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ZM). Feel free to bookmark and use that, it's free. These moves are based on Friday's closing prices in options and will look slightly different on the open tomorrow.

**SPY** \- With the VIX around 28, SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move this week:

**Gamestop GME** is kind of wild (as you know), but what's really wild is that it reports earnings later this month and has a 75% expected move for the month, but it ain't because of earnings, no one cares about that. Its expected move for this week alone is 45%. In other words, it's all about the weekly options and retail demand for not so cheap upside calls:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zb5cdzqyjak61.gif

Speaking of Gamestop, I wrote again last week about how nuts the options are and that they're practically giving away call spreads when compared to out-of-the-money calls. Also, how directional butterflies can be used for bearish positioning, as implied volatility usually gets killed in these stocks as they go lower and out of the money puts can get crushed even while getting the direction right. Worth a read if you're involved in Gamestop or any similar stocks, the article is on LEARN [here](https://learn.optionsai.com/gamestop-and-high-volatility-options/) and is very similar to a post I wrote on r/options a few weeks ago. You heard it here first :)

FluxRevived,0.0,361.0,"What's going on everyone? I initially wrote this for WSB, and was recommended to post it here. Let me know what you think! That being said, please excuse the vulgar language and memes. I tried to edit most of it out, but if some has slipped through the cracks from my initial draft, I apologize. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is going to be my first attempt at writing DD in my entire life, so please, give it a read and let me know what you all think! I've attached a TLDR at the bottom for those who are a little short on time, and a TLDR of the TLDR for those who came from WSB. All that being said, lets begin!

&amp;nbsp;


**__Background__**

What initially caught my eye about this entire play, was the [large influx of OTM call options being purchased for AT&amp;T at the 30C and 30.5C strikes, dated for 03/05](https://imgur.com/vZLHCJ6). These contracts started popping up at the start of the month, and then exploded February 10th and 11th. What makes these calls so odd is the nature of AT&amp;T; It's a boomer dividend stock. It experiences little to no volatility. It's a behemoth with an insanely large market cap. $T is extremely resilient to big moves, so why are so many options contracts so far OTM (*in relation to T*) being gobbled up? Someone with a deep pockets, and potentially a crystal ball, is betting insane amounts of money on $T to go above $30.5 (a roughly 6% increase at the time of writing) within the next three weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

I had a few theories as to what may be going on, but was ultimately unsure of what to make of these unusual flows, so I decided to keep it at the back of my mind, and start to look for answers.

&amp;nbsp;

**__Catalyst #1 : AST SpaceMobile__**

To those who don't know, SpaceMobile is the first and only space-based cellular broadband network able to be accessible by standard smartphones. SpaceMobile will effectively be able to provide both 4G and 5G connectivity to your phone ANYWHERE on the planet. AT&amp;T has been in talks with AST about using their satellite network to provide 5G to their users, which I think is pretty nifty. Nothing has been confirmed yet, however, an FCC filing over the summer hinted at a commercial agreement. AST says that they plan on providing North American coverage for AT&amp;T as early as ""Phase 2"" of their satellite launch. Overall, I think this is a pretty awesome deal, as the technology ensures that all AT&amp;T cellular dead zones in North America would be effectively eliminated, making AT&amp;T more attractive than it’s competitors in the consumer cell phone market. Could this warrant a jump in price? Absolutely.

&amp;nbsp;

**__Catalyst #2 : 5G Airwave Auction__**

Every time someone accesses the internet through their smartphone, their wireless carrier transmits that data through the airwaves on frequencies that *only it* has the license to use. Currently, there is an active auction (Auction 107) for air-wave licenses within the 5G spectrum band that has netted a record grand total of $81 billion dollars from various big players in the industry, such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, etc. Bidding concluded on Friday, January 15th, with winning bidders having the opportunity to further bid for frequency-specific licenses in the assignment phase, which began on Monday, February 8, 2021. The larger the portion of 5G spectrum a company acquires, the better situated they'll be when 5G becomes the new normal standard among consumers. The performance jump from 5G is going to be so dramatic, that if carriers are not in that game they’re going to get left behind. On January 31st, it was revealed that once the assignment phase is completed in the *coming weeks*, the winners will be announced. Coincidentally, this lines up right before the expiration of these options, leading me to believe the call buyer(s) could be betting that AT&amp;T won a large slice of the spectrum, easily warranting the needed 6% jump.

&amp;nbsp;

**__Catalyst #3 : PLTR Partnership__**

Here is where things start to get a little spicy. It is rumored that PLTR and AT&amp;T have signed a partnership agreement. As asinine as it sounds, these claims are easily backed up. PLTR and AT&amp;T seem to have been in talks about collaborating for a bit, [as leaked by an employee on LinkedIn](https://i.redd.it/of9onix9izg61.png). The employee alludes to the fact that he was a key person in getting PLTR approved by the AT&amp;T chief data office, with the timing and duration of his position reinforcing the fact that the contract is still fairly new. Furthermore, there have been a large magnitude of job postings from AT&amp;T in Texas, that had PLTR as a high preferred / necessary qualification. This brings us to out next lead.

&amp;nbsp;

Luxoft, a large Digital Strategy Consulting firm, has a newly posted Data Analyst role in Plano, Texas. [Some key takeaways from the posting](https://www.dice.com/jobs/detail/data-analyst-luxoft-usa-inc-plano-tx-75023/newageny/6846840) :

&amp;nbsp;

• Our client is looking to Luxoft for help to scale the deployment timeline of a network ticketing and orchestration system into **five new centers**.

• This person would analyze Network operations center data via PowerBI and on the **Palantir platform**.

• Under ""Mandatory"" skills, there's **""Worked in Palantir or other big data analytics platforms""**

• Under ""Nice-to-have"" skills, there's **"" Experience in telecommunication industry""**

&amp;nbsp;

So we know that Luxoft wants someone with PLTR experience, to scale and deploy some form of network into five new centres, in Plano, Texas. If we go to the Plano Economic Development website, [we find an incredibly important article](https://www.planotexas.org/269/ATT-launches-new-innovation-center-in-Pl). The key takeaway from it, is that :

&amp;nbsp;

• ""**AT&amp;T announced plans to open new innovation centers in Atlanta and Plano, Texas, to open in coming months, giving it a total of five such centers worldwide**""

&amp;nbsp;

As a result, we can conclude that the undisclosed Luxoft client is AT&amp;T, and that the new system they are looking to deploy across five new centers are the new AT&amp;T innovation centers, the first of which is the one located in Plano, Texas, where all of the hiring is taking place. To top it all off, there was a recently posted position at AT&amp;T, looking for people for their Professional [Advanced Analytics - Operations Transformation program, located in Plano, Texas](https://www.att.jobs/job/plano/professional-advanced-analytics-operations-transformation/117/18772894).

&amp;nbsp;

Given Palantir’s meme power, and excitement for the future, a partnership could provide very beneficial to both companies, resulting in a swift upward trajectory to AT&amp;Ts underlying price as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**__Bearish Counterpoints__**

AT&amp;T is under a mountain of debt (The most of any publicly traded company), and they're losing subscribers from DirectTV and cable faster than they projected, further adding to this issue. At the same time, for them to keep up with 5G, they're to pay additional billions in a spectrum auction and then need to pay many billions more to roll out 5G. From a financial standpoint, this is a massive red-flag, but with interest-rates still at 0, it is unlikely do be an immediate issue, especially with the shorter dated March contracts. Another thing to consider is that AT&amp;T is a behemoth of a company. It's been trading in the 28$-30$ range since the dawn of time. PLTR Partnering with T may very well be akin to a fly landing on an aircraft carrier. Although its everyone's favorite meme stock with a promising future, the partnership may ultimately end up being negligible in the movement of AT&amp;T's stock price. The same could be said for any of the above catalysts, so please, proceed with caution.

&amp;nbsp;

**__Conclusion__**

With such a large number of potential catalysts, combined with the extremely cheap price of the contracts (10$ a pop at the time of writing), I feel like this offer is a little too good to pass up. Best case scenario, you hit a multi-bagger. Worst case scenario, you don't buy Wendy's for lunch on Wednesday and vow never to touch boomer stocks. I hope you all enjoyed this comprehensive DD on the unusual options flow of AT&amp;T. If you would like to follow me for future DD, you can either DM me, or find my socials linked below in the comments, or on my profile :)

&amp;nbsp;

**__TLDR__**

AT&amp;T has been experiencing some insanely large magnitudes of unusual options flow. Whales are gobbling up $T 2021-03-05 C $30 and $30.5 like candy. This is likely due to them having insider information regarding one of the potential catalysts. AT&amp;T  either partnered with AST SpaceMobile to eliminate cellular dead zones in their network, won the bidding war and managed to gain a favorable monopoly on the 5G airwave infrastructure, or partnered with none other than PLTR for an upcoming super project.

&amp;nbsp;

**__TLDR of TLDR__**

Hey everyone, Flux here! I initially wrote this thesis for WSB, but people from other subs seem to enjoy my posts, so I'm sprinkling it around! I want to apologize in advance for any the vulgar language and memes which slipped through the cracks. Most of it has been edited out, but if there's still some left, I apologize.

#**Introduction**

What’s poppin’ fellas? Ape gang professor Flux here with another heater post. You may know me from my AT&amp;T DD post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin, or from my Hut 8 DD post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage. 

&amp;nbsp;

Today, we’re going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades, by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends. This will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker, AMD. **To all you illiterate, paint-huffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don’t like learning, I’ve attached a TLDR at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money**. Let’s get to it!

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Building The Foundation**
To begin, let’s take a look at the [AMD one day chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X5hkIw6s/), and see if we notice anything odd, or unusual.

Do you see anything in particular? Does anything jump out at you? No? [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1DzmPafE/)

Still nothing? If you still don't notice anything, that’s fine, these patterns can be difficult to spot initially. [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uHY32HCB/)

As you can see from the final chart, for the past year, AMD has traded within very tight, specific ranges. I have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes. As we can tell; 

&amp;nbsp;

- **Box #1)** Starting from mid February to mid April, AMD traded within a 10$ range, between $39 and $49. It started at 49$, went down to 39$, back up to 49$, down to 40$, before once again going back up to 49$, where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range, creating a new range.
- **Box #2)** Now, starting from mid April, going all the way until earnings in August, AMD traded within a 10$ range **again**, between $49 and $59. This range was extremely tight and pronounced, bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel **seven** times throughout its lifetime, before smashing through the top of the channel again.
- **Box #3)** August through December. $74 to 87$ channel. This range was slightly messier, but still pronounced nonetheless. 6 clean bounces. Smash through the top into our new range.
- **Box #4)** This is where our most recent range lies, with an $85 bottom and a 95$ top. We haven’t surged out of this range in either direction, so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range. **How can we use this information to our advantage?**

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Applying our Knowledge**

To summarize our findings from above, for the past year, AMD has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer, higher range. These ranges have held and contained **27 different bounces without breaking**. Only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range, but it recovered within hours. **Twenty seven times, this thesis has held true, so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th**?

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, I assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage. We know that AMD trades within a tight range. We know that we are currently within the $85-$95 range. We coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85$. As a result, we know that it is **extremely** likely that a bounce off of $85 is going to take place.

&amp;nbsp;

Since we know that $85 is likely a bottom, and a bounce is likely going to take place, we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money. Personally, I picked up some 03/19 90Cs, as well as some 04/16 95Cs. And just like that, we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade, and have the opportunity to make some free money. We can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Extending our Knowledge**

Since we know we are trading in a channel, we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades! We know that the closer we get to $95, the more likely it is that we will bounce, so we can plan accordingly! Personally, with my 90C, I will look to set a stop loss when AMD is trading around 90$, and manually sell out of the position if AMD manages to break $92/$93.

&amp;nbsp;

Even though I’m a perma bull, I also trade the flipside of the channel as well. If I see AMD trading at $95+, I’ll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down. In this case, I set my stops a little tighter, and keep a greater watch over the trade, since we all know that stocks always go up. Furthermore, since every single channel ended with a blow off top, I don’t want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless. I would rather be conscientious beforehand, and manage my risks accordingly.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Conclusion**

As you can tell, we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart. Although the AMD example was painfully simple, it’s also painfully effective. The best part about all this is, that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market, simply waiting to be discovered. I hope you all learned something new today, and had fun while doing so. If you guys want to check out my other DDs, or follow me on my socials, they can all be found on my profile (Discord saw this DD first!). I love you all, and wish lots tendies upon each and every one of you :)

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR**

- Buy **$AMD 2021-03-19 C $90** and **$AMD 2021-04-16 C $95**

---

&amp;nbsp;

**2/23 Update** - AMD held $84.50 on this brutal red day, and stayed within the channel (wow! shocker!). I am extremely confident this is the bottom. Feel free to scale your positions in and get some tendies!",1,$AMD - Stealing from Market Makers - AMD Swing Trade Thesis,357.0,0.94,"$AMD - Stealing from Market Makers - AMD Swing Trade Thesis **__$AMD - Stealing from Market Makers - AMD Swing Trade Thesis__**

regnull,0.0,341.0,"I've been trading options for a little while (both buying and selling), and I was trying to understand what is the best way to evaluate implied volatility of a given stock. I know that IV rank is generally used for this, giving you a good idea of where the IV is in relation to the IV range. I think this does not give you the complete picture though - it doesn't reflect the relation between IV and the historical volatility. 

Anyway, I've been using this homegrown indicator I wrote in Thinkscript to show you the IV/HV ratio in three time frames with moderate success. Low IV/HV ratio (below 1) might indicate that the options are cheap, because the market thinks the underlying will move less than it did in the past. High ratios (above 1) might indicate that the options are expensive, more expensive than the past price movements suggest.

1) **FSLY** \- Fell from 10 day high of about $120 to the $81 current price sitting very nicely on the 200 SMA and beyond below the 2SD Bollinger point. I believe that the counter is quite oversold and will be adopting a bullish strategy for this. 

* Trade: When market opens on Monday (taking into account how pre-market fares), would enter a Bull Put Spread at 70/65, 19 Mar DTE.
* **Max Profit/Loss = $100/$400, ROI 25%.** 
* Probability of winning (generated by TOS, based on current prices) = 75%.

Why not do a Bull Call since I'm bullish? Well if I were to be wrong, I have some room for error (up to an $11 slide, 81-70).

**$CLII** \- Climate Change Crisis Real Impact Acq Corp is another SPAC charging station play similar to $SBE, that we discussed. They are suppose to be merging with EVgo. The EVgo and CLII merger deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. The merger is subject to approval from CLII’s shareholders and other customary closing conditions - which is why $SBE price sold off on news of a delay in sharing holder voting. Of course, with all SPACs we need to be careful; a lot is based on rumors and conjecture. Holding commons, I believe, is the best strategy here.

**$NET -** Also making its rounds on the net recently (pun intended) is Cloudfare. $NET is a web infrastructure and security company. There isn't really a surprise that this is a triple digit stock due to the rapidly growing demand of these services and that Cloudfare is among the leaders in its industry. I'd be interested in mid-long term calls.

    Just know that I have made these ***write ups*** for you. 

Last week ended well, which was a surprise that the markets didn't sell off coming up to the long weekend. It was one of those weeks where you can have a pleasant weekend without worrying about your positions to much, that is always the goal. Monday is Presidents Day (Happy P Day?) and the stock market is closed. I will resume my trading on Tuesday at opening bell as well as posting these daily write ups.

**$CLII** \- Climate Change Crisis Real Impact Acq Corp is another SPAC charging station play similar to $SBE, that we discussed. They are suppose to be merging with EVgo. The EVgo and CLII merger deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. The merger is subject to approval from CLII’s shareholders and other customary closing conditions - which is why $SBE price sold off on news of a delay in sharing holder voting. Of course, with all SPACs we need to be careful; a lot is based on rumors and conjecture. Holding commons, I believe, is the best strategy here.

**$NXE -** NexGen Energy Ltd. NexGen Energy Ltd. engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of uranium properties. There is a growing deficit of Uranium, and by no surprise to me stocks like these have soared in the past weeks. I don't see any stop to that either.

**$TSLA:** Tesla has dipped to interesting buying levels for myself. I already hold 100 shares that I sell covered calls on, but I'm thinking of increasing my exposure through either LEAPS or just buying $ARKK. Recently watching an interview with Cathie Woods, CEO of Ark Invest, increasing her position and it got me thinking. With the long range Model Y coming out soon, a possible Model 2 priced at $25,000 in the future, the Tesla autonomous semi's going to start rolling out, and the race for ridesharing and robotaxis I don't see any reason not to be bullish on Tesla. Once the $25,000 price point electric sedan does launch in China, the sales will be through the roof. Take it from someone that live in Shanghai for a decade - I see a Model 3 every 15 seconds drive by (it seems like). Not to mention that Tesla seems to be entering the Indian market as well and has just made $700M investing in $BTC. Again, all of these things put together and add up to a much higher $TSLA. I'm making a case for a $1350 EOY $TSLA.

**Adding to Watchlist:**

**$CLOV:** Clover Health Group has recently been under investigation for potential securities fraud claims on behalf of shareholders, resulting from allegations that Clover might have issued misleading information to the investing public. That was on February the 4th and now it seems to be slowly climbing back up. Since I like to get good deals on stocks, and sometimes these ""investigations"" are overreaction or even instigated by short sellers, they can provide good buying opportunities for us retailers.

**$SPCE:** Virgin Galactic provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. As of recent, it feels like we have entered a new space age, or race. Especially with Elon Musk and his SpaceX garnering a lot of attention, almost anything space related is doing well. I feel as if this one is over bought solely based on a lot of hype and possibly fear of missing out (FOMO). I'll be waiting for a correction, but if it corrects, I'll pick up some LEAPS most likely.

**$FUTU:** Futu Holdings is an investment holding company engaged in offering digitized brokerage platforms, most notably MooMoo.com. This one keeps coming across my radar, so I check out MooMoo's mobile and desktop app. They offer free lvl 2 data, decent margin rates, and access to invest in Hong Kong and Chinese stocks (very interesting for me). The mobile app is nice, but the desktop app is very laggy for me as of now. Nevertheless, $FUTU keeps on pushing up. If they improve the desktop version, I might start trading a little bit there. Also, I think they should rebrand. MooMoo is a strange name although I see they are going for a bull or cow noise. Its a Chinese company and in Chinese the word 'niu' for bull and cow are often interchangeable. It is to expensive for me now, but I'll be watching it closely.

**Notable Mentions:**

**$PLTR:** Palantir back at it again. I get a lot of questions regarding this one. Is it technically a meme stock? Do you remember when I first wrote about it? 

https://preview.redd.it/o86334hmakg61.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40e2b574a287ef9551cf223d04d9b44c13c5db44

 And this is as of today:

It almost was exactly what I thought with my green/red arrows! Right now, I might sell a put and hope to get assigned at a cheaper price. Other than that, it is pushing toward the first level of targets so I'll keep watching it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**$AAPL:** Currently I have the April 16th $150 calls; they are down. If $AAPL continues at its current slope of support, it should intersect with my BEP (break even price) exactly on the expiration date.  

https://preview.redd.it/azse284takg61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508c0a902d32c89a99bf1ae15fc8e81691d9d3d7

 A more realistic hypothetical prediction:

So if this does play out the way I hope, I'd take profit in the yellow circle. Let's just see how it plays out in the next few days. If you are looking to get into this one, I'd say give it a couple extra months to play it more conservative than I have. If you are already in it with me, we might roll it out in the future. 

Also, I picked up some AAPL LEAPS deep ITM at $120 with a delta of 70 today.

I ended up putting in a lot of limit orders for options today. Here are the ones that didn't fill.

Here are the ones that did fill, including selling to close for profit more than one. Usually I dollar cost average taking profit, so I still have contracts left over for a lotto push. Picked up some AAPL LEAPS, DKNG possible lottos, and closed the BABA before Jack disappears again.

**Adding to Watchlist:**

**$CLOV:** Clover Health Group has recently been under investigation for potential securities fraud claims on behalf of shareholders, resulting from allegations that Clover might have issued misleading information to the investing public. That was on February the 4th and now it seems to be slowly climbing back up. Since I like to get good deals on stocks, and sometimes these ""investigations"" are overreaction or even instigated by short sellers, they can provide good buying opportunities for us retailers. 

* Target Price: $17
* Entry: &lt;$13
* Risk: 4.5
* Timeframe: 3-5 months

**$SPCE:** Virgin Galactic provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. As of recent, it feels like we have entered a new space age, or race. Especially with Elon Musk and his SpaceX garnering a lot of attention, almost anything space related is doing well. I feel as if this one is over bought solely based on a lot of hype and possibly fear of missing out (FOMO). I'll be waiting for a correction, but if it corrects, I'll pick up some LEAPS most likely. 

* Target Price: $65
* Entry: &lt;$45
* Risk: 4
* Timeframe: 2-5 months

**$FUTU:** Futu Holdings is an investment holding company engaged in offering digitized brokerage platforms, most notably MooMoo.com. This one keeps coming across my radar, so I check out MooMoo's mobile and desktop app. They offer free lvl 2 data, decent margin rates, and access to invest in Hong Kong and Chinese stocks (very interesting for me). The mobile app is nice, but the desktop app is very laggy for me as of now. Nevertheless, $FUTU keeps on pushing up. If they improve the desktop version, I might start trading a little bit there. Also, I think they should rebrand. MooMoo is a strange name although I see they are going for a bull or cow noise. Its a Chinese company and in Chinese the word 'niu' for bull and cow are often interchangeable. It is to expensive for me now, but I'll be watching it closely. 

* Target Price: $170
* Entry: &lt;$133

**Notable Mentions:**

**$PLTR:** Palantir back at it again. I get a lot of questions regarding this one. Is it technically a meme stock? Do you remember when I first wrote about it? 

https://preview.redd.it/o86334hmakg61.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40e2b574a287ef9551cf223d04d9b44c13c5db44

 And this is as of today: 

https://preview.redd.it/nyerlwfnakg61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bfc8fb52016397527aff24dcb1345f001502e99

It almost was exactly what I thought with my green/red arrows! Right now, I might sell a put and hope to get assigned at a cheaper price. Other than that, it is pushing toward the first level of targets so I'll keep watching it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**$AAPL:** Currently I have the April 16th $150 calls; they are down. If $AAPL continues at its current slope of support, it should intersect with my BEP (break even price) exactly on the expiration date.  

https://preview.redd.it/azse284takg61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508c0a902d32c89a99bf1ae15fc8e81691d9d3d7

 A more realistic hypothetical prediction: 

https://preview.redd.it/1ruj1o5uakg61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07fa47e31fdf952aec8f2268459b0c64eb22a78f

 

So if this does play out the way I hope, I'd take profit in the yellow circle. Let's just see how it plays out in the next few days. If you are looking to get into this one, I'd say give it a couple extra months to play it more conservative than I have. If you are already in it with me, we might roll it out in the future. 

Also, I picked up some AAPL LEAPS deep ITM at $120 with a delta of 70 today.

Note: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest.

# -Advanced Beginner-

## Spreads

* Spreads (with 2 legs) are neat because they manipulate how delta and theta act.  It caps your gains and losses, but you can profit with less stock movement.  Try several spreads on a P/L calculator to see for yourself.
* Spreads usually require margin trading.
* Spreads allow you to define max losses (assuming you close before expiration day) and use less capital.
   * Experienced traders will open many spreads at identical/similar strikes to heavily profit off movement.  Spreads can make you/lose you a lot of money if you are right.
   * For example: I could make $200 premium off a $500 risk trade, max loss would be $300.  This is much more effective capital utilization than a naked or cash secured put, however it does not have the same downside protection or “wheel” potential as a written/sold put.  Higher risk, higher reward.
* Vertical Debit spreads:  I think of these like mini calls/puts.  I personally don’t use them unless calls are outrageously expensive or the break even is absurdly high, but there’s nothing wrong with them.  A call debit spread will lower your breakeven and overall cost vs just a call.  You can do clever things like making a positive theta call spread if you’re creative.  I like doing this since I hate losing money to theta.
* Vertical Credit spreads: 
   * Very good theta strategy to define downside/upside risks.
   * A put credit spread is bullish and allows you to bet on upward movement with less capital and defined losses.
   * A call credit spread is a bearish strategy that allows you to bet on downward movement.  These are very cool since they allow you to sell calls without selling naked calls, which can ruin you financially.  I see selling these as better than buying puts since it’s so much easier to be profitable; to be redundant, Θ rocks.

* **I repeat this on purpose: Don't EVER leave short spreads open on expiration day, close them.  If you don't close, they better be VERY far from the strike on a non-volatile stock.  In after hours a stock can jump/dip below your strike and be exercised without the other leg to protect you.  This can lead to massive, life ruining losses.  This is not an exaggeration, google this and be scared.  It happened to a fair number of people with TSLA.**

## Trading Mechanics, Taxes, Market Manipulation

* Learn about wash sale rules.  They suck and are very easy to activate with options.  This will eliminate your ability to write off losses.  Over trading can easily cause wash sales.  
[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp)
* Order Fills:
   * A good broker will fill your orders quicker, potentially with better prices.
   * I tried using RobinHood for cheap spreads and iron condors to save money.  It ultimately ended up costing me money.
   * I recently watched RH fail to close an Iron Condor for $10 over the market price for an hour.  I eventually had to pay even higher over market rate to close it, which cost way more than trading fees.
   * I have placed identical vertical spread orders on E-trade &amp; RH; E-trade filled almost immediately, sometimes cheaper than my limit price.  RH sometimes did not fill at all.  I have had to “chase” spreads in RH by adjusting my price, losing me even more money.
   * Free brokers often provide the illusion of saving money.  If you save a $.50-.65 commission, but get a fill that is $1-2 worse, you actually lost money by using a free broker.
* Short attacks:
   * Learn to recognize these sketchy attacks by hedges/firms.  They manipulate the market, it’s been documented countless times.  A common one is rapid short selling, which pushes the price down.
   * Short Ladder attacks:
      * [https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)
      * Some people say short ladder attacks don't exist.  I've seen some very strange stock nosedives off low volume, so I tend to think they do.
   * If you plan well enough and the market doesn’t give up on the stock you may be able to use it as a great opportunity to buy the dip.
* Cramer explains how he intentionally manipulated the market when he ran a hedge fund years ago.  Multiple links to the video are below since this video gets pulled often, Cramer / The street never wanted this to go public.
   * Reuters article: [https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320](https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320)

   * [https://youtu.be/QFfjX8dW-QQ](https://youtu.be/QFfjX8dW-QQ)
   * Due to this video I don’t fully trust Cramer.  His show can give you stock ideas to buy (or inverse), but you never know where his true loyalties lie.
* Plan for taxes if you are up big.  You may need to over withhold or contribute to taxes quarterly depending on your situation.  [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306)

## Technical Indicators / Technical Analysis (WIP)

* Technical indicators can be very useful to plan trades or attempt to predict stock movements.  Resistance and supports can be fairly reliable.
* Very common indicators are 50, 100, &amp; 200 day moving averages, volume, RSI, and MACD.  I use these most of the time.
* Volume Profile
* Bollinger Bands:
* Moving Average Envelope
* Rainbow Moving Average Indicator

# -Intermediate / Advanced Strategies (work in progress)-

*You’ll notice many of these strategies inverse one another.*

## Short Strangle / Straddle

* Both of these strategies profit from little price movement.  I recommend using a P/L calculator to determine BE, profit, etc.
* A straddle sells (or buys) two options at the same expiry and strike.
* A strangle sells (or buys) two options at same expiry with different strikes.
* Both these strategies involved selling a Call and a Put for a credit.  Straddle uses ATM legs, strangle uses OTM legs.
* Limited max profits and unlimited risk.  Due to the unlimited risk, I am not a fan.  However, many people like these a lot.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx)
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-straddle.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-straddle.aspx)

## Iron Condor and Iron Butterflies

* These strategies profit from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  They receive a credit to open and benefit from theta decay.  If your stock is range bound, these may be a good choice.
* These are both 4 ""legged"" trades, so you will have 4 trading fees to enter or exit the trade.  A lower cost broker shines here.  However, “bad” free brokers (like RH) will give you poor fills, which is not worth the discount  (see fills above).
* Condors and butterflies have ""wings"" which are your purchased puts and calls.  The wider the wing the higher the max profit/risk.  The condor body can be riskier and skinny with a narrow high profit range or wider for a much greater chance of success with lower payout.
* An iron condor is built by combining a put credit spread and a call credit spread with the same expiry.
* An iron condor can be thought of as a modified short strangle with limited risk, and therefore a bit less profit.  I prefer defined limited risk.
* The butterfly is similar except instead of a plateau it has a sharp peak.  My personal mental note is that a condor looks more like a strangle with wings, while a butterfly looks like a straddle with wings.
* Pay attention to earnings dates when you open these, I have forgotten to check before and it led to bad trades.

## Long Condor (Debit Call Condor)

* The debit version of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to stay inside your defined range.  This strategy profits from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  I’ve never tried this, Iron Condors make more sense to me.
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/condor.aspx)

## Short Condor (Credit Call Condor)

* Inverse of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to go OUTSIDE your defined range.  These are useful when you expect significant price movement.  Credit to open.
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* Can be harder to set up.  I want to try these, haven’t yet.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-condor.aspx)

## Reverse Iron Condor

* Inverse of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to go OUTSIDE your defined range.  These are useful when you expect significant price movement.  Debit to open.
* I haven’t gotten to try these yet, looking for a good opportunity right now
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/reverse-iron-condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/reverse-iron-condor.aspx)

## LEAPS

* Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities
* LEAPS Options are options that are long term with many DTE, often over a year until expiration.  LEAPS calls are great for long term growth plays (downtrends with LEAP puts) or simply when you really like a company and can't afford 100 shares.  LEAPS (or any ""longer term"" option) enables you to sell a PMCC or PMCP (below)
* They are technically over 1 year.  Sometimes people informally refer to options with over 6 months DTE as LEAPS.
* LEAPS are always technically used for both 1 or multiple LEAPS since it’s an acronym.  I sometimes informally call a single contract a LEAP so I don’t sound like a tool.

## Diagonal Spreads: PMCC / PMCP

* PMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call (or poor man's covered puts).  They are diagonal options, often used with purchased LEAPS.  You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.  These are very powerful; I’m using them more and more often to replace “non-explosive” growth calls.
* For PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.  These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.  If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting ""blown by"" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.  Keeping your purchased LEAP deeper ITM should protect you.  Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.
* I'm currently tinkering with these myself.  So far I like .7-.9 delta call LEAPS with 30-45 DTE calls on my CC.  The goal is to hold the LEAP long term, potentially until expiration, and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.  Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAP anymore.
* Some people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my cost basis until it's zero (or even negative).  I have a page in my notebook I write each CC on my NIO LEAP (I Meme stock sometimes).  I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.  When I originally wrote this I had \~2 years left on it and it's 9-10% paid for; that doesn't even count the actual gains the LEAP has.
* TT states this is considered an IV play, which I partially agree with.  You want to buy these during low IV times since an IV drop will hurt your LEAP value.  I look at them more as a way to sell calls/puts on a high IV company with a lot of price movement and potential upside/downside.

## Advanced Orders

* Guide to several order types: [https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/order-types-from-basic-to-advanced-07162019](https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/order-types-from-basic-to-advanced-07162019)
* One Triggers Other (OTO):
   * Good brokers will allow you to set these up, some will require a desktop to do it.  This lets you link one action to another.  In programming think of it like an if-then.  You’ll tie a buy/sell to another buy/sell
   * Setting trailing stops on options is very chaotic since their price movement can be drastic due to volatility.  I prefer to set my trailing stop to a stock. 
   * What I like to do is set a trailing stop on a stock (or just link it to a stock price drop) and have it sell 1 share I own.  Then it immediately executes a market order to sell my call.  I’ve had good luck doing this with incredibly volatile plays where stop losses aren’t effective.  I’ll often have an order saved and ready saved for when a strong run up starts.  When my price alerts start blowing up my phone, I’ll immediately hit execute to turn it on.

   * I have placed identical vertical spread orders on E-trade &amp; RH; E-trade filled almost immediately, sometimes cheaper than my limit price.  RH sometimes did not fill at all.  I have had to “chase” spreads in RH by adjusting my price, losing me even more money.
   * Free brokers often provide the illusion of saving money.  If you save a $.50-.65 commission, but get a fill that is $1-2 worse, you actually lost money by using a free broker.
* Short attacks:
   * Learn to recognize these sketchy attacks by hedges/firms.  They manipulate the market, it’s been documented countless times.  A common one is rapid short selling, which pushes the price down.
   * Short Ladder attacks:

      * Some people say short ladder attacks don't exist.  I've seen some very strange stock nosedives off low volume, so I tend to think they do.
   * If you plan well enough and the market doesn’t give up on the stock you may be able to use it as a great opportunity to buy the dip.

## Technical Indicators / Technical Analysis (WIP)

* Technical indicators can be very useful to plan trades or attempt to predict stock movements.  Resistance and supports can be fairly reliable.
* Very common indicators are 50, 100, &amp; 200 day moving averages, volume, RSI, and MACD.  I use these most of the time.
* Volume Profile
* Bollinger Bands:
* Moving Average Envelope
* Rainbow Moving Average Indicator

## Short Strangle / Straddle

* Both of these strategies profit from little price movement.  I recommend using a P/L calculator to determine BE, profit, etc.
* A straddle sells (or buys) two options at the same expiry and strike.
* A strangle sells (or buys) two options at same expiry with different strikes.
* Both these strategies involved selling a Call and a Put for a credit.  Straddle uses ATM legs, strangle uses OTM legs.
* Limited max profits and unlimited risk.  Due to the unlimited risk, I am not a fan.  However, many people like these a lot.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx)
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-straddle.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-straddle.aspx)

## Iron Condor and Iron Butterflies

* These strategies profit from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  They receive a credit to open and benefit from theta decay.  If your stock is range bound, these may be a good choice.
* These are both 4 ""legged"" trades, so you will have 4 trading fees to enter or exit the trade.  A lower cost broker shines here.  However, “bad” free brokers (like RH) will give you poor fills, which is not worth the discount  (see fills above).
* Condors and butterflies have ""wings"" which are your purchased puts and calls.  The wider the wing the higher the max profit/risk.  The condor body can be riskier and skinny with a narrow high profit range or wider for a much greater chance of success with lower payout.
* An iron condor is built by combining a put credit spread and a call credit spread with the same expiry.
* An iron condor can be thought of as a modified short strangle with limited risk, and therefore a bit less profit.  I prefer defined limited risk.
* The butterfly is similar except instead of a plateau it has a sharp peak.  My personal mental note is that a condor looks more like a strangle with wings, while a butterfly looks like a straddle with wings.
* Pay attention to earnings dates when you open these, I have forgotten to check before and it led to bad trades.

## Long Condor (Debit Call Condor)

* The debit version of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to stay inside your defined range.  This strategy profits from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  I’ve never tried this, Iron Condors make more sense to me.
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/condor.aspx)

## Short Condor (Credit Call Condor)

* Inverse of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to go OUTSIDE your defined range.  These are useful when you expect significant price movement.  Credit to open.
* Limited risk / limited reward.
* Can be harder to set up.  I want to try these, haven’t yet.
* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-condor.aspx)

## Reverse Iron Condor

* Inverse of an Iron Condor.  You expect the price to go OUTSIDE your defined range.  These are useful when you expect significant price movement.  Debit to open.
* I haven’t gotten to try these yet, looking for a good opportunity right now
* Limited risk / limited reward.

## LEAPS

* Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities
* LEAPS Options are options that are long term with many DTE, often over a year until expiration.  LEAPS calls are great for long term growth plays (downtrends with LEAP puts) or simply when you really like a company and can't afford 100 shares.  LEAPS (or any ""longer term"" option) enables you to sell a PMCC or PMCP (below)
* They are technically over 1 year.  Sometimes people informally refer to options with over 6 months DTE as LEAPS.
* LEAPS are always technically used for both 1 or multiple LEAPS since it’s an acronym.  I sometimes informally call a single contract a LEAP so I don’t sound like a tool.

## Diagonal Spreads: PMCC / PMCP

* PMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call (or poor man's covered puts).  They are diagonal options, often used with purchased LEAPS.  You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.  These are very powerful; I’m using them more and more often to replace “non-explosive” growth calls.
* For PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.  These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.  If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting ""blown by"" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.  Keeping your purchased LEAP deeper ITM should protect you.  Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.
* I'm currently tinkering with these myself.  So far I like .7-.9 delta call LEAPS with 30-45 DTE calls on my CC.  The goal is to hold the LEAP long term, potentially until expiration, and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.  Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAP anymore.
* Some people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my cost basis until it's zero (or even negative).  I have a page in my notebook I write each CC on my NIO LEAP (I Meme stock sometimes).  I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.  When I originally wrote this I had \~2 years left on it and it's 9-10% paid for; that doesn't even count the actual gains the LEAP has.
* TT states this is considered an IV play, which I partially agree with.  You want to buy these during low IV times since an IV drop will hurt your LEAP value.  I look at them more as a way to sell calls/puts on a high IV company with a lot of price movement and potential upside/downside.

* Guide to several order types: [https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/order-types-from-basic-to-advanced-07162019](https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/order-types-from-basic-to-advanced-07162019)
* One Triggers Other (OTO):
   * Good brokers will allow you to set these up, some will require a desktop to do it.  This lets you link one action to another.  In programming think of it like an if-then.  You’ll tie a buy/sell to another buy/sell
   * Setting trailing stops on options is very chaotic since their price movement can be drastic due to volatility.  I prefer to set my trailing stop to a stock. 
   * What I like to do is set a trailing stop on a stock (or just link it to a stock price drop) and have it sell 1 share I own.  Then it immediately executes a market order to sell my call.  I’ve had good luck doing this with incredibly volatile plays where stop losses aren’t effective.  I’ll often have an order saved and ready saved for when a strong run up starts.  When my price alerts start blowing up my phone, I’ll immediately hit execute to turn it on.

Another painful week for tech and growth, I might as well just copy and paste what for last week's ""What to Watch"" - 

""Last week was a painful one as the Nasdaq, tech and semiconductors retreated the most as bond interest rates rose and money shifted into post-pandemic stocks. Towards the end of the week, even the Dow Jones took a hit. Friday we saw bond yields cool off and the $QQQ saw a half of a percent gain.""

The ten year treasury is up more and it is seemingly having a negative affect on our beloved tech and growth stocks. The only thing up is financial sector, which would supposedly benefit from high interest rates, and oil. Don't be fooled, in my opinion, this is a sign that our current dip will be short lived. 

* **Financial** and **Energy** will be most disrupted with the new innovation.
* This is a good time to buy tech, growth and innovation.  
* We are not in a bubble. (my opinion)

The current length and slope of the September dip, which this cool off is being compared to all the time, is the same now. We might be in for one more red day if this is somewhat correlated. It might not be - take it with a grain of salt. 

https://preview.redd.it/15btxxwmfpl61.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0204563b9e2c805e8146ff7fd3004610aace5256

 Nevertheless, keep this in mind.  

https://preview.redd.it/te8vvuoofpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=037edbd963533ae2fcf28713a7eb4f557bc14d99

 

The retail investors, the mom and pops, and the working mothers that are looking toward the stock market for secondary income will be the most affected from a dip like this. Eventually many people can't take the loss anymore and will cut their positions at the bottom. They can't afford to lose everything and not be able to feed their kids, meanwhile hedge funds and money managers seem to have endless money to keep buying the plummeting market. 

I do feel like there is an uptick in online sentiment about buying tech and growth. However, I do believe that the ten year treasury will hit 2%. As you can see from the TNX chart below, the yield goes up and down periodically. This isn't something new and or surprising. 

https://preview.redd.it/rq7bv6qpfpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2acf2ae870998b7eacdadd41e2085487d0bc16e

What is surprising is the overall agreement that this is somehow correlated to the decline in tech. Below is the QQQ (orange line), or NASDAQ ETF, that is tech heavy and the candle stick chart is the TNX (10 year treasury yield). As you can see, sometimes the QQQ goes up and the TNX goes down. Sometimes both go up or both go down. And sometimes QQQ is down and the TNX is up.  

https://preview.redd.it/l6t5knhrfpl61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d37548f59b0f16367c4589a3def0f6319243a00

 

The argument is that these tech companies will be hurt from rising interest rates, but I wouldn't expect it would be so much. Opening the economy will help travel and leisure and the in person retail will improve. However, I don't buy for a minute that now that consumers are use to ordering everything online due to lockdowns, that they won't continue to do this and go back to big box, leaving behind online shopping as the past. This time is over, in my opinion. Covid helped innovation and disruptive stocks get some sort of a jump start and I don't see this rolling back. Look to the future for what will disrupt the norm now. Look for things that will totally change how we live everyday life. Don't follow benchmarks of the past.

**With that said, these are the tickers I'm looking to next week.** 

***Continuing the Dip:***

$**ERX**: ERX provides 2x leveraged exposure to the S&amp;P Energy Select Sector Index—a market-cap-weighted index of US energy companies from the S&amp;P 500, heavily-weighted towards the handful of firms that dominate the energy sector. With oil prices rising since late last year, there is a decent opportunity to buy this for short term play to capture some profits during this dip. Not to mention $ERX has a dividend yield of 1.24%.

$**GUSH**: GUSH seeks to deliver 200% of the daily performance of the S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production Select Industry Index. Unlike State Street’s XOP—an unlevered fund tracking the same index—GUSH uses over-the-counter derivatives to achieve its objective. $GUSH doesn't provide as good as a dividend so I am bias toward $ERX. I've noticed that the performance over the past two weeks has been more or less the same. 

$**FAS**: FAS provides 3x leveraged exposure to the Russell 100 Financial Services Index—a subset consisting of large-cap financial companies from the Russell 1000 Index. For example some of the top holdings are Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Black Rock, and Goldman Sachs. With rising bond yields the financial sector has been doing pretty well over the last two weeks. If the dip continues into next, I expect this to be a good short term play. More so it is not bad to have exposure to the financial sector in your portfolio.

https://preview.redd.it/uqlmrroufpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b7a7b8c1d43669c361ec72b52a66f9aa1c2d5ed

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***Buying the Dip:*** 

$**TSLA**: Tesla, the leader in the Electric Vehicle, battery and autonomous driving industry, is having a 30% sale and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is buying it up. Remember, only buy the dip if you can see yourself holding these stocks for 5-20 years. If so, then it isn't a problem to see them fall a little. $TSLA is holding up on the 180MA, usually a very strong support. Let's see what next week has in store. 

https://preview.redd.it/djepah1xfpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=722117fb3844a3d7f201b7a605c89249cc14e485

$**BUZZ**: VanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the BUZZ NextGen AI US Sentiment Leaders Index (the “Sentiment Leaders Index”). I think this new ETF can hold up rather well during a dip and hopefully capture good growth. It is to new to perform TA on, but I'm interested in buying $BUZZ's top holdings anyway. I can't find any major 'meme stock' holdings in it.  

https://preview.redd.it/9cfy1880gpl61.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb9de2b4c90719cb5ff18589bc51b7a452a8b3fe

$**SOXL/$TECL**: Both of these 3X bull ETFs have obviously taken huge hits over the last two weeks. That doesn't scare me off, and in fact I will be buying more. Not often do we get such chances. With such huge dips, that only means there is more room for growth going forward. Eventually the 10 year will get priced into the market and growth, tech and innovation will have money flowing back into them.  

https://preview.redd.it/l49igzs1gpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3461f179587cb0fbe210d7f01d9613207b402e2

$**ARK Invest ETF**s: Most of the ARK ETFs have also approached the 180MA on the day candle stick chart. I believe that this cool off will be short lived and this provides us a great chance to buy into innovation. I wouldn't invest my entire portfolio into ARK ETFs, however, I am very interested in DCA into more LEAPS on these very soon.  

https://preview.redd.it/moltpkg3gpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0694d1cb3dc2342ed3c84aba06691ba955f699c

$**SPCX**: SPCX is the first actively-managed Special Purpose Acquisitions Corporations (SPACs) ETF in the market. The fund seeks capital appreciation by holding a broad portfolio of SPACs or “blank check” companies and firms that have completed their initial public offering (IPO) within the last two years. I've invested in a lot of SPACs year to date, and there is a lot of information to digest, remember, and act on. Depending on the management, this could make that all very easy. After all, SPACs are beating the S&amp;P500. Tread carefully here! I recommend dollar cost averaging only a few shares per day.  

https://preview.redd.it/7nl3ejt4gpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe0c8adf709cdfa3bc7507580ba12459f0df4fb3

$**RBLX**: Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), an online gaming platform created in 2004, allows users to design and create multiplayer games and share them with friends and other users. Roblox offers a free-to-play multiplayer program supported through in-game purchases using “Robux,” the platform’s digital currency. There is a lot of excitement about this IPO. I will be watching it closely. A lot of times early investors take this time to sell off shares.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As for the 'buying the dip picks', I'd dollar cost average into them every other day, no matter up or down. The 'continuing the dip picks' are my short term plays that I'd sell off partial or all, after the 10 year is priced in.

The current length and slope of the September dip, which this cool off is being compared to all the time, is the same now. We might be in for one more red day if this is somewhat correlated. It might not be - take it with a grain of salt.

 Nevertheless, keep this in mind.  

https://preview.redd.it/te8vvuoofpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=037edbd963533ae2fcf28713a7eb4f557bc14d99

 

The retail investors, the mom and pops, and the working mothers that are looking toward the stock market for secondary income will be the most affected from a dip like this. Eventually many people can't take the loss anymore and will cut their positions at the bottom. They can't afford to lose everything and not be able to feed their kids, meanwhile hedge funds and money managers seem to have endless money to keep buying the plummeting market. 

I do feel like there is an uptick in online sentiment about buying tech and growth. However, I do believe that the ten year treasury will hit 2%. As you can see from the TNX chart below, the yield goes up and down periodically. This isn't something new and or surprising. 

https://preview.redd.it/rq7bv6qpfpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2acf2ae870998b7eacdadd41e2085487d0bc16e

What is surprising is the overall agreement that this is somehow correlated to the decline in tech. Below is the QQQ (orange line), or NASDAQ ETF, that is tech heavy and the candle stick chart is the TNX (10 year treasury yield). As you can see, sometimes the QQQ goes up and the TNX goes down. Sometimes both go up or both go down. And sometimes QQQ is down and the TNX is up.  

https://preview.redd.it/l6t5knhrfpl61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d37548f59b0f16367c4589a3def0f6319243a00

 

The argument is that these tech companies will be hurt from rising interest rates, but I wouldn't expect it would be so much. Opening the economy will help travel and leisure and the in person retail will improve. However, I don't buy for a minute that now that consumers are use to ordering everything online due to lockdowns, that they won't continue to do this and go back to big box, leaving behind online shopping as the past. This time is over, in my opinion. Covid helped innovation and disruptive stocks get some sort of a jump start and I don't see this rolling back. Look to the future for what will disrupt the norm now. Look for things that will totally change how we live everyday life. Don't follow benchmarks of the past.

If you haven't already listened to Cathie Wood's [interview from March 5th](https://ark-invest.com/videos/market-commentary/march-5-2021-in-the-know-with-cathie-wood/), I highly recommend it.

**With that said, these are the tickers I'm looking to next week.** 

***Continuing the Dip:***

$**ERX**: ERX provides 2x leveraged exposure to the S&amp;P Energy Select Sector Index—a market-cap-weighted index of US energy companies from the S&amp;P 500, heavily-weighted towards the handful of firms that dominate the energy sector. With oil prices rising since late last year, there is a decent opportunity to buy this for short term play to capture some profits during this dip. Not to mention $ERX has a dividend yield of 1.24%.

$**GUSH**: GUSH seeks to deliver 200% of the daily performance of the S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production Select Industry Index. Unlike State Street’s XOP—an unlevered fund tracking the same index—GUSH uses over-the-counter derivatives to achieve its objective. $GUSH doesn't provide as good as a dividend so I am bias toward $ERX. I've noticed that the performance over the past two weeks has been more or less the same. 

$**FAS**: FAS provides 3x leveraged exposure to the Russell 100 Financial Services Index—a subset consisting of large-cap financial companies from the Russell 1000 Index. For example some of the top holdings are Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Black Rock, and Goldman Sachs. With rising bond yields the financial sector has been doing pretty well over the last two weeks. If the dip continues into next, I expect this to be a good short term play. More so it is not bad to have exposure to the financial sector in your portfolio.

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***Buying the Dip:*** 

$**TSLA**: Tesla, the leader in the Electric Vehicle, battery and autonomous driving industry, is having a 30% sale and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is buying it up. Remember, only buy the dip if you can see yourself holding these stocks for 5-20 years. If so, then it isn't a problem to see them fall a little. $TSLA is holding up on the 180MA, usually a very strong support. Let's see what next week has in store. 

https://preview.redd.it/djepah1xfpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=722117fb3844a3d7f201b7a605c89249cc14e485

$**BUZZ**: VanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the BUZZ NextGen AI US Sentiment Leaders Index (the “Sentiment Leaders Index”). I think this new ETF can hold up rather well during a dip and hopefully capture good growth. It is to new to perform TA on, but I'm interested in buying $BUZZ's top holdings anyway. I can't find any major 'meme stock' holdings in it.  

https://preview.redd.it/9cfy1880gpl61.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb9de2b4c90719cb5ff18589bc51b7a452a8b3fe

$**SOXL/$TECL**: Both of these 3X bull ETFs have obviously taken huge hits over the last two weeks. That doesn't scare me off, and in fact I will be buying more. Not often do we get such chances. With such huge dips, that only means there is more room for growth going forward. Eventually the 10 year will get priced into the market and growth, tech and innovation will have money flowing back into them.  

https://preview.redd.it/l49igzs1gpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3461f179587cb0fbe210d7f01d9613207b402e2

$**ARK Invest ETF**s: Most of the ARK ETFs have also approached the 180MA on the day candle stick chart. I believe that this cool off will be short lived and this provides us a great chance to buy into innovation. I wouldn't invest my entire portfolio into ARK ETFs, however, I am very interested in DCA into more LEAPS on these very soon.  

https://preview.redd.it/moltpkg3gpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0694d1cb3dc2342ed3c84aba06691ba955f699c

$**SPCX**: SPCX is the first actively-managed Special Purpose Acquisitions Corporations (SPACs) ETF in the market. The fund seeks capital appreciation by holding a broad portfolio of SPACs or “blank check” companies and firms that have completed their initial public offering (IPO) within the last two years. I've invested in a lot of SPACs year to date, and there is a lot of information to digest, remember, and act on. Depending on the management, this could make that all very easy. After all, SPACs are beating the S&amp;P500. Tread carefully here! I recommend dollar cost averaging only a few shares per day.  

https://preview.redd.it/7nl3ejt4gpl61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe0c8adf709cdfa3bc7507580ba12459f0df4fb3

$**RBLX**: Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), an online gaming platform created in 2004, allows users to design and create multiplayer games and share them with friends and other users. Roblox offers a free-to-play multiplayer program supported through in-game purchases using “Robux,” the platform’s digital currency. There is a lot of excitement about this IPO. I will be watching it closely. A lot of times early investors take this time to sell off shares.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As for the 'buying the dip picks', I'd dollar cost average into them every other day, no matter up or down. The 'continuing the dip picks' are my short term plays that I'd sell off partial or all, after the 10 year is priced in.

You can read more about that affect in the prior GME post but with TLRY I wanted to focus a bit on spreads vs outright calls.

With stock around $55 and the 65 strike seeing a ton of buying I wanted to directly compare a debit call spread, to buying an out-of-the-money call like the 65, and the costs, risks, and opportunity associated with both.

Real DD from JP Morgan Quant on Oil / Energy Equities

""According to JPMorgan quant *Kolanovic*, the biggest short squeeze yet is set to begin next month as systematic funds, momentum chasers, trend followers and the CTA community in general cover their legacy shorts in the energy sector and go long. CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive. However, this is in the context of a huge systematic net short overhang in the energy sector. In other words, energy - in all forms be it oil or energy stocks - remains the most hated sector across all investors.

The catalyst that forces the squeeze is the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the Covid crisis, at which point various vol metrics followed by vol-control funds will reset and they will have no choice but to go long. That - *and this is the punchline of Kolanovic's thesis*  \-  will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which is also a gentle hint from the JPM quant to all the redditors out there: if you want to spark a truly historic short squeeze, one which forces systematic shorts to not only cover but to go long, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks.

Kolanovic was kind enough to even give you the timing: you have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor **""will need to rebalance in March by closing \~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding \~2% to energy longs, for a \~22% net buying in Energy.""**

What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Well, the Croatian quant calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about \~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, **""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn.""** It could be far, far more. As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&amp;P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. And, remarkably, **the most recent number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&amp;P 500 average**.

https://preview.redd.it/95h8uq9bquj61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0632e1b65f80fd25d66e5c4c95be3f811110b68

&amp;#x200B;

We then said that since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance. It now appears that said frontrunning of the CTA squeeze officially kicked off yesterday because according to Goldman prime on Monday, Feb 22, on the same day the bank saw the largest net selling in US Macro Products since Jan 27, the biggest increase in ETF shorts since November (offset however by aggressive buying in single names), **it also observed the official start of sector rotation into energy stocks, as ""energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years"" a +5.8 sigma move.**

*Here are the market details from Goldman's Prime Service for Feb 22:*

**The GS Prime book saw the largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-1.5 SDs vs. the average daily net flow of the past year), driven by short sales outpacing long buys 5 to 1.**

**US equities – Largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-2.0 SDs) driven by short sales in Macro Products**

* **Macro Products** (Index and ETF combined) saw the largest net selling since Jan 27th.  Macro Products have been net sold in 9 of the past 10 trading days.
* **ETF shorts increased +4.3%** – the largest 1-day increase since November – driven by Large Cap, Technology, and Corporate Bond ETFs. ETF shorts have increased +9% week/week (+25% YTD) and now make up 21.4% of the non-Index US short book, the highest level on our record going back to 2012.
* **Single Names were modestly net bought overall** (+0.2 SDs) – Sector flows were split driven by net buying in Energy (long buys &gt; short covers), Real Estate (short covers &gt; long sales), Comm Svcs (long buys &gt; short sales), and Health Care (long buys &gt; short sales) vs. net selling in Info Tech (short sales &gt; long buys), Materials (long sales), Financials (short sales &gt; long sales), and Consumer Disc (long sales &gt; short covers).

Real DD from JP Morgan Quant on Oil / Energy Equities

""According to JPMorgan quant *Kolanovic*, the biggest short squeeze yet is set to begin next month as systematic funds, momentum chasers, trend followers and the CTA community in general cover their legacy shorts in the energy sector and go long. CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive. However, this is in the context of a huge systematic net short overhang in the energy sector. In other words, energy - in all forms be it oil or energy stocks - remains the most hated sector across all investors.

The catalyst that forces the squeeze is the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the Covid crisis, at which point various vol metrics followed by vol-control funds will reset and they will have no choice but to go long. That - *and this is the punchline of Kolanovic's thesis*  \-  will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which is also a gentle hint from the JPM quant to all the redditors out there: if you want to spark a truly historic short squeeze, one which forces systematic shorts to not only cover but to go long, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks.

Kolanovic was kind enough to even give you the timing: you have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor **""will need to rebalance in March by closing \~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding \~2% to energy longs, for a \~22% net buying in Energy.""**

What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Well, the Croatian quant calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about \~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, **""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn.""** It could be far, far more. As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&amp;P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. And, remarkably, **the most recent number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&amp;P 500 average**.

&amp;#x200B;

We then said that since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance. It now appears that said frontrunning of the CTA squeeze officially kicked off yesterday because according to Goldman prime on Monday, Feb 22, on the same day the bank saw the largest net selling in US Macro Products since Jan 27, the biggest increase in ETF shorts since November (offset however by aggressive buying in single names), **it also observed the official start of sector rotation into energy stocks, as ""energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years"" a +5.8 sigma move.**

*Here are the market details from Goldman's Prime Service for Feb 22:*

**The GS Prime book saw the largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-1.5 SDs vs. the average daily net flow of the past year), driven by short sales outpacing long buys 5 to 1.**

**US equities – Largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-2.0 SDs) driven by short sales in Macro Products**

* **Macro Products** (Index and ETF combined) saw the largest net selling since Jan 27th.  Macro Products have been net sold in 9 of the past 10 trading days.
* **ETF shorts increased +4.3%** – the largest 1-day increase since November – driven by Large Cap, Technology, and Corporate Bond ETFs. ETF shorts have increased +9% week/week (+25% YTD) and now make up 21.4% of the non-Index US short book, the highest level on our record going back to 2012.
* **Single Names were modestly net bought overall** (+0.2 SDs) – Sector flows were split driven by net buying in Energy (long buys &gt; short covers), Real Estate (short covers &gt; long sales), Comm Svcs (long buys &gt; short sales), and Health Care (long buys &gt; short sales) vs. net selling in Info Tech (short sales &gt; long buys), Materials (long sales), Financials (short sales &gt; long sales), and Consumer Disc (long sales &gt; short covers).

**Energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years (+5.8 SDs), w**hile Info Tech was the most net sold sector, the $ net selling was relatively modest (-1.0 SDs) driven by short sales.

* **FAAMG (GSTMTMEG) – Collectively the TMT Mega Caps were modestly net bought yesterday,** driven by risk-off flows with short covers outpacing long sales 1.4 to 1. The group had been net sold for four straight days (8 of the past 10) coming into yesterday – aggregate long/short ratio (MV) of the group had declined -33% MTD to 14.6, which is in the 23rd percentile vs. the past year.

NotAJanitorOK,0.0,164.0,"For the life of me I seem to be confused about selling covered calls. Here is my scenario: I own 400 shares of AAPL with an average price of $135. Now it shows that there is a strike price of $137 expiring next week, with a bid of $0.90. 

So I can sell 4 contracts (since I have 400 shares) at the strike price of $137 for next week, with the bid of $0.90. 0.90*400 = $360 from the premium. So if next week comes, and AAPL is only at $136 and not my strike price of $137, then that day of expiry I will keep my shares, but also make $360? And if say AAPL is $140 by the expiry date, then I still make $360 + I make the difference of selling 400 shares at $137 so an additional $800 so my total profit for that week would be $1,160 (minus commission fees).

o	What is PEG ratio?

o	The PEG ratio (P/E to Growth ratio) is the P/E ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings. (It's used to determine a stock's value based on trailing earnings while also taking the company's future earnings growth into account, and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio). The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation.

o	A lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. According to well-known investor Peter Lynch, a company's P/E and expected growth should be equal, which denotes a fairly valued company and supports a PEG ratio of 1.0. A PEG less than 1.0 is considered undervalued, while a PEG over 1.0 is considered overvalued

*Notes on positions:*

* $BHC, $MOS, and $T plays were opened as a result of a sub-strategy I want to experiment with, where I simply follow whale trades. I am starting small. I am naturally skeptical about $T’s upside but it seems like it’ll be the next thing retail chases and that is consistent w/ my momentum-following strategy.
* I promised myself I’d get back into $NPA once it touched ~$18, so I did.

**Updates:**

Since my last update, most of my realized gains have come from $IPOE (where I sold a bunch of July losers and bought closer April expiries for gamma) and $STPK (**thank you** to the redditor who replied in my last journal entry and put me onto the ticker!). But my P/L % still remains the same while current positions (namely IPOE, as always) take on losses (oh and obviously because I added more cash haha).

Some other positions I’ve had in between screenshots:

* $CCIV: I initially did a poor man’s covered strangle yesterday but sold the short put almost immediately for a $200 gain (on the flip side, though, I had to roll my short call up and out and it’s already breached 😭). Opened up another short put today. 

* $ARKF: I was excited to learn that $ARKF finally had weeklies, but I didn’t do much thinking when I selected my short call for a PMCC. I opened -1 63C and closed it with an -$80 loss, which is eating into the profit currently seen in the table/screenshot. **Two lessons learned**: 1. select a higher strike when it comes to PMCCs/CCs on $ARKF because she’s a steady climber, and 2. If your short call gets breached, there’s always a chance that profit will return when the underlying falls (as it did today). I should have just left my short call alone.

Other positions that were seen in my last screenshot but are now gone:

* $DKNG: sold for a tiny gain (and for portfolio clean-up, to be honest)
* $FTOC: closed this spread for a tiny loss because I don’t think the underlying is going to move much. This actually brushed against -50% loss a couple times, and I have a rule (seen in my first post) to close at -50%, so I’m happy that I was able to close this for a smaller loss.

**Plans:**

* This $CCIV rolled short call is mentally killing me. I can wait for IV to drop some more (it did today, and IVR dropped about 10) and reassess, and/or I can employ a short-term hedge with a calendar call (short upfront, long further out) to further protect against my short call and augment the gains in my long LEAP and short put. The obvious risk with this hedge is if the underlying comes down. 

* My reliance on Chamath has been tested by his newfound quietness. As some on Discord/Twitter have speculated, his lawyers have probably gotten to him. I am going to temporarily treat $IPOE the same way I treated $BFT, where I sell my calls on a green day and buy back in on a red day (instead of holding tight and waiting for the next Chamath catalyst). I’ll also hold on to a stash of July losers (since I am a true believer) and use those calls as my buy-and-hold. But I should probably buy a hedge put sometime…

* I am undecided on what my % exits are for my whale-following plays, mostly because this is my first time employing this strategy. 

* I’m gonna keep scooping up $ARKF calls on red days, forget this PMCC nonsense. 

**Random Thoughts:**

* Fintech is lagging while everyone crowds EV, and I’ve been late to the EV party admittedly, so I’m just going to follow the masses here. 
* SNPR feels like my next big gamma gainer.

alpe77,0.0,130.0,"I just learned something important, and wanted to share: [https://www.tastytrade.com/shows/market-measures/episodes/atm-vs-otm-decay-curves-12-16-2020](https://www.tastytrade.com/shows/market-measures/episodes/atm-vs-otm-decay-curves-12-16-2020). I believed there was only one option decay curve, but it turns out it’s different for ATM vs OTM options. This has significant implications for trading strategies, depending on your goals.

Takeaways:

&amp;#x200B;

* ATM options decay exponentially (like a stone falls as it flies), with the rate of decay accelerating as it approaches expiration. *Most of the decay happens in the last 21 days.*
* OTM options have in inverse decay curve (like a landing plane), i.e. *they lose most of their value prior to the 21-day mark*, and the rate of decay decreases in the last 21 days.
* Gamma risk is higher ATM, so ATM options should be managed at smaller profit targets, e.g. 25% (unless you don’t mind assignment, and don’t care)
* Be aware of the which situation applies to your positions. You may have sold an OTM put, but if it is ATM now, you should adjust your mental model.
* ATM options
* Therefore:

&amp;#x200B;

* If you just want the premium, sell 45-day options, and close them around 21 DTE or 50% of max profit. These will decay quickly and more safely.
* If you’re feeling extra bullish, sell 45-days ATM, and close at 25% of max profit or 21 DTE. Same advice as always from TT, but it’s nice to understand why.
* For core positions: If you don’t mind being assigned, sell 30-, or even 21-DTE ATM puts, and hold until about 7 days. The last week is still not ideal, because the Gamma (directional sensitivity over time) gets really high near expiration, causing large profit/loss swings, for not much more premium.",1,ATM and OTM options have different decay curves,130.0,0.95,"ATM and OTM options have different decay curves I just learned something important, and wanted to share: [https://www.tastytrade.com/shows/market-measures/episodes/atm-vs-otm-decay-curves-12-16-2020](https://www.tastytrade.com/shows/market-measures/episodes/atm-vs-otm-decay-curves-12-16-2020).

The idea is based on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k9savf/spac_picks_via_basic_search_analytics_google_vs) post, suggesting that finding good DD that hasn't been too pumped up yet can work as a strategy.  The site tries to check how pumped a stock is by pulling stock price, 50DA, 52 week high, etc., checking for recent news and it links to number of mentions on WSB, etc. It also tries to pull stock price the moment you load the page for each DD and compares it to the price retrieved at the time the DD was posted so you can see how the DD is doing over time. 

How it's set up: 

Each DD is broken down into 3 sections.  The Post, The Numbers and The Chatter.  Click on each for more detail.  In The Post, you can see the DD immediately on-page by clicking ""See the DD"".  Add notes, I've occassionally added a TLDR or summary of the play in the Our Dumb Notes box to remind me.  In ""The Numbers"" section, you can add the symbol where the site was too dumb to add it automatically.  It'll then add the basic stock price info.  It doesn't do foreign tickers right now.   There's also a leader board that tracks how each DD has done over time.  See what ideas have done the best.  I also added a few benchmarks in there.  

I added new functionality recently that listens for new DD on WSB, runs it through the stock price/news checks and automatically adds it to the top of the list.  So, assuming it works, should be no need for the ""Get Latest Posts"" button.  This wasn't always there, so some previous DDs got missed when I was just pulling manually with the button.  The site checks for new DD every 30 seconds, but for the truly impatient, I kept the ""Get Latest Posts"" button.On the leaderboard page, scroll down to the actual individual DD leaderboard.  You can sort by all the column headers.  Just click one.  I like to sort by Change (%).  Oh, and there are links to the original DD on reddit, to the user who did it, to yahoo finance for more stock info for the ticker, etc. 

A buddy of mine is building a complementary app.  I'll be sure to mention it when he's done.   

There are bugs.  It sucks that if the site can't pull the ticker, then the % change since posting is obviously off.  Some DD's from the last few months are missing 'cause it wasn't pulling automatically until recently.  Also, I'm a dad with a full-time job, so I built this mostly late at night and worried my wife and her boyfriend with 3am screen-staring for a while.  Point is, it's far from perfect.This post should've been 2 lines.  But there's a lot of crap on the site and hopefully this answers most of the questions.  Shoutout to the other WSB projects, [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3hyws/a_palantir_post_made_its_way_to_my_feed_randomly/) inspired me.

boii0708,0.0,182.0,"***TLDR; make smaller trades, trade different stocks for diversification, and make sure your portfolio isn’t 100% dependent on either the market or volatility going in a particular direction.***

I've been seeing a lot of posts lately from people blowing up their accounts in one way or another, and I would say most if not all of these happened because of a lack of risk management. When you're trying to build an options portfolio, there are strategies and rules you can implement to minimize the chances of half your portfolio evaporating.

**Money Management and Position Sizing**

There was a study in 2016 where participants were given $25 and were asked to bet on coin clips for 30 minutes. The coin was weighed so it would land on heads 60% of the time, but the payout was 1:1. Despite the obvious mathematical advantage, 28% of the participants wiped out. out of 61 participants, 18 bet their entire bankroll in one go.

Position sizing is especially important when options trading. Yes, you might have an edge, but variance is always worse than you expect. If you wouldn't bet your net worth on a coin toss, why would you bet more than you can afford to lose on weeklies that expire worthless 70% of the time? By keeping your individual position sizes small, you reduce the risk of any single trade wiping you out. Check out the Kelly criterion if you want to learn more about ""optimal"" betting sizes.

Personally, I try to keep the risk of each position under 5% of my portfolio. That doesn't necessarily mean that I can only spend 5% of my portfolio buying power on one trade, but I might have a stop loss equal to a 5% loss of my overall portfolio.

For example, if you have a $1,000 account, you can spend $200 on RKT weeklies if you want, but if you follow the 5% rule, you should have a stop loss and close the trade when your calls lose $50.

On top of that, I wouldn’t have more than 50% of my account at risk at any given time. This way, I can buy the dip when it happens, or give my (short) positions a bit of extra margin if things go wrong. Options utilize leverage, so you don't need to use every dollar of buying power available to you.

**Asset Diversification**

Aside from keeping your account in multiple smaller positions, you want to keep your holdings in different assets. If you have a bunch of small positions but they're all in meme/tech stocks, you're probably not having a good month right about now. Spread out your trades across different sectors of stocks. A portfolio with PLTR, RKT, BLNK, NIO, and TSLA is going to be a lot risker than a portfolio with PLTR, GLD, SPY, BA, and TLT. I'm not saying don't trade the meme stocks, but they shouldn't be 80% of your portfolio.

Good tickers to trade are liquid, well known, and generally not too correlated with each other. An example watchlist could be AAPL, BA, CRSR, SPY, IWM, QQQ, PLTR, GLD, WMT, and MS. The broad market indexes SPY, IWM, and QQQ are more correlated than most, but you can use them to adjust your portfolio - IWM is more small caps, and QQQ is good for tech exposure.

**Directional Diversification**

In addition to trading different stocks, you might also want to trade in different directions. Stocks in different sectors might be less correlated, but a broader market downturn could still hurt your portfolio. You might want to have long deltas for some of your positions and short deltas on other stocks.

Maybe you think that the financial sector is going to outperform and tech is on a bit of a downwards trend, maybe you want to be short tech for a while instead of just waiting to buy the dip. I'm personally a net seller of options, so I might sell put spread on MS and call spreads on AAPL. This way, even when the broader market dips I'm okay since at least one of my trades will do really well.

It's good practice to look at the beta of your portfolio, and see what your PnL looks like compared to moves in a benchmark of your choice. Your broker should be able to calculate how correlated individual stocks are to your benchmark and determine how your portfolio is affected by market conditions. If your broker doesn't do that, please get a better broker. If you're playing on Robinhood with a few hundred bucks, fine. But if you're trading seriously and have a profit goal instead of an entertainment budget, please switch to something like TOS or IBKR.

For me, IBKR's risk navigator lets me know that by next month, I'll make $500 on my overall (theta gang) portfolio as long as SPY stays within +/- 5% of where it is today. Of course, I can boost my returns even more through managing my trades; squeezing some more gains out of my winners, and losing the minimum on trades that go wrong.

**Volatility Diversification**

Ever hear of IV crush? When you buy calls right before earnings, your stock pops up 10% the next day, and you still lose all your money? That's implied volatility working against you. Similarly, if you're only long vega and the market + the VIX calms down, it's suddenly a lot harder for you to make money. Even directionally uncorrelated assets like SPY and TLT have correlated volatility; when the market tanks, everybody rushes into bonds for safety. While SPY falls and TLT increases, both have become more volatile for different reasons. If you've only got Iron Condors on these two tickers, you might be in trouble.

Have some positions that benefit from increased volatility and some that are the other way around. If you only have short strangles and credit spreads, maybe try some calendar spreads on stocks with lower volatility. If you only have debit spreads, maybe you might want to sell some Iron Condors on med-high IV rank stocks.",1,"Risk Management, or How to Not Lose Your House",182.0,0.96,"Risk Management, or How to Not Lose Your House ***TLDR; make smaller trades, trade different stocks for diversification, and make sure your portfolio isn’t 100% dependent on either the market or volatility going in a particular direction.***

I've been seeing a lot of posts lately from people blowing up their accounts in one way or another, and I would say most if not all of these happened because of a lack of risk management. When you're trying to build an options portfolio, there are strategies and rules you can implement to minimize the chances of half your portfolio evaporating.

**Money Management and Position Sizing**

There was a study in 2016 where participants were given $25 and were asked to bet on coin clips for 30 minutes. The coin was weighed so it would land on heads 60% of the time, but the payout was 1:1. Despite the obvious mathematical advantage, 28% of the participants wiped out. out of 61 participants, 18 bet their entire bankroll in one go.

Position sizing is especially important when options trading. Yes, you might have an edge, but variance is always worse than you expect. If you wouldn't bet your net worth on a coin toss, why would you bet more than you can afford to lose on weeklies that expire worthless 70% of the time? By keeping your individual position sizes small, you reduce the risk of any single trade wiping you out. Check out the Kelly criterion if you want to learn more about ""optimal"" betting sizes.

Personally, I try to keep the risk of each position under 5% of my portfolio. That doesn't necessarily mean that I can only spend 5% of my portfolio buying power on one trade, but I might have a stop loss equal to a 5% loss of my overall portfolio.

For example, if you have a $1,000 account, you can spend $200 on RKT weeklies if you want, but if you follow the 5% rule, you should have a stop loss and close the trade when your calls lose $50.

On top of that, I wouldn’t have more than 50% of my account at risk at any given time. This way, I can buy the dip when it happens, or give my (short) positions a bit of extra margin if things go wrong. Options utilize leverage, so you don't need to use every dollar of buying power available to you.

**Asset Diversification**

Aside from keeping your account in multiple smaller positions, you want to keep your holdings in different assets. If you have a bunch of small positions but they're all in meme/tech stocks, you're probably not having a good month right about now. Spread out your trades across different sectors of stocks. A portfolio with PLTR, RKT, BLNK, NIO, and TSLA is going to be a lot risker than a portfolio with PLTR, GLD, SPY, BA, and TLT. I'm not saying don't trade the meme stocks, but they shouldn't be 80% of your portfolio.

Good tickers to trade are liquid, well known, and generally not too correlated with each other. An example watchlist could be AAPL, BA, CRSR, SPY, IWM, QQQ, PLTR, GLD, WMT, and MS. The broad market indexes SPY, IWM, and QQQ are more correlated than most, but you can use them to adjust your portfolio - IWM is more small caps, and QQQ is good for tech exposure.

**Directional Diversification**

In addition to trading different stocks, you might also want to trade in different directions. Stocks in different sectors might be less correlated, but a broader market downturn could still hurt your portfolio. You might want to have long deltas for some of your positions and short deltas on other stocks.

Maybe you think that the financial sector is going to outperform and tech is on a bit of a downwards trend, maybe you want to be short tech for a while instead of just waiting to buy the dip. I'm personally a net seller of options, so I might sell put spread on MS and call spreads on AAPL. This way, even when the broader market dips I'm okay since at least one of my trades will do really well.

I had a decent amount of money on some LEAPs in CVS going into earnings a few weeks ago, expecting reports to give it a nice boost. Well, that was the opposite of what happened. In all honesty, I didn't lose that much looking back. For some reason this triggered me though.

Later in the day after CVS earnings, I liquidated my whole portfolio. I guess out of fear of losing that money from the failed trade, forever? I don't know. I got greedy. I decided that NIO was a good pick to put all my money into OTM calls on. I wanted to make that money back. I worked hard for it. So that's what I did. Well, I just happened to buy these calls the day that NIO went on it's first 6 day losing streak in what seems like forever.

aMereMortalxxx,0.0,111.0,"**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I still have a few positions open from last week that I opened on the red days. These include: PLTR, CRSR, DKNG, FEYE, PTON, U. Still holding and will add some of these new positions this week.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

If downside continues I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks through the lower trend channel into the $78 level. In my opinion Cloudflare will continue it's up-trend so I would be ok with owning after a temporary dip. Selling $85 strike puts 4 weeks out will yield enough return to give break-even point at $80 per share. Theoretically I am locking in buying NET for $80 a share if I do that.

Palantir has earnings coming up Tuesday. It got rejected by the same resistance 2 times in the $38-40 area. Now it's back down to $32 after a 20% drop. IV super high and won't be able to get in before earnings, I did happen to sell some Friday though. If PLTR drops on earnings I will be looking to sell more cash-secured-puts and capitalize on what remains of the implied volatility.

**Positions on the watchlist**

I won't list positions here yet because this will be moving crazy at the open on Tuesday.

FSLY has been super volatile throughout the last 6 months. Look at the wide range it's been trading in with nearly 30% monthly swings. Similar to NET it's been in an over-all uptrend as the sector remains strong. FSLY gapped down last week back to $100 level and near the lower trend channel. In my opinion this is another play where I like the risk vs reward that I am entering the trade. I'll feel comfortable selling exactly at the pink line which will be around the $100 level strike.

**Positions on the watchlist**

12 March, 2021 $100 strike puts for $9.75 or $975 premium.

Return: 10%, break-even share price: $90. &gt;&gt; Stock price needs to drop below $90 to LOSE money on this trade.

ARCT hit me hard 2 months ago. I entered the play the afternoon before it dropped 50% on news of their testing results. I was able to recover 95% of my losses before exiting the position at close to neutral about 3 weeks later. Here we go again. When I look at the chart I want to sell closer to the blue line, but we may not get there. IV is super high, so even selling $68 strike put, nearly 10% OTM, will still give us good premiums.

Tickers on the watchlist this week: NET, PLTR, FSLY, ARCT",111.0,0.91,"I draw with crayons so you don't have to. The grind up continues. Tickers on the watchlist this week: NET, PLTR, FSLY, ARCT **What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I still have a few positions open from last week that I opened on the red days. These include: PLTR, CRSR, DKNG, FEYE, PTON, U. Still holding and will add some of these new positions this week.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

Its been a rough few weeks for many, so I figured might be worth a post in itself.  Lightly edited with a few clarifications.*

As someone who's been trading options since 1998 and has made/lost plenty either way, you need to stay solvent long enough to be right.  Never feel like ""this is the one"", you need to spread your risk across instruments and time.  Buying positions in 10 different companies in a single day isn't any smarter than buying in 1, if they are highly correlated tech companies.

Also be mechanical about your exits.  You'll live a far happier life reaping 80% of potential gain vs sitting and losing 100% of your position.  So take profits, or this doesn't work.

But if you have 3+ months left on a position, not much that happened in the last 3 days should affect that timeline.  Even if you think the market itself is rolling over, that's a reason to always have money in reserve and put it to work during a major disruption.

With options, money is fuel, and you need to make it last until you can get good (or lucky).  In reality you'll make 90% of your money from a handful of plays out of hundreds.   I try to never be more than 50% invested, keeping powder dry for an 10%+ correction.

Don't over-trade.  There aren't really that many good moves in an average day (or most weeks).

If things stop working, stop doing what you're doing.  Take a break.  Markets change, you will too.

And never chase a big move.  Buying naked calls/puts is fundamentally a contrarian trade, if you chase you'll get crushed on premiums every time.   Maybe try vertical spreads but execution can be a serious issues when the market goes nuts.

Most of my long positions are OTM LEAP vertical spreads.  Why spreads? Because I'm willing to give up some upside to greatly reduce my risk (cost basis).  And LEAPs because I can be wrong for far longer before I'm eventually right.  And I don't have to constantly stress about exits.

When the poop hits the fan, people care about short term protection, not where the DOW will be in two years.  So for short plays its usually a near time window with naked OTM puts, as volatility works in your favor if you get in ahead of the main move.

Hope you packed chocolate, and please don't feed the fishes.

This represented a 164% quarter-over-quarter increase from the $1.13 billion the firm held at the end of the third quarter.

Remember: This Friday Warren Buffet will file his 13F and well know whether he bought Tesla during Q4 2020.

It plans to launch a satellite to lunar orbit this year for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as part of the Gateway effort to return humans to the moon.

The tech sector took a hard hit today with the DOW managing a small gain. The rising inflation and bond yields were eventually going to get priced in; there was little doubt it would not. Also, the Biden stimulus was finally confirmed but that more benefitted the DOW than tech. 

There is nothing that I would like to add to the watchlist today as I prefer to dollar cost average my bigger positions on days like today, especially tech. Tomorrow let's see if we see a small bounce back and if we do, I don't expect this week to finish out green for tech.

esInvests,0.0,90.0,"Taking the time to ask yourself a few questions can significantly improve your trade experience. I know everyone wants to get into trades quick and make fat stacks. The problem is we (myself included) frequently go off half cocked and fail to consider pertinent details as we place a trade - particularly when trading derivatives that contain numerous variables. Here's an overview of what I like to ask and how I answer them.

**1. Any news coming?**  
Earnings, trial releases, etc. Any sort of pending information release that may lead to a binary event. I've entered multiple trades only to find there was something coming out half way through my expiration. There's nothing wrong with placing a trade when there's a binary event pending. The important part is KNOWING there is something coming and incorporating that information into the trade. For example, if I want to trade something and I find out it has earnings released in 30 days, I may simply enter a shorter DTE trade OR plan to manage before the event. This information will also inform how I manage the trade - if I DON'T want to manage through a binary event and something starts fighting with me, I may take the trade down at a loss as compared to adjusting and maintaining exposure. 

**2. What is my PnL target?**  
This one is straight forward. When will I exit the trade if things go in my direction? Am I going to close for a loss if things go against me? If so, when? If not, what is my plan? For example, if I'm trading naked short puts (read, don't want to take assignment) in a 30 DTE cycle. Based on my backtesting, I like to take these down between 55 and 60% max profit. If I'm executing my quant short put strat, I will exit when the option trades at 2.5X credit received (this was born from backtesting). If I'm executing my traditional NSP strategy, I likely would roll the product vice exiting and moving on for a loss. What does that look like?

**3. What is my management plan?**  
If I know I'm not going to simply close a trade at a specific PnL, I like to work through how I intend to manage the position in different circumstances. We already have the profit side worked out. So continuing the previous example, when do I adjust the short puts? When it's ATM? At a specific DTE? At a specific premium? There are a lot of variables that depend on the strategy I'm executing. In general, I will evaluate my roll when S=K (stock equals my strike) and then execute the roll IF my option becomes at threat of early assignment (not a huge deal, can easily un-assign the trade but it's inconvenient). All of my strategies incorporate a trade allocation and outlay. Allocation is the total capital I'll put in a trade, outlay is how much of that allocation I'll enter with. When do I use the extra capital to scale in? All of those variables are defined in this question. 

It may seem time consuming and if you're doing a good job, it is. Most traders are largely unsuccessful with a minority emerging profitable and a smaller minority beating the market consistently. We need to be an outlier and perform better than the vast majority of retail traders. To do that, we need to put in the work. The positive note is once you do this process a handful of times it really doesn't speed up and becomes reflexive. 

What questions do you like to ask yourself before placing a trade?

vasiche,0.0,91.0,"Almost everything in life has opportunity costs/trade-offs.  For investing or trading there are a lot of strategies: passive (index funds) to aggressive (WSB gambling style) with many options within that range.

For passive index fund investing:

1) Almost zero time investment on my part - just set automatic investing based on payroll dates and forget it.  I can use free time in other parts of my life or on other ways to earn additional money if I wanted.

2) Over the long term, expected return is about 10% (not adjustment for inflation) - for example, DJIA is about 10%/year (so, $100 in one year will be $110).

3) Favorable tax treatment of capital gains (long-term gains since these are long-term investments) - 0-20%.

For options trading:

1) Requires more time than passive investing in index funds.

2) Likely will result in higher annual returns.  I just took a simple example of WalMart shares and ran some numbers using the wheels strategy.  I roughly calculated 20% annual returns.  Of course, there are higher risks here too (compared to passive investing).

3) Less favorable treatment of investment / earned returns (short-term capital gains) - 0-37%

prostockadvice,0.0,83.0,"Another day with rising bond yields and a transition into the 'new growth' stocks and away from tech according to many talking heads. This is precisely the time to buy more tech stocks in my opinion. When there is blood in the streets, including your own, it is time to dollar cost average. When everyone is fearful, buy more. Yes, there is a transition into recovery stocks including the financial and banking industry. However, in a few months, if you stay strong now, we will be getting paid. The treasury bond yields won't always go up. We are not sure how long the current market condition will last, so I would strongly suggest not getting into any short term positions unless it is a hedge against tech or semiconductors.

Looks like another weird day where my portfolio is up $214,000. Looks like I am doing something right. (actually it is because Webull updated the $SOXL and $TECL splits)

I'm not going to add anything to the watchlist today and until we see a couple of green days. We need to cut our smaller, shorter term positions, and dollar cost average into our longer term buy and holds. For myself, I'm considering buying more into semiconductors and tech. This is what I did last September during the dip and after a month and a half, it paid off nicely. 

The real question on everyone's minds is how much longer will we suffer. The truth is, no one  knows. On the $QQQ we are two days past breaking the 50MA support and it seems as if our trendlines aren't holding. The $SPY is currently testing the 50MA and pecking on the bullish SuperTrend. And my favorite, $SOXL is back down to levels first seen 10 days ago when we hit the 'low' of the dip.

To put everything into perspective, we were at all time highs on February 12th for most of these growth stocks; that is just short of 3 weeks ago. Most of the technical don't look all that horrible. Contrary to popular belief, stonks don't always go up - and these cool off periods are healthy overall.

I am still sticking to my initial strategy of:

1. Cut short term positions until market stops bleeding.
2. Use the capital to dollar cost average my longer term positions starting with what is down the most. 
3. Wait for bond yields to stop rising and the mini panic to pass. 

This can be rather difficult if you are a new trader. Stay strong my friends, and know that we will eventually get paid.

SimilarMiddleFinger,0.0,84.0,"Volatility is one of the six inputs of an option-pricing model. Some of the other inputs - strike price, stock price, the number of days until expiration, and the current interest rate - are easily observable.

Some traders mistakenly believe that volatility is based on a directional trend in the stock price. Not so, by definition, volatility is simply the amount the stock price fluctuates, without regard for direction.

As an individual trader, you really only need to concern yourself with two forms of volatility: historical volatility and implied volatility. Historical volatility is defined in textbooks as ""the annualized standard deviation of past stock price movements."" But here, let's just say it's how much the stock price fluctuated on a day-to-day basis over a one-year period.

Implied volatility isn't based on historical pricing data on the stock. Instead, it's what the marketplace is ""implying"" the volatility of the stock will be in the future, based on the price changes in an option. Like historical volatility, this figure is expressed on an annualized basis. But implied volatility is typical of more interest to retail options traders than historical volatility because it's forward-looking.

For a specific stock price

Implied volatility is a dynamic figure that changes based on activity in the options marketplace. Usually, when implied volatility increases, the price of options will increase as well, assuming all other things remain constant. So when implied volatility increases after a trade has been placed, it's good for the option owner and bad for the option seller.

Conversely, if implied volatility decreases after your trade is placed, the price of options usually decreases. That's good if you're an option seller and bad if you're an option owner.

Given implied volatility will yield a unique option value. Take a stock trading at $44.22 that has the 60-day $45-strike call at a theoretical value of $1.10 with an 18% implied volatility level. If the stock price remains constant, but IV raises to 19%, the value of the call will rise by its vega (in this case let's say about 0.07). The new value of the call will be $1.17 ($1.10+0.07). Rising IV another point to 20%, raises the theoretical value by another 0.07, to $1.24.

The question is: Where does implied volatility come from?

Based on truth and rumors in the marketplace, option prices will begin to change. If there's an earnings announcement or a major court decision coming up, traders will alter trading patterns on certain options. That drives the price of those options up or down, independent of stock price movement. Keep in mind, it's not the options' intrinsic value(if any) that is changing. Only the options' time value is affected.

The reason the option' time value will change is because of changes in the perceived potential range of future price movement on the stock. Implied volatility can then be derived from the cost of the option. In fact, if there were no options traded on a given stock, there would be no way to calculate implied volatility.",1,Implied volatility,84.0,0.97,"Implied volatility Volatility is one of the six inputs of an option-pricing model.

Lots of catalysts and news over the weekend as well as the Senate passing the stimulus bill so be ready for some great trading opportunities! However, I'm personally not going to be jumping in any long-term plays. I'm still a little skeptical about the recovery we had last Friday and whatever happens this coming week (even if we start out green).

I hope you have a great rest of your weekend and have a profitable trading week ahead!

**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 8 // Targets Hit = 8 // Success Rate: 100%**

&amp;#x200B;

**$AAPL**\----Took a few days, but $119 target was hit Thursday after Powell’s interview

**$GRPN**\----HUGE WIN on this one! Hit all targets and blew past our “best case scenario” target

**$STMP**\----First three price targets hit ($165-188), almost reached fourth one at $207

**$RKT**\----$24 target hit and BLOWN out of the water! Doubled our target and reached above $40

**$STPK**\----Hit first and almost hit second target, but sold off right at the open on Monday and continued downtrend all week

**$BBY**\----Only hit first and second price target before selling off after earnings report, back at second price target as of this past Friday in AH trading

**$CZR**\----Hit first two long targets on the move up, then hit all our short targets on the way down

**$SNOW**\----Only hit first two targets before selling off

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

\*\* - denotes the plays I actually like and will be watching

&amp;#x200B;

**$MBIO:** was in a constant downtrend since January, but has been running along support since March 4. Currently holding above support at $3.09. The next resistances, which are also our price targets, are $3.31 &gt; $3.49 &gt; $3.90.

&amp;#x200B;

**$DKNG:**  finally cooling off from that monster run it had the past week from earnings. It’s now showing strength on support and starting to recover from that support. However, it might meet resistance around $61.50 - $62. If it breaks and holds….

Price Targets: $64 &gt; $66 &gt; $68 &gt; $70 &gt; $74 (ATH / best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**$NOK:** Was also in a steady downtrend ever since the huge meme stock fiasco. Starting to bounce up from support and show strength around $3.80. Next resistances, which are our price targets are.... $4.00 (conservative) &gt; $4.29 &gt; $4.57

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*$PLTR:** olding above horizontal and uptrend support on the daily and 4hr chart. Currently sitting near support so still a somewhat good time to enter imo. Next resistance is 50 EMA on the 4hr chart, next one is around $26. Some great news/catalysts came out last week. Should see some good movement.

Price Target: $26 (very likely) &gt; $27 (conservative) &gt; $29 &gt; $32

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*$MARA:** Strong bounce off the 200 ema and horizontal/uptrend support on the 4hr chart. Look for resistance around the $31.28 area as that’s a fib level. BTC hit an ATH over the weekend, so the BTC-related stocks will definitely be a good play and worth watching. It might be a little too late to get in for a swing to the upside, but potential short swings or day trades could be present.

Price Targets: $38 &gt; $44 &gt; $49 (ATH / best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**$TQQQ:** Strong bounce off 200 ema last Friday on the daily chart, also bouncing off support at $75.06 and heading up towards resistance of $89.04. Look for a break and continuation past that if momentum and buying pressure comes through.

Price Targets: $93 &gt; $98 &gt; $104

&amp;#x200B;

**$HITIF:** The daily chart looks great, but the 4hr chart tells a very different story. RSI, MACD, Stochastics Slow still show we’re in a downward trend so it’s still too early to get in imo. Wait to see if it’ll reach the $0.5044 area to get in. If it does dip that low and shows strength look for….

Price Targets: $0.54 (conservative) &gt; $0.59 &gt; $0.70 &gt; $0.88 (ATH/best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\* $BAC:** Currently holding above support at $34.91, prior price action shows a high of $55 before it started to downtrend. The 78.6% fib level on the retracement from that downward trend is $43 so that is a great PT for a long term swing. Conservative PT I’d set around $39. Then the next resistances after that. The 100% fib level retracement is $54.95 so that is our best case scenario

Price Targets: $39 (conservative) &gt; $43 &gt; $54.95

Just finished typing up the notes for potential plays we covered earlier. Below you'll find said notes. If you want to see the charts along with the notes included, you can view them [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing) I usually post the video link as well, but it's much easier for you to look at the chart photos rather than scrolling through the 1-2hr video.

Lots of catalysts and news over the weekend as well as the Senate passing the stimulus bill so be ready for some great trading opportunities! However, I'm personally not going to be jumping in any long-term plays. I'm still a little skeptical about the recovery we had last Friday and whatever happens this coming week (even if we start out green).

I hope you have a great rest of your weekend and have a profitable trading week ahead!

Edit: Thank you very much for the awards! But seriously, use that money as your ammunition for the markets instead!

**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 8 // Targets Hit = 8 // Success Rate: 100%**

&amp;#x200B;

**$AAPL**\----Took a few days, but $119 target was hit Thursday after Powell’s interview

**$GRPN**\----HUGE WIN on this one! Hit all targets and blew past our “best case scenario” target

**$STMP**\----First three price targets hit ($165-188), almost reached fourth one at $207

**$RKT**\----$24 target hit and BLOWN out of the water! Doubled our target and reached above $40

**$STPK**\----Hit first and almost hit second target, but sold off right at the open on Monday and continued downtrend all week

**$BBY**\----Only hit first and second price target before selling off after earnings report, back at second price target as of this past Friday in AH trading

**$CZR**\----Hit first two long targets on the move up, then hit all our short targets on the way down

**$SNOW**\----Only hit first two targets before selling off

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

\*\* - denotes the plays I actually like and will be watching

&amp;#x200B;

**$MBIO:** was in a constant downtrend since January, but has been running along support since March 4. Currently holding above support at $3.09. The next resistances, which are also our price targets, are $3.31 &gt; $3.49 &gt; $3.90.

&amp;#x200B;

**$DKNG:**  finally cooling off from that monster run it had the past week from earnings. It’s now showing strength on support and starting to recover from that support. However, it might meet resistance around $61.50 - $62. If it breaks and holds….

Price Targets: $64 &gt; $66 &gt; $68 &gt; $70 &gt; $74 (ATH / best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**$NOK:** Was also in a steady downtrend ever since the huge meme stock fiasco. Starting to bounce up from support and show strength around $3.80. Next resistances, which are our price targets are.... $4.00 (conservative) &gt; $4.29 &gt; $4.57

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*$PLTR:** olding above horizontal and uptrend support on the daily and 4hr chart. Currently sitting near support so still a somewhat good time to enter imo. Next resistance is 50 EMA on the 4hr chart, next one is around $26. Some great news/catalysts came out last week. Should see some good movement.

Price Target: $26 (very likely) &gt; $27 (conservative) &gt; $29 &gt; $32

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*$MARA:** Strong bounce off the 200 ema and horizontal/uptrend support on the 4hr chart. Look for resistance around the $31.28 area as that’s a fib level. BTC hit an ATH over the weekend, so the BTC-related stocks will definitely be a good play and worth watching. It might be a little too late to get in for a swing to the upside, but potential short swings or day trades could be present.

Price Targets: $38 &gt; $44 &gt; $49 (ATH / best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**$TQQQ:** Strong bounce off 200 ema last Friday on the daily chart, also bouncing off support at $75.06 and heading up towards resistance of $89.04. Look for a break and continuation past that if momentum and buying pressure comes through.

Price Targets: $93 &gt; $98 &gt; $104

&amp;#x200B;

**$HITIF:** The daily chart looks great, but the 4hr chart tells a very different story. RSI, MACD, Stochastics Slow still show we’re in a downward trend so it’s still too early to get in imo. Wait to see if it’ll reach the $0.5044 area to get in. If it does dip that low and shows strength look for….

Price Targets: $0.54 (conservative) &gt; $0.59 &gt; $0.70 &gt; $0.88 (ATH/best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\* $BAC:** Currently holding above support at $34.91, prior price action shows a high of $55 before it started to downtrend. The 78.6% fib level on the retracement from that downward trend is $43 so that is a great PT for a long term swing. Conservative PT I’d set around $39. Then the next resistances after that. The 100% fib level retracement is $54.95 so that is our best case scenario

Price Targets: $39 (conservative) &gt; $43 &gt; $54.95

**LONG TERM PRICE TARGETS! BAC IS A SNAIL. Moves &lt;$1.00 move on average each day**

&amp;#x200B;

**$ATVI:** Bouncing off support on the daily and 4hr chart ($91.78), but has to get over the 50 ema and uptrend resistance before I feel comfy getting in. Will have to wait and see what happens during PM, but if it does get over those resistances and shows strength, look for…

wernerf,0.0,70.0,"Found myself in another rabbit hole this afternoon, per usual. Wanted to open this one up for discussion here and shed some light for others that are interested in adding this to their watch list.

First off, I'm sure there are smarter, taller, better looking people in this sub that have other thoughts on this and I'm all for it. I'm merely pointing out some sort of Pepe Silvia style investigation that is leading me to purchase these 16-April-21 $15 Calls at the open tomorrow.

**Company Profile:**

PAYA (Pronunciation is up for interpretation) is a leading provider of integrated payment and frictionless commerce solutions that help customers accept and make payments, expedite receipt of money, and increase operating efficiencies. The company processes over $30 billion of annual payment volume across credit/debit card, ACH, and check, making it a top 20 provider of payment processing in the US and #6 overall in e-Commerce.

Today's Options Activity, as well as 1-Mar-2021 &amp; 26-Feb-2021

**Unusual Activity**

PAYA's Option Volume today was 3607 (Average Volume: 318). Of this 3607, 98.6% were Calls and 1.4% were Puts. I know, I know, not super interesting. Scratching beyond the surface of it:

* 2377 of these Options contracts purchased today were OTM for 16-April-21 $15 Calls (322 different trades across the day)

* Another 304 were purchased OTM 19-Mar-21 $15 (Probably Irrelevant Weekly YOLO'ers)

**Further Into the Rabbit Hole We Go**

* Paya is a fairly recent result of a SPAC, as of October 19, 2020: [Article if interested](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gtcr-announces-completion-of-payas-public-offering-via-spac-merger-301154274.html)
* r/WSB's favorite hedgie, Steven A. Cohen, bought up 16.4% of this stock on March 1st through Point72 Asset Management, L.P., Point72 Capital Advisors, Inc., Cubist Systematic Strategies, LLC, and through himself.

* For what it's worth, a post in r/SPACs shows that PAYA is one of Franklin Templton's 7 PIPEs and they don't seem to miss...that bad.

* Analysts Price Targets are anywhere from $15-$18 over the next 12 months with a 2 of those coming in over the past week

BTIG's Mark Palmer on his $18 Target Price:

&gt;BTIG Sees Paya Holdings (PAYA) as a Takeout Candidate, PT Raised to $18  
&gt;  
&gt;2 months ago  
&gt;  
&gt;The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the belief that this could put smaller payments and commerce technology providers such as PAYA in play. He stated ""While we view PAYA, which remains on pace to generate almost $40bn of transaction volume in 2021, as a compelling stand-alone story given its strong prospects for growing sales of bundled software and payments to \~100K middle-market customers in underpenetrated verticals, we believe its attractiveness as a takeout target should be supportive of its valuation"".

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - 16-April-21 $15 Calls had unusual activity today and I got bored so I wrote this to convince myself to buy them.**

Interested to see if anyone has insight/thoughts regarding the Options activity and Cohen's recent purchase. This was my first time doing this sort of thing, but really would like to discuss something other than meme stocks for a bit.

*Disclaimer: I was an art major, not a chance in hell I'm a financial advisor and you should proceed at your own risk.*

**EDIT:** Was asked to share activity from Wednesday, March 3rd (aka today), I posted it below. Again, I merely wanted to point out something I found interesting.

Wanted to open this one up for discussion here and shed some light for others that are interested in adding this to their watch list.

First off, I'm sure there are smarter, taller, better looking people in this sub that have other thoughts on this and I'm all for it. I'm merely pointing out some sort of Pepe Silvia style investigation that is leading me to purchase these 16-April-21 $15 Calls at the open tomorrow.

**Company Profile:**

PAYA (Pronunciation is up for interpretation) is a leading provider of integrated payment and frictionless commerce solutions that help customers accept and make payments, expedite receipt of money, and increase operating efficiencies. The company processes over $30 billion of annual payment volume across credit/debit card, ACH, and check, making it a top 20 provider of payment processing in the US and #6 overall in e-Commerce.

Today's Options Activity, as well as 1-Mar-2021 &amp; 26-Feb-2021

**Unusual Activity**

PAYA's Option Volume today was 3607 (Average Volume: 318). Of this 3607, 98.6% were Calls and 1.4% were Puts. I know, I know, not super interesting. Scratching beyond the surface of it:

* 2377 of these Options contracts purchased today were OTM for 16-April-21 $15 Calls (322 different trades across the day)

* Another 304 were purchased OTM 19-Mar-21 $15 (Probably Irrelevant Weekly YOLO'ers)

**Further Into the Rabbit Hole We Go**

* Paya is a fairly recent result of a SPAC, as of October 19, 2020: [Article if interested](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gtcr-announces-completion-of-payas-public-offering-via-spac-merger-301154274.html)
* r/WSB's favorite hedgie, Steven A. Cohen, bought up 16.4% of this stock on March 1st through Point72 Asset Management, L.P., Point72 Capital Advisors, Inc., Cubist Systematic Strategies, LLC, and through himself.

* For what it's worth, a post in r/SPACs shows that PAYA is one of Franklin Templton's 7 PIPEs and they don't seem to miss...that bad.

* Analysts Price Targets are anywhere from $15-$18 over the next 12 months with a 2 of those coming in over the past week

BTIG's Mark Palmer on his $18 Target Price:

&gt;BTIG Sees Paya Holdings (PAYA) as a Takeout Candidate, PT Raised to $18  
&gt;  
&gt;2 months ago  
&gt;  
&gt;The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the belief that this could put smaller payments and commerce technology providers such as PAYA in play. He stated ""While we view PAYA, which remains on pace to generate almost $40bn of transaction volume in 2021, as a compelling stand-alone story given its strong prospects for growing sales of bundled software and payments to \~100K middle-market customers in underpenetrated verticals, we believe its attractiveness as a takeout target should be supportive of its valuation"".

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - 16-April-21 $15 Calls had unusual activity today and I got bored so I wrote this to convince myself to buy them.**

Interested to see if anyone has insight/thoughts regarding the Options activity and Cohen's recent purchase. This was my first time doing this sort of thing, but really would like to discuss something other than meme stocks for a bit.

*Disclaimer: I was an art major, not a chance in hell I'm a financial advisor and you should proceed at your own risk.*

**EDIT:** Was asked to share activity from Wednesday, March 3rd (aka today), I posted it below. Again, I merely wanted to point out something I found interesting.

I got some really good feedback last Friday when I put my first post in here regarding a Put option I had purchased on SPY (MAR 19, 387 Put).  I also got a fair number of people telling me I was an idiot.  Here is an update on the position.  I purchased the option on 2/26 for 9.55.  It closed the day up 27% as SPY breached the lower support of a rising wedge (not triangle) pattern.  I got smacked down pretty hard on Monday as SPY traded back into the wedge, but I argued that SPY continued putting in lower highs and lower lows.  Unless it broke above the former lower high (392.23), I was going to ride it out.  Since Monday, SPY has traded back below the lower support of the wedge and the 9-day EMA has crossed below the 20-day EMA.  With today's action, SPY has broken well below the 50-day EMA and has crossed below it's lower Bollinger Band.  The option is trading at $17.52 as I write this (an 83% gain from my entry point).  I am not seeing any positive divergence on the 15-minute or daily charts indicating the downside may not be over.  That said, with SPY trading below its lower Bollinger Band, there is the possibility of a bounce which does seem to be happening.  I think I am going to close my position now and wait for a bounce before I look for a re-entry point.  A future downside target may be 368.27 (January's end of month low).  If that is breached, the 200-day EXP is currently sitting on about 350.",1,SPY Downside Play - Update,66.0,0.92,"SPY Downside Play - Update &amp;#x200B;

*Notes on positions:*

No new tickers since my last post.

**Updates:** 

I woke up to an automated text this morning sent from Tastytrade requesting a maintenance call. That’s when I knew today was going to be bloody (Remember kiddos, keep a nice buffer of BP if you have short positions open).

I have been excited to submit my first **red day** post in this series, namely to give a reality check to the very few newbies here who might need one (my last couple posts drew in quite a number of DMs from redditors; I wonder how many will DM me after reading this semi-loss-porn post haha). I don’t intend on posting journal entries on back-to-back days but I couldn’t resist, with all the blood in the streets. At its lowest point today, my portfolio was **down 12%** and eventually closed at down 5.8%. What did that mean for me, though? *More gamma gain opportunities!*

First, I had to take care of business re: maintenance call by closing some positions, and I decided to do so by closing out $SNPR shares, a $CCIV short put, and a $SNPR short put, all at tiny profits. 

Secondly, I took a redditor’s reply in my last post very seriously and decided that if I believe in Cathy Wood (and, oh, do I!), I should just allocate a significant portion of my portfolio to calls in $ARKF and maybe $ARKK. This is also in-line with the “buy red-day arks” plan I noted in my last post (and in-line with rule #4 in my first post). So, I offloaded more $IPOE July losers and rerouted those funds into the arks. My $ARKF expiries are further out than Gamma Gang would’ve probably liked, but I think the dates befit a slow gainer like $ARKF.

Thirdly, I opened a calendar call debit spread on $CCIV as I said I would to protect against any more upside swings. It’s kind of working; IV% is higher at the closer expiry than it is at my furthest one, though, so the position looked stupid throughout the day.

**Plans:**

* I’m happy with my concentration in $IPOE and will continue to resist the strong urge to BTFD. 

* $CCIV continues to confound me, in my head anyway. Yes, I’m up on the position, but this seems like an opportunity ripe for the taking, as they say, and I’m unsure how to continue going about it. **Would welcome any suggestions here.**

* My whale-chasing experiment with $MOS isn’t doing so hot. But instead of closing to salvage the pitiful remainder of ~$33, I’ll just let it ride to expiry and see what happens. I’d like to think that if those jobless claims this morning didn’t tank the market, this bet would’ve paid off ($MOS beat earnings and guidance is positive). *Huge* maybe, even then.

* I will try my darndest not to collect profits too early on my arks. This would actually go against one of my own unwritten rules, but I have aggressive goals to meet and staying the course might be the wisest choice here. 

* I plan on trimming my portfolio soonish. I have been doing a lot of experimentation with different strategies and have touched a lot of tickers as a result of it. 

**Random Thoughts:**

* The only gainer on my watchlist that beat VIX (@ 5.86% at its highest) was $CCIV (a stupid 6.45% at its highest). 

* I also made an intra-day $SPY play (not pictured) on an OTM call to experiment with the “NOPE indicator” (google if interested). Cool test, made out with 64% profit (a limit order filled while I was on a work call; if I was more attentive I probably would’ve just let it ride). Might do it again some time with a bigger stack. Just know that this was a sample size of 1. 

* If you believe in the Buffet Indicator, we find ourselves in [very scary unchartered waters](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-buffett-indicator-at-all-time-highs-is-this-cause-for-concern/).

sinocommas,0.0,63.0,"Hi all,

I’m mostly a lurker, but decided to share some DD on a company that I believe will have massive returns in less than a month and in the long term. Not sure how these usually go, but here’s my analysis:

Company - CRMD - CorMedix

[Website](https://www.cormedix.com)

$14.10 on 2/9 close

They are a small cap ($430m) Pharma company whose antibacterial catheter for hemodialysis patients has a PDUFA review on February 28th. 

Note: 

CRBSI - catheter-related bloodstream infection 


Description:

a biopharmaceutical company, focuses on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases in the United States and internationally. It primarily focuses on the development of its lead product candidate, Neutrolin, an anti-infective solution for the reduction and prevention of catheter-related infections and thrombosis in patients requiring central venous catheters in clinical settings, such as hemodialysis, critical/intensive care, and oncology. 


Product:

Defencath is a proprietary formulation of taurolidine 1.35%, citrate 3.5% and heparin 1,000 units/mL to reduce the risk of infections from in-dwelling catheters. The key compound in Defencath, taurolidine, is an amino acid derivative with in-vitro studies indicating broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including antibiotic resistant strains, as well as mycobacteria and clinically relevant fungi including Aspergillus.


Phase III Trial:

CorMedix completed its Phase 3 clinical study of Defencath, known as LOCK-IT-100. The primary objective of the randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel-arm, clinical trial was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Defencath as a catheter lock solution (""CLS"") for prevention of CRBSI in subjects receiving HD for the treatment of ESRD when compared with heparin. The trial was terminated in August 2018 following the recommendation of the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), because efficacy had been demonstrated and the pre-specified level of statistical significance had been achieved with no safety concerns. CorMedix announced the top-line results from the interim analysis of the study in January 2019 with efficacy data from 653 subjects at the time of the interim analysis, including the first 28 cases of CRBSI. The study continued enrolling and treating subjects until study termination, so the final efficacy analysis was based on a total of 795 subjects.


Efficacy: 

In the analysis of the full data set, a total of 41 CRBSI events was determined by the Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC). There was a 71% reduction in the risk of occurrence of CRBSIs compared with the active control of heparin, which is well in excess of the study's assumed treatment effect size of a 55% reduction. In the Defencath arm, the CRBSI event rate was 0.13 per 1,000 catheter days, which is significantly lower than the event rate of 0.46 per 1,000 catheter days in the control arm. The statistical significance of the primary endpoint in the full data set (p=0.0006) was even more impressive than that of the interim analysis (p=0.0034).


Market:

An estimated 250,000 CRBSIs occur annually in the U.S. CorMedix found over 180 extensive interviews with nephrologists, oncologists, and total parenteral nutrition healthcare providers that a significant unmet need in addressing CRBSIs existed.


Competition:

None. Currently, there are no pharmacological agents approved in the U.S. for the prevention of CRBSIs. Defencath was granted Fast Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designations in 2015.


Financials:

As of 2020 they are operating at a loss, which has declined for the last three consecutive years (2017 -$33m, 2018 -$27m, 2019 -$16m). Analysts expect the company’s final loss to be this year, with profitability starting in 2022 (+$21m). 

MOST IMPORTANTLY: they have ZERO DEBT on their balance sheet. Which among loss-making pharma is extremely rare. 


Price Targets:

Within the last two weeks, two analysts raised their price targets:

$35 from $20 - Truist Securities
$25 from $11 - B. Reilly 


Why care? 

On February 28th, their product Defencath has a PDUFA review. Now, I’m not usually one to make investments based on whether the FDA passes or fails a drug, but I think this is a clear winner. Defencath was accepted for priority review on 8/31/20 which is given to drugs or products that offer major advances in treatment or a provide treatment where no adequate therapy exists (they would be the latter). On 11/7/20, the FDA canceled a review meeting for discussion and follow up questions - this is a huge indicator of good things to come. 


Long Term:

If my hypothesis is correct and they the FDA passes Defencath, there is significant room for growth. In addition to the normal 5 year exclusivity, they will have an additional 5 years of marketing exclusivity as it is classified as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product. CorMedix also intends to develop Defencath as a catheter lock solution for use in oncology and total parenteral nutrition patients. It is leveraging its taurolidine technology to develop a pipeline of antimicrobial medical devices, with programs in surgical sutures and meshes, and topical hydrogels. This increases their market 10-fold. 

At the end of the day, there is always the possibility that things can go awry, but I believe the odds are in favor of FDA approval. This is not financial advice.

Defencath was accepted for priority review on 8/31/20 which is given to drugs or products that offer major advances in treatment or a provide treatment where no adequate therapy exists (they would be the latter). On 11/7/20, the FDA canceled a review meeting for discussion and follow up questions - this is a huge indicator of good things to come. 


Long Term:

If my hypothesis is correct and they the FDA passes Defencath, there is significant room for growth. In addition to the normal 5 year exclusivity, they will have an additional 5 years of marketing exclusivity as it is classified as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product. CorMedix also intends to develop Defencath as a catheter lock solution for use in oncology and total parenteral nutrition patients. It is leveraging its taurolidine technology to develop a pipeline of antimicrobial medical devices, with programs in surgical sutures and meshes, and topical hydrogels. This increases their market 10-fold. 

At the end of the day, there is always the possibility that things can go awry, but I believe the odds are in favor of FDA approval. This is not financial advice.

My plan of action was to close out some backwards options positions that were short - mid term. The thought was if the market continues down or sideways for the remainder of the week, these positions would be more backwards in 3-7 days. I raised the capital and moved it over to long term hedges on the XLK and SMH as well as dollar cost averaging into more of my long term plays - specifically ARK LEAPS.

INTRO

Hello! Below you can find my DD for Callaway Golf, $ELY. Shameless plug before we get going, I have started a subreddit community at r/StocksAndBlocks where I hope to build more DD and analysis over various stocks and crypto. So if you like this, join that.

Let's dig in.

OVERVIEW

Callaway is one of the leading names in the golf industry. They are a market leader in golf clubs, number two in golf balls, sponsor some of the largest names on the PGA tour, and tap into several revenue streams with golf equipment, clothing, and potentially recreation if their merger with Top Golf completes as is expected. While the stock low of $4.75 in March of 2020 has long passed, coupled with the recent all time high of $32.59 in February of 2021, this still profiles as a strong long-term hold stock in the coming years.

WHY IS THIS A VALUE?

In the recent Callaway Earnings Call in Feb 2021, board members including CEO Oliver ""Chip"" Brewer were ecstatic about the ""impressive growth"" golf has witnessed during the time period Covid screeched many other leisure outlets to a halt.

Callaway works to have something for golfers at every stage of the market. Their Strata series is often a go-to for newer golfers, with a durable, well made product tailored for those deciding if the hobby is fun enough for a larger investment.

There was a 41% increase YOY in 4Q for rounds played, contributing to the 14% overall increase during 2020 as a whole. Covid or not, people were golfing.

Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow, $ELE has seen a 108% increase from $303M in 2019 to $632M at the end of 2020 in available liquidity. They will use this to invest in multiple revenue streams including Top Golf which is covered below.

FY21 is expected to be around pre-covid numbers for gross margin as the brand continues improving from the pandemic. The company is also #1 in Hard Goods in both Japan and Europe, and is considered the #1 club brand in the U.S. It's golf ball trails shortly behind Titleist but still owns roughly 17% of the market, or 1-in-5 golfers.

REVENUE STREAMS

When those new golfers, coupled with the continued influx of baby boomers retiring are ready for their new and improved set of clubs, Callaway has top of the line products to provide across all revenue streams. Not only do they create premium drivers, irons, and putters (Odyssey), they also tap in with golf balls, leisure and outdoor clothing (Travis Mathew, Jack Wolfskin), performance apparel and training equipment. While Callaway and other golf retailers are confident in meeting demands, the industry itself is holding all time low levels of inventory. The game is booming.

The company saw a NON-GAAP 4Q increase of $14 million to $162M total, but this was due mainly to increasing employee pay, catering to increased demand of product, and working to prepare the launch of several revenue streams like Travis Mathew retail stores.

Callaway finds a customer committed to playing the game. Provides options for a starter set or top of the line clubs, clothing, golf balls, etc. and also sponsors several pros like Phil Mickelson and John Rahm to show you just what their product can do on the tour.

This level of synergy had CEO Brewer boasting in the recent earnings call about the ""Largest golf consumer ecosystem in the world.""

And that is all without mentioning the likely merger with Top Golf which will be voted on with likely success March 3.

TOP GOLF MERGER

What is Top Golf?

Imagine an arcade-style driving range where 50% of the customers do not even consider themselves golfers. It captures all demographics from enthusiasts of the game to the group of friends who want to drink at a bar while cranking some drives. It is home to Top Tracer technology which helps track golf shots and provides feedback. Top Golf installs these Top Tracer systems into hundreds of driving bays across the country on top of housing at Top Golf itself, providing monthly income to the company through renting the service.

With over 50 locations in operation across multiple countries, Callaway has been involved with Top Golf since 2006, owning 14% of the company. A merger was announced in October 2020 and is expected to be voted on and approved on March 3.

Top Golf itself is valued at around $2.5 Billion dollars, but carries with it around half a billion in debt. This appears to be of little concern to Callaway, who is flush with cash and sees the potential revenue streams created by owning a highly successful arcade driving range.

Equipment costs and inventory concerns will be lowered even further for Callaway as it can not only supply product used during Top Golf sessions, but sell products for consumers to take home if they decide to pick up the game on actual courses.

The earnings call mentioned the excitement surrounding the merger, but did not go heavily into financial details. They were very conservative with their outlook and worked hard not to speculate, especially considering the current pandemic and its issues. All that said, you can't understate the potential impact this will have on the company.

INVENTORY

Inventory is down overall across golf due to a ""robust demand"" across the total industry inventory. Inventory in the field for 5.2 months last year. 2.2 inventory this december 2020. Entire industry will ""be in chase mode, our inventory in the field is slightly below the industry average"" and is a ""reflection on unprecedented demand.""

Callaway is once again in a prime position to capitalize on this. The company has heavily invested in ecommerce, and is doing a fantastic job of capturing the digital market as well as the second hand club market with its website CallawayPreOwned.com

With the addition of Top Tracer technology inside Callaway shops, more custom fitted clubs and less bulk inventory can be expected as well as Callaway capitalizes on the data to save money at the bottom line.

COMPETITION

Callaway's market cap is 2.82B despite a fairly low volume average of 1.8M per session. Acushnet (Titleist) is slightly higher at a 3B market cap, and Ping are among Callaway's competitors.

TaylorMade is another competitor of Callaway after being sold for $425M by Adidas in 2017. TaylorMade is up for sale once again and is projected to be had for around $2 Billion dollars.

For TaylorMade to X5 in Value over the course of a few years, it speaks to the potential that a long standing brand like Callaway brings to the table (and don't forget Top Golf!).

STOCK ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION

Obligatory mention that I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research. Not suggesting to buy literally anything at all.

After a quick look at the chart and using my background knowledge of golf, I felt that Callaway was a solid value at 28-30 bucks a share given where the game is now. This was before I learned of the pending Top Golf merger. Capturing that base of potential customers, selling equipment and clothing to existing customers, and access to the toptracer technology, this feels like an extremely strong long term investment.

Feel free to do your own digging for analysts you trust, I am not even linking them here to encourage that. From the areas I trust, as well as digging around I did elsewhere, this stock could see a few bucks in short term growth and really see some movement with a long term hold.

I personally own a position I plan to add on soon, but I do not intend to part with these shares for a couple years. I have gathered information I am comfortable investing with in shares and I am not confident in playing options at this time.

With the addition of Top Tracer technology inside Callaway shops, more custom fitted clubs and less bulk inventory can be expected as well as Callaway capitalizes on the data to save money at the bottom line.

COMPETITION

Callaway's market cap is 2.82B despite a fairly low volume average of 1.8M per session. Acushnet (Titleist) is slightly higher at a 3B market cap, and Ping are among Callaway's competitors.

TaylorMade is another competitor of Callaway after being sold for $425M by Adidas in 2017. TaylorMade is up for sale once again and is projected to be had for around $2 Billion dollars.

For TaylorMade to X5 in Value over the course of a few years, it speaks to the potential that a long standing brand like Callaway brings to the table (and don't forget Top Golf!).

STOCK ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION

Obligatory mention that I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research. Not suggesting to buy literally anything at all.

After a quick look at the chart and using my background knowledge of golf, I felt that Callaway was a solid value at 28-30 bucks a share given where the game is now. This was before I learned of the pending Top Golf merger. Capturing that base of potential customers, selling equipment and clothing to existing customers, and access to the toptracer technology, this feels like an extremely strong long term investment.

Feel free to do your own digging for analysts you trust, I am not even linking them here to encourage that. From the areas I trust, as well as digging around I did elsewhere, this stock could see a few bucks in short term growth and really see some movement with a long term hold.

I personally own a position I plan to add on soon, but I do not intend to part with these shares for a couple years. I have gathered information I am comfortable investing with in shares and I am not confident in playing options at this time.

prostockadvice,0.0,53.0,"Looks like buying the dip finally paid off. We are technically still in the middle of a dip, even though the markets are going back up, so I will keep buying. The tech and growth stocks are still on sale, especially the Ark Invest ETFs. Long term these will pay, and we didn't see a pullback like this since the end of October 2020. I'm trying my best to dollar cost average into more Ark LEAPS. This is not a crash if you haven't figured it out yet, but it is a transition from growth tech stocks into stocks that will perform well and benefit most from a recovery. Today let's take a look at some companies that are poised to do well from the economy opening back up. It is not to late to get into most of these; the giant is waking up.

$AKKF was down a decent amount at one point and I tried DCA another contract. Also, picked up an $AMZN condor which is already up 10%. If you are interested this only cost $800 and has potential to pay $3700 if it stay relatively flat, which Amazon has been doing for a while!

$**V**: All of the credit card companies would most likely benefit from and opening of the economy and shoppers going out into the world and spending money again. Not to mention if employment goes up, so should these. This is a more of a long term play, at minimum I'd do LEAPS with a strike of mid $200s.

$**MAR**: Marriot International or any major hotel chains also have a economic recovery catalyst and have been taking off in the last few days. The money has transitioned into these 'recovery' stocks already, but I don't think it is to late. I will wait for a pull back and buy on support.

$**RCL** : Royal Caribbean or any major cruise line, take your pick. If you recall this sector is one of the hardest hit by Covid-19, so in theory they should have the biggest growth when the economy is 'going back to normal'. Keep in mind, these are coming off of some big pushes towards the target prices in the past week, therefore I personally am not in a rush to buy them but it is more of a confirmation that when it does drop to support its an excellent buy.

$**CAT**: We had called out Caterpillar toward the end of last month as a good buy and sure enough it hit the support and pushed up a decent amount. Not only do they have autonomous vehicles but they have exposure to oil - which is up this week. I'm having to adjust the target and entry as $CAT hit our target today.

Amateur options trader here, looking for some insight on why my puts dropped in value after a 20% decrease in share price. So I bought Watt puts on Friday when they went up 90%.

I did some research and it seems what most likely happened was IV crush, which basically means interest in the stock dropped significantly and IV crush deteriorates the value of all options across the board.

1) is there an IV ""cutoff"" where you say this is too much premium?
2) would buying shares or doing a more complex spread (ie selling puts) be a better play?

_PutCallTheta,0.0,50.0,"Hi everyone,

I am beta testing an options strategy simulation site I am working on at [https://putcalltheta.com](https://putcalltheta.com), I would like to get some feedback from the community.

This was a lockdown project that started out as a tool for personal use. I decided to make it public as it could be a useful resource for folks who need something similar or a web-based alternative.

The motivation for this site is to have a tool for exploring ways of managing strategies as a stock price changes; for example how to manage a position when the market moves against one. Another motivation was to look at strategies that include a time element i.e. legging in or out as a stock price changes. Doing all these simulations historical options prices rather than theoretical prices.

The site is currently **desktop only** \- sorry mobile users. I like to see a lot of information on the screen at the same time. I am still trying to work out the best mobile design that does not involve a lot of scrolling.

When complete the full version will include:

* More curated markets and monthly updates; users can request for symbols to be added.
* Saving simulations to resume later or to replay. The replays can be made public and shared.
* Adding notes/annotations to the charts
* Other suggested features from the Beta testing.

There will a feature limited free version. While the full featured version will be no more than $24.99 a year - need to pay for hosting, bandwidth, and options data.

Thanks

I'm considering an option trade, but I'm having trouble with the difference between buying vs selling a call option. And since people will ask, it's for $AMC. I currently have 24 @ $9.01, and I want to increase my position and hopefully turn a profit on it.

Vega is the change in an option’s price due to changes in implied  volatility (IV), which reflects the market’s expected change in the  price of the underlying.  When big news is expected, IV usually climbs,  as traders don’t know where the price will end up.  After the news  breaks and perhaps a big move in the underlying, the price is expected  to settle down, so volatility shrinks. Vega describes how this change in  IV changes the price of an option. Because vega involves a change in IV, we can think of it as comparing  two different IVs, one now and some new IV in the future.  It’s  important to realize that IV is a description of how much extrinsic  value (EV) is in an option’s price, so vega is really describing the  increase or decrease of EV. Let’s say a stock is trading at $500 and you’re looking at options for  45 DTE.  The IV is at 20%, so let’s use the Black-Scholes Model to  calculate the EV in the options at each strike price. (I’m ignoring the  risk-free rate and dividend yield to keep it simple.)  The EV at the  money (ATM) is $14.  Everywhere else, it’s less.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fmf6gc7h95h61.jpg?width=1017&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d73addcb25a09da34e845d84e9dc1c2df9188f99

The orange line shows the EV as it is with IV at 20%.  But what if IV  doubled to 40%? The blue triangle shows us.  The gray line is IV at 10%,  half that of the orange. Simplifying a lot, vega can be thought of as the vertical distance  between these graphs. If IV grows, the triangle gets taller because EV  grew. Vega is the rate that this triangle changes height as IV changes.  Notice that the blue peak is at $28, exactly double the orange peak.   The gray peak is only $7, exactly half that of the orange peak.  Simple,  right? The relationship is linear. Double the IV, double the EV. But if you look carefully, you’ll see that that’s only true exactly ATM.  Everywhere else, it’s not a 1-to-1 ratio. The triangle didn’t just get  taller, it also got wider.  See here:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xhss5dkj95h61.jpg?width=642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03391a7e28b41190936d316f8b530a41cbdaeba6

Each connected circle is not only twice as high as the previous one, but  also twice as far from the center. At 10% IV, the $10 OTM call (510) is  worth $3.17.  At 20% IV, the $20 OTM call (520) is worth $6.46…barely  more than double. At 40% IV, the $40 OTM call (540) is worth  $13.37…barely more than double.  Calls are a little more than double,  puts are a little less than double. The reason has to do with how much  capital the option “controls” at the different strikes, plus there’s a  logarithmic probability distribution involved… y’know what, don’t worry  about it. Just remember this nice rule of thumb:   For any strike x% OTM with price $y at IV=z, if volatility goes to 2z,  then EV will be 2y at a strike 2x% OTM. That is, “twice the IV = twice  the price, twice as far OTM. Half the IV, half the price, half as far  OTM.” But what about at a constant strike? At the 470 strike, EV at 20% IV is  $3.54, but at 40%, it’s $14.74. That’s not double, that’s more than  triple!  At 10% IV, it’s only $0.27 in EV, which is just 7% of the  IV=20% value.  Let’s graph that for each strike.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cof288nl95h61.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f606aac6ba8bfa4c5a8e16eece8c17521e47188

Notice the axis here.  It’s log2, so every line is “double/half” the  adjacent one.  This chart is almost the inverse of the first one.   Instead of a triangle pointing up with concave slopes, the doubled IV is  now pointing down with convex slopes.  At the money, there’s the  smallest change as a ratio of former EV, whereas on the previous chart,  we saw ATM have the highest absolute change. Now compare the orange to the gray.  ATM, doubling the IV doubles the EV  (2:1 ratio), while halving the IV halves the EV (1:2 ratio).  But  everywhere else, that ratio is not a perfect inverse.  Notice that at  450, doubling the IV makes EV go up roughly 8 times (2\^3), but halving  it makes it go down roughly 1/128 (2\^-7). Let’s graph the ratio between  doubling and halving the IV for each strike:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4cbevb0a5h61.jpg?width=951&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87547d7dba0e253072eaa57a4a1f4ece3dfb4661

Another curving triangle! Again, note the log2 axis.  The father OTM you  go, the greater the discrepancy between IV \* x and IV / x.  We saw why already. When IV goes up, strikes that used to be considered near impossible to reach suddenly become more probable.  From that point on,  those formerly-impossible strikes act more like a strike near the money.  That is, when volatility spikes, deep OTM strikes seem like near-ATM  strikes. Think of it as if after volatility shoots up, “450 is the new  475.”  If volatility doubles and the 450 strike’s EV goes up 8-fold,  then should volatility halve again, it won’t fall 1/128th like you see  on the gray line in the second chart. Instead, it’ll act more like the  475 would, and only fall 1/8th back to its original value.

This phenomenon of far strikes becoming close strikes when volatility spikes is quantified in a second-order Greek called Vanna, which is a  post for another time. So keep these charts in mind’s eye when you’re looking at IV and  considering how it might change. Think of triangles of EV growing up and  out, or shrinking down and in.  Vega describes the gap between  triangles at each strike. The biggest gaps are from peak to peak, but  the biggest percentage change is at the edges.  The deeper OTM, the  bigger the difference between IV increasing by some fraction and  decreasing by that same fraction.

https://preview.redd.it/w79ivyvd95h61.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee75958298dcc9a1ede25596a7b08015d4e2be0e

Vega is the change in an option’s price due to changes in implied  volatility (IV), which reflects the market’s expected change in the  price of the underlying.  When big news is expected, IV usually climbs,  as traders don’t know where the price will end up.  After the news  breaks and perhaps a big move in the underlying, the price is expected  to settle down, so volatility shrinks. Vega describes how this change in  IV changes the price of an option. Because vega involves a change in IV, we can think of it as comparing  two different IVs, one now and some new IV in the future.  It’s  important to realize that IV is a description of how much extrinsic  value (EV) is in an option’s price, so vega is really describing the  increase or decrease of EV. Let’s say a stock is trading at $500 and you’re looking at options for  45 DTE.  The IV is at 20%, so let’s use the Black-Scholes Model to  calculate the EV in the options at each strike price. (I’m ignoring the  risk-free rate and dividend yield to keep it simple.)  The EV at the  money (ATM) is $14.  Everywhere else, it’s less.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fmf6gc7h95h61.jpg?width=1017&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d73addcb25a09da34e845d84e9dc1c2df9188f99

The orange line shows the EV as it is with IV at 20%.  But what if IV  doubled to 40%? The blue triangle shows us.  The gray line is IV at 10%,  half that of the orange. Simplifying a lot, vega can be thought of as the vertical distance  between these graphs. If IV grows, the triangle gets taller because EV  grew. Vega is the rate that this triangle changes height as IV changes.  Notice that the blue peak is at $28, exactly double the orange peak.   The gray peak is only $7, exactly half that of the orange peak.  Simple,  right? The relationship is linear. Double the IV, double the EV. But if you look carefully, you’ll see that that’s only true exactly ATM.  Everywhere else, it’s not a 1-to-1 ratio. The triangle didn’t just get  taller, it also got wider.  See here:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xhss5dkj95h61.jpg?width=642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03391a7e28b41190936d316f8b530a41cbdaeba6

Each connected circle is not only twice as high as the previous one, but  also twice as far from the center. At 10% IV, the $10 OTM call (510) is  worth $3.17.  At 20% IV, the $20 OTM call (520) is worth $6.46…barely  more than double. At 40% IV, the $40 OTM call (540) is worth  $13.37…barely more than double.  Calls are a little more than double,  puts are a little less than double. The reason has to do with how much  capital the option “controls” at the different strikes, plus there’s a  logarithmic probability distribution involved… y’know what, don’t worry  about it. Just remember this nice rule of thumb:   For any strike x% OTM with price $y at IV=z, if volatility goes to 2z,  then EV will be 2y at a strike 2x% OTM. That is, “twice the IV = twice  the price, twice as far OTM. Half the IV, half the price, half as far  OTM.” But what about at a constant strike? At the 470 strike, EV at 20% IV is  $3.54, but at 40%, it’s $14.74. That’s not double, that’s more than  triple!  At 10% IV, it’s only $0.27 in EV, which is just 7% of the  IV=20% value.  Let’s graph that for each strike.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cof288nl95h61.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f606aac6ba8bfa4c5a8e16eece8c17521e47188

Notice the axis here.  It’s log2, so every line is “double/half” the  adjacent one.  This chart is almost the inverse of the first one.   Instead of a triangle pointing up with concave slopes, the doubled IV is  now pointing down with convex slopes.  At the money, there’s the  smallest change as a ratio of former EV, whereas on the previous chart,  we saw ATM have the highest absolute change. Now compare the orange to the gray.  ATM, doubling the IV doubles the EV  (2:1 ratio), while halving the IV halves the EV (1:2 ratio).  But  everywhere else, that ratio is not a perfect inverse.  Notice that at  450, doubling the IV makes EV go up roughly 8 times (2\^3), but halving  it makes it go down roughly 1/128 (2\^-7). Let’s graph the ratio between  doubling and halving the IV for each strike:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4cbevb0a5h61.jpg?width=951&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87547d7dba0e253072eaa57a4a1f4ece3dfb4661

Another curving triangle! Again, note the log2 axis.  The father OTM you  go, the greater the discrepancy between IV \* x and IV / x.  We saw why already. When IV goes up, strikes that used to be considered near impossible to reach suddenly become more probable.  From that point on,  those formerly-impossible strikes act more like a strike near the money.  That is, when volatility spikes, deep OTM strikes seem like near-ATM  strikes.

Oddsnotinyourfavor,0.0,40.0,"I see a lot of people posting their insane +150% gains and when asked what they’re doing, they say they’re trading weekly credit spreads. While credit spreads are a great strategy, selling them within any time period under 7 days is asking to have your account blown up. Ideally over 14DTE, but under 7DTE is a ticking time bomb waiting to happen.

##The Swings

Credit spreads are for speculating that a price won’t go above/below a certain price, before a chosen expiration date. The problem with 7DTE Credit spreads, is that in order to collect any sort of premium, you realistically have to sell them within 5-7% of the current underlying price. And this is in a semi volatile market. Any stock, even one with a 6.2b float(looking at you NOK) can move 5-7% in a week. 

##Gamma

This ties back into the first point. Gamma significantly increases the last couple days before expiration(especially for ATM options). This means, even if you’re right, if the stock is bouncing close to your short strike price, you’ll likely have an unrealized loss on paper until mere hours before end of day Friday. At which point, you’ll essentially be gambling that the stock doesn’t breach your short strike EOD or in after hours trading. It’s not a fun situation to be in. 

##Everyones a Genius in a Bull Market

I’m sure you’re asking yourself, “why should I be listening to this guy?” And the answer is, you shouldn’t because **THIS ISNT FUCKING FINANCIAL ADVICE**. But if you’re still reading, I’ve been in this position before. I sold weekly credit spreads from Dec 2019-late Feb 2020. Everyone can assume how that went. My point is, a pullback will come, and if you’re selling 7DTE Credit Spreads, you’ll incur a 40% loss before you even have time to react. 

##The Solution

It would be a waste of a post if I didn’t recommend some sort of alternative. So my recommendation is just simply selling credit spreads 21-45DTE. Give yourself some time to breath. If the stock goes against you, you’ll have more time to react and get out for way less than 7DTE. 

Edit: Though some of you in the comments have seen success, you also have strict risk management plans in place to protect your ass.

KRAndrews,0.0,33.0,"WKHS is it all time highs, and Reddit loves to pump the stock. Me? I was one of the biggest workhorse bulls with hundreds of shares in my portfolio. I rode the wave until today, where I sold the last of my shares. So... why?

Well, **90% of this company‘s value is based on them getting the USPS deal. People love to think the company is a shoe in for the USPS deal, but that’s simply not the case.**

For starters, the Biden administration doesn’t have nearly as much control over the United States Postal Service as you think. See:
https://twitter.com/bradplumer/status/1354831900939079680?s=20

Even if Biden‘s number one goal was for the USPS to go all electric, he’d have to move hell and earth to have any control over that happening. And, with the contract supposedly being decided by the end of March, there simply isn’t enough time to do that.

But it gets even worse. People say “well, workhorse is the only all electric option, so at least it has that going for it.“ To that, I Bring you a conversation an analyst had with Oshkosh:

&gt; “Your bid is based on the Ford's transit, I believe. And we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021. For your comment that you can address whatever the USPS' needs are as far as powertrain, is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit? Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?”

Oshkosh’s reply: 

&gt; “So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.”

In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special. 

Let’s get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed). **Buy WKHS Puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you’re brave like me, calls expiring in April.**

geoffreygonzale,0.0,35.0,"hi guys. i’ve been day trading options for a couple weeks, been doing rather well. 

have 2 questions :

1) been going with itm calls / otm puts as my default, trying to get the highest delta while balancing bid ask and volume. i only hold positions for a couple minutes generally, and never overnight.

let’s say i have 1k to spend on either 1x deep itm call, or 5x otm calls right out of the money. which has more leverage?

the itm system has been working for me so far. but i keep reading / watching stuff that says multiple otm calls have more leverage than a single itm when spending the same amount

2) been experimenting with selling calls / puts at market open and riding the trend until correction, which normally only lasts 5min. this has been way more profitable than buying calls / puts at open. i assume this is from iv crush.

in the situation of selling calls and spending an equal amount of money, what would yield a higher return : selling multiple otm calls, or one itm call?

all these situations assume the same expiry. yes i know options are high risk. yes i take small positions relative to my portfolio

thank you

edit edit edit :

more experimenting.
for selling calls, it seems that selling multiple OTM calls will also give you the maximum leverage when the price moves in your favor, just like buying calls.
this also is the case when selling puts, in which case you will sell multiple ITM calls

it seems that there is a sweet spot of leverage for OTM calls or ITM puts. sometimes its 5% OTM and sometimes its 100% OTM. but, go too fa and the leverage curve starts to fall off and you get less leverage.

am now looking for an app that can calculate this on the fly. for now could use optionsprofitcalculator.com and note which strike generates the most leverage on the upside and the downside, before market opens, or during when there is a lull. but that is too tedious for me, if im watching a dozen or so tickers


the other unknown i would like to test next week is if buying at the sweetspot deep OTM calls is ACTUALLY more profitable than a single deep ITM in practice, as there may be issues with iv being multiplied with multiple calls

edit edit edit edit :

yeah i’m gonna continue to go with selling itm calls (and otm puts). 

selling multiple otm calls (or itm puts) ties up a significant chunk of capital for the day, that do not get released until the day after you cover. i would rather take the more modest leverage and have more capital free for moves. 

selling multiple otm call also takes forever to fill. so overall it not really maximizing profit, as waiting and having to chase bid ask spread is money down the drain 

also, i would have to sell a butt ton of them to make any significant money. let’s say they’re .20-.30, that’s definitely definitely not enough hahah. realistically cant expect to sell a couple hundred of these AND get a fill AND get good bid ask spread.

Just wanted to share some tickers to keep an eye on this week in case you didn't already have some in mind. Webull premarket opens in a little less than 30 mins from now so that should be enough time to read through the notes and keep an eye on what the price action does once trading starts.  


I'll include the notes below along with the link to the Google Doc file and the link to the live stream video we did ~~earlier~~ yesterday. The video is pretty long, but the order of the tickers in the notes match the order that they were covered in the video. If you skim through from start to finish, you'll be able to find the appropriate part where the particular ticker was covered.  


 **Plays For The Upcoming Week (Feb 16-19 2021)**

  
Note: The tickers with asterisks before them are the plays that I really like.

**$PSTH:** daily looked like it wasn’t in a good spot, but the 4hr looks amazing! Currently above the support level around the $32.70-33.00 area. Need to watch PM and see which direction we head since we’re in the middle of the fib levels. If it gaps up, look to see if it can reclaim the $33.56 level. If not, it’ll likely fall to the $32-33 support mentioned earlier. That’s what I’m leaning towards the most. If we fall to the support line and bounce up from there, target is $33.50-$34.00. Conservative target I’d put around $33. Keep in mind this is a slow mover, so you’ll have to be patient and go with a decent exp (if playing options) for safety.

**$HEC:** rejecting off resistance of the bull flag it’s trading within on the 4hr. If it falls, look for $11.70, 11.50, or $11.30 (worst case scenario) as your support levels. These are based on the horizontal and uptrend support lines. Like mentioned earlier, it’s been trading within a bull flag (bullish pattern) the past week so we’re overall bullish, we just need to see how far down it goes before getting in. Needs to break and hold $12.00-12.15 to go long but if it does, PT’s at $12.45 &gt; $12.90 (all time highs). Another slow mover.

**$MAXR:** trading alone steady uptrend on daily and 4hr. Daily looked like a bad play, but the 4hr looks a lot better. Currently holding above $50, if it stays there and shows strength we'll see $51.50 &gt; 53.31 &gt; high $54's. If it falls, we'll see $49 &gt; $48 &gt; high $47's as your support levels.

**$THCB:** holding well above $19.45, great entry if it holds, lining up with the 200ema on the intraday as well (double support confirmation). Look to see what it does during PM. If it gaps up, targets are $21 &gt; high $21's &gt; high $22's &gt; high $23's &gt; low $25's as resistances. If it falls, look for $18.50 &gt; mid to high $17's &gt; low $17’s which will likely be at or near the 200 ema by then.

**$PLTR:** trading within a HUGE wedge and showing support around the mid $31 to $32 range, looking pretty bullish atm, but keep in mind earnings are tomorrow morning PM and lock up exp date is this Thursday. Short term bullish target is high $33's to high $35. Conservative price target is high $32's. If we fall from the current price, look for high $31’s to high $30’s as support levels. Could also fall down lower to the 200 ema which will likely be around the high $29 to low $30 range.

**\***  **$DDD:** currently making a healthy pullback on the daily chart, but still holding well above the 9 ema ($47.50), the 13 ema ($45.14), and the support levels between high $46's and high $45’s. If we continue this momentum, targets are $50 &gt; $53 &gt; $55 &gt; mid $56 (ATH). Conservative target would be $49-51.

Bonus DDD Options Trade Idea: DDD Call, $55 Strike, March 5 exp, entry at $400 or lower (wait for PM price action to see what the price is doing and will do at open to determine your entry for the call)

**$FVRR:** Currently at ATH's so a little risky trying to play this, however, the 1hr chart shows a little consolidation of candles near the top to see where potential support and resistance might be. Ideally, you’d want it to pullback a bit and hold one of the support levels ($324 next support from current price of $330) to confirm it’s steady at those price levels. If it falls, holds at the $324 level and shows strength, it could be a good entry then I’d set a target of $330. If shooting for higher ATH, shoot for $327 (fib extension tool level). If it falls, look for $312 (next key support after $324)

\*  **$ADPT:** If it breaks $66.50 and holds above there, that's the breakout confirmation of your bullish pennant. I wouldn’t be surprised if it falls a bit to the high $65's or worst case, to high $64's, but even if it does, that's still within the Cup &amp; Handle pattern (bullish) on the 4hr chart. Super bullish on this setup. Setting a target of $71 (best case) &gt; $70 (next best), $66-67 as my conservative targets

**\***  **$IDEX:** currently showing strength above high $4's. If it holds that look for $4.87 &gt; $5 &gt; $5.19. This is looking really good as well.

**$AMD:** showing strength and heading up, however, it’s heading towards the resistance area that it rejected down from on multiple occasions (multiple tops = bearish pattern). It will start to struggle along $94 area as that's the key resistance, but if it breaks and holds that, we'll see $95.50, If it breaks and holds that, look for $99 but be careful as that's ATH resistance that was hit three times already in the past.

**\* $PLUG:** trading within bullish pennant on daily, with diverging volume (bullish pattern + signs of momentum). If we gap up, see if it holds and shows strength around high $64's. If it breaks and holds that, look for $67.50, then high $69's. If we gap down, look to enter between $63 to $60.50 (the key support levels and uptrending support/bottom of bullish pennant fall within that range). It should find support between there somewhere, but if it doesn’t just scrap that bullish pennant play as that will be the point at which it falls out and under the pennant (no longer a valid pattern to trade). Should take a short/bearish positions at that point.

**5G Outlook**

QCOM will be the leader in 5G technology until at least the next generation chips. 5G adoption has [been much faster than 4G](https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-5g-2022-750-million/). In 2019, 5G market revenue was $0.71B in 2020 it had increased to $2.56B with 2021 [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1006994/5g-market-revenue-worldwide/) around $5.4B and $8.75B in 2022. QCOM reported $6.5B earnings in Q4 beating estimations averaging $5.93B, for a 35% YoY increase. The CEO directly stated this was due to 5G.

**Competition**

With their multi year agreement with Apple and the success of the Snapdragon X60 5G in the iPhone 12, it seems like Apple will be sticking with QCOM modems for the near future. I say the near future because Apple’s acquisition of Intel’s modem division indicates they will begin to develop their own chipset at some point.

There is not much in the space of real threatening competition for QCOM right now. The Chinese phone manufacturer, Huawei, designs its own 5G chips and outsources production through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , but previously offered QCOM chips in its flagship models. This stopped once the trade sanctions were put in place August 2020 (which surprisingly did not result in a hit to the stock even though Huawei is the worlds biggest supplier of 5G phones).  Huawei's only 5G chip, the Kirin 980, is [blown out of the water](https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-875-vs-hisilicon-kirin-980) by QCOMs most recent 5G chip. As of now QCOM only has a [license to sell 4G chips to the Huawei, which is severly limiting their ability to supply smartphones and driving up the prices](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones). When Biden inevitably [lifts the trade restrictions he contested](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1214060.shtml), Huawei will become another massive customer of QCOM and may even follow Apple's lead by abandoning their own chip design for QCOMs superior modems as the defualt modem in their flagship models. The revenue from this should be extensive due to pent up demand.

Samsung has historically produced its own modems but QCOM's Snapdragon 888 seems to work [better in Samsung’s phone than their own newest Exynos 2100](https://www.gsmarena.com/exynos_2100_vs_snapdragon_888_sustained_performance_and_throttling_on_the_samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_v-news-47769.php) and you can currently buy the phone with [either chip](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/samsung-fans-have-had-it-with-exynos-processors). There is increasing pressure for Samsung to follow suit with apple and almost all other android smartphones and transition entirely to QCOM modems.

QCOM has a ridiculous [patent portfolio](https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/qroniclesofinvention/index.html) and tons of high performing low cost 5G chips available.

This is likely why it continues to dominate its much smaller competitors such as Skyworks and Broadcom. However, one of the more impressive aspects of the portfolio is the large investment in AI. Almost all modern processors take advantage of AI in some way and this will really set the stage for the future of the industry.

If technology innovation follows its historical pattern, 6G will likely not be commercially available until around 2030 and considering the exponentially increasing patent portfolio due to reinvestment in R&amp;D by QCOM, it could be a leader in this as well.

&amp;#x200B;

[Fundamental Analysis of QCOM and Competition \(Purple Estimates are from Yahoo Financial Analysts\)](https://preview.redd.it/7v1s0jbjrcj61.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9555472846e6d11e14ced4186b25b91caa0caba)

QCOM is currently trading at around $137.12 after the recent volatility and I think it is a great opportunity to look at ITM Call options. It is the most affordable of its competition apart from intel which failed to keep Apple and was forced to [exit the modem industry](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/227720-how-intel-lost-10-billion-and-the-mobile-market). It also has by far the best opportunity for growth. I think the Yahoo analyst projection is actually conservative.

There is another manufacturer that some people are claiming is relevant, MediaTek. I completely disagree. While it does have 5G chips, they are abysmal compared to everything else. They have very little scalability because they are a penny stock on TPE.

**Price Prediction**

Looking at the price action excluding the spike from the announcement of the Apple agreement in April 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

[Price action analysis of QCOM ](https://preview.redd.it/rajh6u56ocj61.png?width=1687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73e89cab7db1b5d0ed86106641d41b2b4d8a3236)

It seems likely the price could range from $167.54 in the most bearish case to $258.99 in the most bullish. Giving a heavier weight to the bullish trajectory I believe $225 is a reasonable target at the current rate.

The previous Fibonacci retracement is not comparable due to the onset Covid-19 restrctions and the previous action is not very informative either because there are way too many developments in both the company and market. However, if we assume a retracement back to 0.618 at a price of $125.27 (I think the market will start to turn around due to Powell's testimony).  We should see a bounce late this week or early next week. Since this was a recovery I am expecting a trend reversal around the first Fibonacci extension metric. Which should happen close to year end, in a bullish case it keeps going on to the second metric.

However, since the federal reserve is going to continue to its MMT policies along with the exponential rise in trading, I think 5G companies haven't yet received the attention they could (apart from AVGO), with the S&amp;P sitting at around a 39 average PE, I believe QCOMs PE has a lot of potential for upward movement in this bull market.

If we model QCOMS EPS with a 5th degree polynomial (excluding outliers) to allow for the exponential growth of 5G while hampering growth rate due to slower growth of other aspects of the company, this is the result.

&amp;#x200B;

[Red lines indicate Q1 and Q4 model EPS predictions, the equation of the best fit  polynomial is displayed. The 0.8&amp;#37; Confidence interval is shown as it visually fits the previous data well. ](https://preview.redd.it/8cntgna8ocj61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb9daa431f121e9876350d9c55e2be1be8c0d3e)

This puts the target price after 2021 at $342.45 ***at its current PE***, obviously the uncertainty is massive though and that is mostly due to the recent price action.

Right now Jan 21, 2022 Calls with a $135 strike are $19.50 bid and $20.55 ask. The theta is currently -0.028 and a delta of 0.588 because it is pretty much ATM with a 36.63 IV. The IV has taken a 17% hit due to what looks like a recent correction, however this was mostly due to speculation about monetary policy, and I expect the IV to bounce as demand increases.

[Date Key for Graphs](https://preview.redd.it/y3ugz6f89dj61.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f235f0d720e59f9fb2343771bf8d941cb918e1)

&amp;#x200B;

[IV](https://preview.redd.it/c9dfbfzn8dj61.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa87fac5bc93a8d0edbe059951eebd291c85cffd)

&amp;#x200B;

[Vega](https://preview.redd.it/55yibbwa9dj61.png?width=1126&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ecfac54784eea3fad18e26f0e2de28bf8b81e6)

The vega is at its peak at 0.508 and only slowly declines as the options go ITM while IV sharply rises, I expect a significant premium increase due to this in the rebound.

The gamma is pretty low due to the length of the option and only decreases.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gamma](https://preview.redd.it/7dns6nc0adj61.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eec82bccfcce256cc9f2f36166afbd907e0bcbe)

However, despite this, if we saw a return to last week's price delta would increase to nearly 0.9.

&amp;#x200B;

[Delta](https://preview.redd.it/jdtgd4x9adj61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04554cc43fde2d69a648da5e6e0cbd7b85b4e6f0)

Thetas look relatively stable until you get 2-3 weeks from expiry and deep OTM.  If you shoot for a pre-holiday sell or roll, and you stay at least above 25% OTM, you are looking at about a 40-60% theta hit to the premium. However, following a vega path in this box, you will see a range from 0.2-0.4 average vega, with IV following correspondingly to the intrinsic value, it could see an average of about 45-65. Thus its possible to offset the theta loss with 2.6 (13%) to 11.2 (56%) \[using $20 premium\] which would average to about a 15.5% premium loss. I think this could even be less however because the rebound will likely be soon.

&amp;#x200B;

It is pretty clear that the average delta will be around 0.9 assuming it goes in the right direction.

Assuming the greeks follow the ranges above and selling or rolling at the target, in the most bearish case where it enters and follows the pre-Covid price action we can expect a $167 price which would net around a 229% return for the year. If we move to the next most bearish case (Yahoo Analysts) , this would net a 260% return. I think a 350-600% return is most likely though. It is not unreasonable to humor the possibility of a 1000% return on this investment in just one year.  If this stock begins to get more (deserved) attention and the PE starts to rise due to its real future value, this could be a really amazing trade 1000%+. These numbers seem too good to be true, but I invested heavily and have mostly held and or rolled both Apple and TSLA since 2017 based on similar principles, which adds to my confidence in this investment.

The figure below is a precalculated table of contract values, its pretty close to what I have, it seems like the delta curve it follows is a bit different (maybe a predetermined function and not based on the ticker's delta curve).

**5G Outlook**

QCOM will be the leader in 5G technology until at least the next generation chips. 5G adoption has [been much faster than 4G](https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-5g-2022-750-million/). In 2019, 5G market revenue was $0.71B in 2020 it had increased to $2.56B with 2021 [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1006994/5g-market-revenue-worldwide/) around $5.4B and $8.75B in 2022. QCOM reported $6.5B earnings in Q4 beating estimations averaging $5.93B, for a 35% YoY increase. The CEO directly stated this was due to 5G.

**Competition**

With their multi year agreement with Apple and the success of the Snapdragon X60 5G in the iPhone 12, it seems like Apple will be sticking with QCOM modems for the near future. I say the near future because Apple’s acquisition of Intel’s modem division indicates they will begin to develop their own chipset at some point.

There is not much in the space of real threatening competition for QCOM right now. The Chinese phone manufacturer, Huawei, designs its own 5G chips and outsources production through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , but previously offered QCOM chips in its flagship models. This stopped once the trade sanctions were put in place August 2020 (which surprisingly did not result in a hit to the stock even though Huawei is the worlds biggest supplier of 5G phones).  Huawei's only 5G chip, the Kirin 980, is [blown out of the water](https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-875-vs-hisilicon-kirin-980) by QCOMs most recent 5G chip. As of now QCOM only has a [license to sell 4G chips to the Huawei, which is severly limiting their ability to supply smartphones and driving up the prices](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones). When Biden inevitably [lifts the trade restrictions he contested](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1214060.shtml), Huawei will become another massive customer of QCOM and may even follow Apple's lead by abandoning their own chip design for QCOMs superior modems as the defualt modem in their flagship models. The revenue from this should be extensive due to pent up demand.

Samsung has historically produced its own modems but QCOM's Snapdragon 888 seems to work [better in Samsung’s phone than their own newest Exynos 2100](https://www.gsmarena.com/exynos_2100_vs_snapdragon_888_sustained_performance_and_throttling_on_the_samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_v-news-47769.php) and you can currently buy the phone with [either chip](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/samsung-fans-have-had-it-with-exynos-processors). There is increasing pressure for Samsung to follow suit with apple and almost all other android smartphones and transition entirely to QCOM modems.

QCOM has a ridiculous [patent portfolio](https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/qroniclesofinvention/index.html) and tons of high performing low cost 5G chips available.

This is likely why it continues to dominate its much smaller competitors such as Skyworks and Broadcom. However, one of the more impressive aspects of the portfolio is the large investment in AI. Almost all modern processors take advantage of AI in some way and this will really set the stage for the future of the industry.

If technology innovation follows its historical pattern, 6G will likely not be commercially available until around 2030 and considering the exponentially increasing patent portfolio due to reinvestment in R&amp;D by QCOM, it could be a leader in this as well.

&amp;#x200B;

[Fundamental Analysis of QCOM and Competition \(Purple Estimates are from Yahoo Financial Analysts\)](https://preview.redd.it/7v1s0jbjrcj61.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9555472846e6d11e14ced4186b25b91caa0caba)

QCOM is currently trading at around $137.12 after the recent volatility and I think it is a great opportunity to look at ITM Call options. It is the most affordable of its competition apart from intel which failed to keep Apple and was forced to [exit the modem industry](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/227720-how-intel-lost-10-billion-and-the-mobile-market). It also has by far the best opportunity for growth. I think the Yahoo analyst projection is actually conservative.

There is another manufacturer that some people are claiming is relevant, MediaTek. I completely disagree. While it does have 5G chips, they are abysmal compared to everything else. They have very little scalability because they are a penny stock on TPE.

**Price Prediction**

Looking at the price action excluding the spike from the announcement of the Apple agreement in April 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

[Price action analysis of QCOM ](https://preview.redd.it/rajh6u56ocj61.png?width=1687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73e89cab7db1b5d0ed86106641d41b2b4d8a3236)

It seems likely the price could range from $167.54 in the most bearish case to $258.99 in the most bullish. Giving a heavier weight to the bullish trajectory I believe $225 is a reasonable target at the current rate.

The previous Fibonacci retracement is not comparable due to the onset Covid-19 restrctions and the previous action is not very informative either because there are way too many developments in both the company and market. However, if we assume a retracement back to 0.618 at a price of $125.27 (I think the market will start to turn around due to Powell's testimony).  We should see a bounce late this week or early next week. Since this was a recovery I am expecting a trend reversal around the first Fibonacci extension metric. Which should happen close to year end, in a bullish case it keeps going on to the second metric.

However, since the federal reserve is going to continue to its MMT policies along with the exponential rise in trading, I think 5G companies haven't yet received the attention they could (apart from AVGO), with the S&amp;P sitting at around a 39 average PE, I believe QCOMs PE has a lot of potential for upward movement in this bull market.

If we model QCOMS EPS with a 5th degree polynomial (excluding outliers) to allow for the exponential growth of 5G while hampering growth rate due to slower growth of other aspects of the company, this is the result.

&amp;#x200B;

[Red lines indicate Q1 and Q4 model EPS predictions, the equation of the best fit  polynomial is displayed. The 0.8&amp;#37; Confidence interval is shown as it visually fits the previous data well. ](https://preview.redd.it/8cntgna8ocj61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb9daa431f121e9876350d9c55e2be1be8c0d3e)

This puts the target price after 2021 at $342.45 ***at its current PE***, obviously the uncertainty is massive though and that is mostly due to the recent price action.

Right now Jan 21, 2022 Calls with a $135 strike are $19.50 bid and $20.55 ask. The theta is currently -0.028 and a delta of 0.588 because it is pretty much ATM with a 36.63 IV. The IV has taken a 17% hit due to what looks like a recent correction, however this was mostly due to speculation about monetary policy, and I expect the IV to bounce as demand increases.

[Date Key for Graphs](https://preview.redd.it/y3ugz6f89dj61.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f235f0d720e59f9fb2343771bf8d941cb918e1)

The vega is at its peak at 0.508 and only slowly declines as the options go ITM while IV sharply rises, I expect a significant premium increase due to this in the rebound.

The gamma is pretty low due to the length of the option and only decreases.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gamma](https://preview.redd.it/7dns6nc0adj61.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eec82bccfcce256cc9f2f36166afbd907e0bcbe)

However, despite this, if we saw a return to last week's price delta would increase to nearly 0.9.

&amp;#x200B;

[Delta](https://preview.redd.it/jdtgd4x9adj61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04554cc43fde2d69a648da5e6e0cbd7b85b4e6f0)

Thetas look relatively stable until you get 2-3 weeks from expiry and deep OTM.  If you shoot for a pre-holiday sell or roll, and you stay at least above 25% OTM, you are looking at about a 40-60% theta hit to the premium. However, following a vega path in this box, you will see a range from 0.2-0.4 average vega, with IV following correspondingly to the intrinsic value, it could see an average of about 45-65. Thus its possible to offset the theta loss with 2.6 (13%) to 11.2 (56%) \[using $20 premium\] which would average to about a 15.5% premium loss. I think this could even be less however because the rebound will likely be soon.

&amp;#x200B;

[Vega Path](https://preview.redd.it/b2dfpdackdj61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a6e8109e0910863f5efd91fd0a4e81ed28a27a)

It is pretty clear that the average delta will be around 0.9 assuming it goes in the right direction.

Assuming the greeks follow the ranges above and selling or rolling at the target, in the most bearish case where it enters and follows the pre-Covid price action we can expect a $167 price which would net around a 229% return for the year. If we move to the next most bearish case (Yahoo Analysts) , this would net a 260% return. I think a 350-600% return is most likely though. It is not unreasonable to humor the possibility of a 1000% return on this investment in just one year.  If this stock begins to get more (deserved) attention and the PE starts to rise due to its real future value, this could be a really amazing trade 1000%+. These numbers seem too good to be true, but I invested heavily and have mostly held and or rolled both Apple and TSLA since 2017 based on similar principles, which adds to my confidence in this investment.

I’ve been digging into this uranium market and I’m seeing some awesome things. Do your own DD and make your own choices - I DO NOT GIVE FINANCIAL ADVICE. 

First, there is a lot of positive news for nuclear power. This week has seen a massive pump because of the power crisis in Texas. Despite Texas’s negligence in that case it has brought nuclear to the forefront of world attention which is a great thing. There was already a LOT of positive movement before this week though, with many uranium stocks seeing +100% from Dec - Feb. Biden has shown pro-nuclear sentiments for his clean energy plans, big deals have been happening with companies like DNN, and Japan is finally getting back into the nuclear power field again after the Fukushima accident (which crashed the last uranium bull market). Japan getting back in alone will increase demand and in turn increase prices which elevate stock value. Lots of great news here. I believe Elon is very pro-nuclear as well and will be interested to see if he comments on it. 

The last uranium bull market started around year 2000 and the biggest gains were seen up through 2007. Companies like Paladin (PALAF) saw gains of over 100,000%. Back then there were hundreds of uranium companies, now there are only around 50 - 60 and some of those are dormant. 

Some strong tickers to look into are UUUU ($5.94), PENMF ($0.14), DNN ($1.40), NXE ($3.77), DYLLF ($0.65),  &amp; CCJ ($17). There are plenty more floating around but from my personal searching these seem the strongest to me. CCJ is essentially the largest miner and is around $17 - which is the MOST EXPENSIVE stock in this list. 🤯. That means some of these are OTC stocks though so sorry Robinhood users - get a real broker. 

The leadership from Paladin (the company that saw 100x in the early 2000’s) has moved to DYLLF (aka Deep Yellow) which is currently trading for only $0.65. Their CEO is a legend in the field so this is pretty promising. 

For a safer play, there is an ETF avail for around $60 - URNM.

Some strong tickers to look into are UUUU ($5.94), PENMF ($0.14), DNN ($1.40), NXE ($3.77), DYLLF ($0.65),  &amp; CCJ ($17). There are plenty more floating around but from my personal searching these seem the strongest to me. CCJ is essentially the largest miner and is around $17 - which is the MOST EXPENSIVE stock in this list. 🤯. That means some of these are OTC stocks though so sorry Robinhood users - get a real broker. 

The leadership from Paladin (the company that saw 100x in the early 2000’s) has moved to DYLLF (aka Deep Yellow) which is currently trading for only $0.65. Their CEO is a legend in the field so this is pretty promising. 

For a safer play, there is an ETF avail for around $60 - URNM. 

Most of you have probably seen DNN success this week but keep in mind they were taking off before the massive spike this week and they have positive news to support their success. Some of it will sell off but it has plenty of room for growth.",uranium market pump dump see great gain short long term tl uranium undervalue last uranium bull market saw massive gain plenty positive news international support invest market short long term dig uranium market see awesome thing dd make choice give financial advice first lot positive news nuclear power week see massive pump power crisis texas despite texas negligence case brought nuclear forefront world attention great thing already lot positive movement week though many uranium see dec feb biden show pro sentiment clean energy plan big deal happen company like dnn japan finally get back nuclear power field fukushima accident crashed last uranium bull market japan get back alone increase demand turn increase price elevate value lot great news believe elon pro well interested see comment last uranium bull market start around year 2000 big gain see 2007 company like paladin saw gain 100 back hundred uranium company around 50 60 dormant strong ticker look uuuu penmf dnn nxe dyllf ccj plenty float around personal search seem strong ccj essentially large miner around expensive list mean otc though sorry robinhood user get real broker leadership paladin company saw 100x early 2000 move dyllf deep yellow currently trading ceo legend field pretty promising safer play etf avail around urnm probably see dnn success week keep mind take massive spike week positive news support success sell plenty room growth,231

Ultimately, they want to make GrowGeneration the largest hydroponics chain in the country.

While Lampert and Salaman remain at the head of the company, GrowGeneration has added new talent to its team. Tony Sullivan joined the company as COO at the end of 2019, bringing with him 30 years of big-box store experience.

**San Diego Hydroponics Acquisition**

This morning, GrowGeneration [Acquired San Diego's Leading Hydroponics Supplier, Expands Footprint in Southern California](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/growgeneration-acquires-san-diegos-leading-130000858.html). 

Acquisition Brings Number of GrowGen Locations Nationwide to 50

&gt;""Southern California is a priority market for GrowGeneration, and we are excited to add San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics to our ever-expanding footprint there,"" said Darren Lampert, GrowGen's CEO. ""As the leading hydroponics supplier, San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics strategically positions GrowGen to conveniently provide our services to commercial growers in the Southern California market.""

Founded in 2001 by Todd Kent, San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics first opened its doors with an 800-square-foot store in Pacific Beach, California. Since then, San Diego Hydroponics &amp;amp; Organics has expanded to four locations with more than 20,000-square-feet of retail space and 20 employees, who will join GrowGeneration's team of over 500 grow professionals as part of the transaction.

**GrowBiz and Grassroots Hydroponics Acquisitions**

GrowGeneration also recently acquired [GrowBiz](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growgeneration-completes-acquisition-of-the-growbiz-301175338.html) and [Grassroots Hydroponics](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growgeneration-acquires-california-based-grassroots-hydroponics-expands-footprint-in-southern-california-301192595.html). GrowBiz was the third largest hydroponic gardening chain in the country, which brings a significant competitor into the GrowGeneration fold, according to Lampert. This acquisition is helping the company to expand its presence in northern California, and it brings with it significant talent and $50 million in profitable revenue, and it added industry veteran Ross Haley, the founder of GrowBiz, as an advisor.

&gt;In 2020, most of the company’s commercial revenue was generated by East Coast operations. The GrowBiz acquisition, as well as the Grassroots Hydroponics deal, is a part of the company’s push to create a larger West Coast presence. Grassroots Hydroponics is a three-store chain outside of Los Angeles that will also serve as a part of that West Coast strategy. It has been in business for more than a decade and does $20 million in business, according to Lampe.

DIX whitepaper:
https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short_is_long.pdf?

GEX whitepaper:
https://squeezemetrics.com/download/white_paper.pdf

Both indicators are very useful. The all-time low GEX print Thursday night hinted at a very volatile day today. A follow on Twitter is necessary to make the most use out of it. 

Example: The /ES reversal at 11:30 hinted that the lows were in, because the Squeezemetrics account posted this chart: 
https://twitter.com/squeezemetrics/status/1367652313230376965?s=21 
showing much less “slipperyness” below 3740. 

The whitepapers are important to read. It won’t make any sense without understanding the logic behind them. Unless you’re experienced and educated in finance, it might take you some time. That’s okay. Take your time and reread what you need to, Google what you don’t understand (like the concept of dark pools/ institutional off-exchange market making). 

It’s very useful, because it aggregates purchases and sales on the S&amp;P (…sort of) that we otherwise wouldn’t know about. 

#Lily’s NOPE
Lily is a very smart grad student who developed this site:

https://nopechart.com/

Here is the whitepaper:

https://www.scribd.com/document/487296659/Investigating-Delta-Gamma-Hedging-Impact-on-SPY-Returns-2007-2020

Here is her Twitter:

https://twitter.com/nope_its_lily?s=21

She is also worth a follow, for the discussion of the efficacy of her model with other smart folks. When it works, when it doesn’t, and why. She asks for help when she needs it and is honest. 

Example: Today, NOPE’s reading on SPY strongly reversed trend at ~11:30. This supported the theory that the intraday trend has changed. 

It also tracks meme stocks, which is actually its “intended” purpose - to illustrate options market effects on the underlying’s price action/trend. 

#Corey Hoffstein’s Paper on Options, Liquidity, and Consequences

Corey is the CIO of Newfound Research. 

https://twitter.com/choffstein?s=21

They have a lot of papers available, but the one pinned is extremely insightful. *If there is any paper here that you choose to read, it’s this one*:

https://docsend.com/view/cx86pd8yyyea4isw

It seems complicated at first, but give it a shot. I sure as hell didn’t understand it all. He discusses the Fed/Central Bank management of liquidity, risks and effects a roaring and speculative options market, the reflexive impacts of options speculation on the price of the underlying, and the pricing and liquidity issues that compound when volatility meets ETF basket-trades. In different words, there are many new and growing cascading, cross-asset and positively-correlated effects that should be taken into account if you are trading today. 

(It’s less complicated than it sounds, just look at ARK funds and Powell’s choice of words this week!)

#_Addendum (notable Twitter follows):_
#Stretching Spreads: 
https://twitter.com/fadingrallies?s=21

Market structure analysis, liquidity, volatility, etc. Valuable because he shows ample evidence to support his statement from Bloomberg Terminal screencaps. Good updates on cross asset class risk. 

#TradingVolatility:
https://twitter.com/tradevolatility?s=21

Reported intraday gamma flip point is useful, and the UVXY weighting updates (VX1, VX2) is nice if you are a degenerate like me that trades it. I don’t pay for the service. 

#Breaking Market News:
https://twitter.com/financialjuice?s=21

I don’t pay for the service. The 3:30 and ~3:45 updates on MOC imbalance is useful to know what to expect during the last 1, 5, 15 minutes of trading. 

____
I have a few more that “complete the circle”, but following this group does give good insight into broad market option positioning, meme stocks, and all kinds of things. Left out those that seem to have a bullish or bearish bias. You can find your favorites pretty quickly from the above list.

Lily shitposts often on the weekends, but she isn’t egotistical at all (rare for FinTwit accounts). NOPE is an extremely useful tool nowadays.

The whitepapers are important to read. It won’t make any sense without understanding the logic behind them. Unless you’re experienced and educated in finance, it might take you some time. That’s okay. Take your time and reread what you need to, Google what you don’t understand (like the concept of dark pools/ institutional off-exchange market making). 

It’s very useful, because it aggregates purchases and sales on the S&amp;P (…sort of) that we otherwise wouldn’t know about. 

#Lily’s NOPE
Lily is a very smart grad student who developed this site:

https://nopechart.com/

Here is the whitepaper:

https://www.scribd.com/document/487296659/Investigating-Delta-Gamma-Hedging-Impact-on-SPY-Returns-2007-2020

Here is her Twitter:

https://twitter.com/nope_its_lily?s=21

She is also worth a follow, for the discussion of the efficacy of her model with other smart folks. When it works, when it doesn’t, and why. She asks for help when she needs it and is honest. 

Example: Today, NOPE’s reading on SPY strongly reversed trend at ~11:30. This supported the theory that the intraday trend has changed. 

It also tracks meme stocks, which is actually its “intended” purpose - to illustrate options market effects on the underlying’s price action/trend. 

#Corey Hoffstein’s Paper on Options, Liquidity, and Consequences

Corey is the CIO of Newfound Research. 

https://twitter.com/choffstein?s=21

They have a lot of papers available, but the one pinned is extremely insightful. *If there is any paper here that you choose to read, it’s this one*:

https://docsend.com/view/cx86pd8yyyea4isw

It seems complicated at first, but give it a shot. I sure as hell didn’t understand it all. He discusses the Fed/Central Bank management of liquidity, risks and effects a roaring and speculative options market, the reflexive impacts of options speculation on the price of the underlying, and the pricing and liquidity issues that compound when volatility meets ETF basket-trades. In different words, there are many new and growing cascading, cross-asset and positively-correlated effects that should be taken into account if you are trading today. 

(It’s less complicated than it sounds, just look at ARK funds and Powell’s choice of words this week!)

#_Addendum (notable Twitter follows):_
#Stretching Spreads: 
https://twitter.com/fadingrallies?s=21

Market structure analysis, liquidity, volatility, etc. Valuable because he shows ample evidence to support his statement from Bloomberg Terminal screencaps. Good updates on cross asset class risk. 

#TradingVolatility:
https://twitter.com/tradevolatility?s=21

Reported intraday gamma flip point is useful, and the UVXY weighting updates (VX1, VX2) is nice if you are a degenerate like me that trades it. I don’t pay for the service. 

#Breaking Market News:
https://twitter.com/financialjuice?s=21

I don’t pay for the service. The 3:30 and ~3:45 updates on MOC imbalance is useful to know what to expect during the last 1, 5, 15 minutes of trading. 

____
I have a few more that “complete the circle”, but following this group does give good insight into broad market option positioning, meme stocks, and all kinds of things. Left out those that seem to have a bullish or bearish bias. You can find your favorites pretty quickly from the above list.

Lily shitposts often on the weekends, but she isn’t egotistical at all (rare for FinTwit accounts). NOPE is an extremely useful tool nowadays.

RADA specializes in military defense radar technologies and is growing and profitable as of 2020, with Uncle Sam 
(DoD) already working with them plus their radar/sensor technologies potentially used in autonomous driving/piloting, the company should have a bright future. In another note, ARK IZRL has been increasing their position for the past 3 weeks, the current market cap is only 600M, it won’t be long before Cathie’s fans double or triple that number.

RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. is a world leading defense technology company dedicated to proprietary radar solutions and avionics systems.
The company is a global pioneer of mini-tactical radars for active military protection, counter-drone applications, critical infrastructure protection and border surveillance.

RADA’s Products

RADA’s cutting-edge software defined, 4D AESA pulse Doppler radars enable lifesaving, mission-critical capabilities for the maneuver force.
With simultaneous multi-mission capability, our radar systems provide real-time 360° Situation Awareness for operational superiority.

APS, VPS &amp; HFD  

RADA advanced compact, lightweight radar sits at the heart of combat proven Active Protection Systems (APS), Vehicle Protection Systems (VPS) and Hostile Fire Detection (HFD) applications, multi-mission AESA 4D pulse Doppler systems rapidly detect, track and classify all relevant threats – small arms, RPGs, ATGMs and tank rounds.

SHORAD &amp; C-UAS

RADA’s family of advanced radars are the system-of-choice for Mobile Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) systems.
Providing enhanced fire control and air surveillance capabilities, the mature radar systems detect and track all types of aerial threats including Nano drones and short-range indirect fire.

C-RAM

RADA’s proven radars are deployed by leading armed forces for Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) Sense &amp; Warn missions. The systems detect, track and classify all types of elevated fire.

Hemispheric Surveillance

RADA’s vehicle-mounted or static radar platforms provide superior hemispheric surveillance, and simultaneous detection and tracking of aerial and ground threats.
Offering comprehensive perimeter and border surveillance, the advanced systems detect, track and classify intruders: small and slow aircraft, drones, vehicles, vessels, pedestrians, and more.

Avionics Systems (DVDR)

RADA is a leading provider of advanced airborne Digital Video and Data Recorders (DVDR) proven in the most demanding combat environments.
The company’s wide range of fully-mature solid-state digital recorders, cameras, and debriefing systems are recognized as the best value solutions for aerial deployment.

Current Clients

Supplying a global customer base that includes the armed forces of more than 30 countries, our advanced radars are deployed on hundreds of battle-platforms of the IDF, IAF, US Army, USMC, USAF, US SOF and more.

Consumer Market Potentials 

RADA’s US subsidiaries including:

RADA Technologies LLC
RADA Innovations LLC
RADA Sensors Inc

So far, I can’t find any products that will be used by the mass consumer market, but with the rise of autonomous driving and autonomous piloting, the reality of robotics will eventually be able to identify  and communicate with each other (especially while moving).
The potential application of RADA’s technologies could be enormous, I think that’s why ARK keeps buying this stock for the past 3 weeks.

Financials

Highlights of Full Year 2020 (https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/rada-announces-record-q4-full-102800152.html)
* Record revenues of $76.2 million, up 72% year-over-year;

* EBITDA of $9.7 million, compared to $0.4 million in 2019;
* Year-end net cash position of $35.8 million.

Institutional Backing

RADA’s top holders are not the biggest names, however, with Renaissance Technologies LLC and ARK IZRL[ Link ](https://ark-funds.com/israel-etf)  leading the way and keep buying, it’s safe to say the company and its technologies are solid.

Just finished typing up the notes for potential plays we covered earlier. Some changes from my last watchlist post... I decided to leave out the video link and just attach chart images so you don't have to scroll through the video to find the specific ticker.

I still included the notes below for those that just want to read what we covered and don't want to view the images. If you want to see the chart images *with* the text, then you can find the Google document [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing).

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**\*\* $AAPL:** continuing to monitor this as we have March 12 exp, $119 Puts in play. Was worried throughout last Friday, but the selloff before market close is right in line with the resistance level. As long as it stays below $124-125, the downtrend is still in play. Need to be careful of $120 area as that seems like a good support level from the past 3-4 days.

Price Targets: $119 target (same as last week)

&amp;#x200B;

**$GRPN:** huge move on earnings beat, pulled back a bit and holding above $13.27 (61.8% fib level support). If this holds, look for continuation back to ATH at $44-45.

Price Targets: $45 &gt; $48 &gt; $51 &gt; $60 (best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**$STMP:** huge selloff after earnings and back at key support level from previous price action. Look for strength/momentum to go long. It could fall more to the other key support levels at $165.67 &gt; $159 (daily 50% fib level). I’m a little bearish on this as it’s currently below the 200 EMA and the RSI/MACD/Slow Stoch looks rough. However, if we can catch those support levels on the bounce back up that’ll be amazing.  
Price Targets (from $159 support): $165 &gt; $177 &gt; $188 &gt; $207 &gt; $231 &gt; $285

&amp;#x200B;

**$RKT:** Huge swing up above resistance, but sold off the gains it made. However, it’s holding above $21.53 (the 23.6% fib level) as support on the daily. Stochastics and RSI are curling up and the MACD is consolidating (on the daily chart). Shoot for next fib level at $24, but be careful as that’s a resistance it rejected multiple times in the past.

Price Target: $24

&amp;#x200B;

**\* $STPK:** Super bullish on this, above 200 EMA, above the uptrend support, bounced off fib support (50%), diverging volume, RSI heading towards uptrend conditions, MACD curling up, slow stochastics heading up from oversold ---&gt; All on 4 hour chart. Daily still looks bullish as well--above 50 EMA, uptrend support, and RSI curling back toward uptrend.

Price Targets: $35 &gt; $38 &gt; $40 &gt; $51 (best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**$BBY:** huge selloff after earnings (a huge one at that because it legged down one whole uptrend channel), could be a good over-exaggeration/long term swing play, however it needs to hold the $98.66 level for me to be confident to go long. I wouldn’t hold my breath though because the RSI, MACD, and Stoch look rough.

Price Targets: $100 &gt; $103 &gt; $106 &gt; $110 (best case scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

**$CZR:** huge spike after earnings and holding above 61.8% fib level support, could test ATH again ($94.43) if it holds. Used fib extension to give price targets should the ATH level hold.

Price Targets: $94.50 &gt; $95 &gt; $98 (100% fib ext level)----&gt; going long  
$91.55 &gt; $90 &gt; $88 ---&gt; going short

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\* $SNOW:** Earnings coming up Wed after hours. I’ve made good money on SNOW before and haven’t traded it since then so I decided to revisit it. The 4hr chart looks great with the bounce off $254.54 (78.6% fib level), RSI, MACD, and stochastics look great as well. Looking for a fill back up to $275 which is the next key resistance on the daily chart that also lines up with the 200 EMA. We also looked at the call volume and there’s over 2,000 Open Interest (OI) and Volume on the $300 and $350 strikes. Was looking to hold fairly cheap lotto calls through earnings which is this coming Wednesday AH. Don’t think it’ll make the same movement as it did after the previous earnings (almost $100), but if it proves me wrong that’ll be amazing.

Price Targets: $267 &gt; $275 &gt; $291 &gt; $300 &gt; $319 &gt; 376 (if it makes another $100 move)

Most of you who are reading this have probably never heard of the American drone company AgEagle Aerial Systems (ticker $UAVS) and a few of you probably have. I have been following the company for over a year and will give you the scoop of what’s going on:

Background on the company: UAVS specializes in agricultural mapping and has recently shifted to the drone package delivery sector (see recent partnership with Valqari , a company which specializes in drone delivery solutions): [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109196/0/en/AgEagle-Aerial-Systems-Partners-with-Valqari-to-Manufacture-Drone-Delivery-Stations.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109196/0/en/AgEagle-Aerial-Systems-Partners-with-Valqari-to-Manufacture-Drone-Delivery-Stations.html)

This partnership with Valqiri along with a partnership with “major e-commerce” platform that they cannot disclose due to an NDA has led to UAVS running up from $2 to an ATH of $17.68 in the span of 6 months.

**Now for the REALLY juicy part.** Today a ragtag short activist by the name of Bonita Research released a hit piece on the company with some blatantly false information which caused uninformed investors to panic sell **causing $UAVS fall of 40% in an hour**. Here is a link to the hit piece which I will debunk below : [https://www.bonitasresearch.com/](https://www.bonitasresearch.com/)

**background on:** Bonitas Research is a 'short activist' who frequently posts bogus short attack pieces and invokes the first amendment whenever they are sued by the companies they attack for their absurd claims.

**Debunking their report:**

For starters they begin the report by listing UAVS on the COMPLETELY WRONG EXCHANGE (NASDAQ instead of NYSE). They then go on to accuse the company of being a pump and dump with the catalyst being an unofficial YouTube video that supposedly HINTED at a partnership between UAVS and Amazon. THIS OCCURED 10 MONTHS AGO. Yes you read that correctly. They then go on to say “we have found no evidence of any major e-commerce customer or drone technology credited to AgEagle”. **However you can explicitly find evidence of the major ecommerce partnership in the SEC filings of AgEagle:**

\*\*""\*\*In the third quarter of 2019, AgEagle announced that it had begun to actively pursue expansion opportunities within the emerging Drone Logistics and Transportation market and revealed that it had received its first purchase orders from a major ecommerce company to manufacture and assemble UAVs designed to meet the critical specifications for drones that are meant to carry packaged goods in urban and suburban areas""

This major ecommerce partnership extends well into 2021 for reference and they have seen immense growth since the partnership.

The Bonitas hit piece reads like it was written by a fifth grader who just discovered WSB but it has caused uninformed investors to panic sell. As soon as these claims are addressed by AgEagle (most likely today) and when others who are privy to the company call out the 'report' (if you can even call it that) for its BS, those who panic sold will get right back in. It is already climbing back up after AH (+**3.57%** at the time of this post) and I don't see it going back down to the extent that it has in the future. I don't post here often but I view this as a literal once in a lifetime opportunity given the nature of the situation. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

partialcredditor,0.0,26.0,"There is a ton of good advice on this sub and others on how to use the wheel strategy but I believe the majority of the guides are missing an important point.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine the case when we allocate a part of our portfolio to start turning the wheel. Almost unanimously the suggestion is to find good wheel stocks/funds (more on that later) and purchase cash secured puts (CSPs). These are either a week or a month out depending on the author. And strategies on when these positions are closed vary.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the part that needs to change. If this is the optimal strategy to start the wheel with cash, this should be the only strategy needed. It's not like you are stuck with an illiquid holding.

&amp;#x200B;

The general advice is if you get assigned the stock because the stock closed below your strike, you should sell covered calls. Some go as far as to suggest that these covered calls be sold above the assignment price so that you don't ""lose"" money. What? I would argue that you already lost that amount. By picking a sub-optimal strategy to get yourself out of the hole is plainly wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Another advice is to try to roll the CSP before assignment but only if you are going to get a credit. Again, what? Why are you now worried about trying to get a credit and choosing to do something suboptimal again.

&amp;#x200B;

The wheel portion of the portfolio is liquid. If you get assigned you can just sell that stock and ignore how much you lost and go your merry way with the strategy designed to give you the best bet. Better yet, roll your losing CSP to the next period and pay the debit if you have to.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other points I like doing in this strategy are:

\- Instead of holding index funds you should be wheeling them: SPY, EEM and many other funds have an active options market.

\- Best wheel stocks are those you want to hold for a while, typically have high volatility or you feel it is safe to buy and sell at a price point. I like PLTR as it always has some action, NOK is also near a safe point and sometimes has volatility. I am also wheeling F, C, WFC, AAL, UAL, DAL, MAC, SPG. Although some are rather stable for turning a lot of profit, I want to hold these for a long-term.

\- This is a point I didn't get to test yet but if a stock is at a very low level of IV, your best bet is to just buy the stock until there is some movement in some direction again. You don't want to miss out long-term holding profits just because the IV is not there.

Disclaimer: not financial advice, just someone trying to figure out options trading.

**Update:** 

Thanks for all the comments. There seems to be room for both approaches. One private comment I got mentioned the difference between a technical move or a fundamental move in the underlying. Of course this is hard to figure out at the time but if the belief is that the stock moved down because of some normal market cycle you would benefit from taking assignment and selling calls at the original point of entry. If it is a fundamental move down however, this approach makes you lose on harvesting premiums.

Thanks for all the comments. There seems to be room for both approaches. One private comment I got mentioned the difference between a technical move or a fundamental move in the underlying. Of course this is hard to figure out at the time but if the belief is that the stock moved down because of some normal market cycle you would benefit from taking assignment and selling calls at the original point of entry. If it is a fundamental move down however, this approach makes you lose on harvesting premiums.

**The (Forgotten) Deal**

In December 2018, Cronos Group Inc. [Announced C$2.4 Billion Strategic Investment](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cronos-group-inc-announces-c2-4-billion-strategic-investment-from-altria-group-inc-300761820.html) from Altria Group, Inc.

Altria Group bought a 45 percent stake in leading cannabinoid company Cronos Group for about $1.8 billion.

Altria **also** has a warrant that would allow it to increase its stake in Cronos to about 55 percent at a price of $19 per share. It allows Cronos the flexibility to take investments from other companies such as, for example, a big food company. 

&gt;""The proceeds from Altria's investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumer,"" Cronos CEO Mike Gorenstein said.

Its established U.S. presence should, therefore, serve to benefit Cronos, when cannabis is legalized federally. I suspect majority ownership will come into effect within the next 6-8 months. 

&gt;""most important aspect of growth is going to be innovation and R&amp;D; The proceeds from Altria's investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumers. Importantly, Altria shares our vision of driving long-term value through innovation **(technology)**, and we look forward to continuing to differentiate in this area. As one of the largest holding companies in the adult consumer products sector, Altria has decades of experience in regulatory, government affairs, compliance, product development and brand management that we expect to leverage, particularly as new markets for cannabis open around the world.""

This strategic partnership provides Cronos Group with additional financial resources, product development and commercialization capabilities, and deep regulatory expertise to better position the Company to compete, scale and lead the rapidly growing global cannabis industry.

BIGJAYsmalljay,0.0,26.0,"Every time I see another pump article on the “next Chinese Tesla” because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, “NIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!” comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it’s cold AF outside.

So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don’t like these stocks.

**1. Positions**

&amp;#x200B;

[I know my lazy ass needs to switch](https://preview.redd.it/kurgz1t5dyg61.jpg?width=642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90eecfa0da240c7fc196b911ecc3756b9107f57e)

&amp;#x200B;

A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly today. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.

**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**

Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.

Current PS as of 2/10/2021

\- TSLA: \~25

\- NIO: \~40

\- XPENG: \~41

\- LI: \~19 (It’s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)

Let’s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let’s look at high margin tech anyways.

* NFLX: \~10
* ABNB: \~28
* PLTR: \~72 (peter pan stock)

Actual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma’s teets

\- TM: \~0.8

\- F: \~0.4

\- VWAGY: \~0.5

I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don’t ask me how I did that, the answer either won’t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what’s important right now.

Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn’t change

\- TSLA: \~22

\- NIO: \~29

\- XPENG: \~26

\- LI: \~14

Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it’s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king’s girlfriend.

Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.

Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.

**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**

You might be one of those Stocktwats and you’re thinking; “but but... they’ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!” \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won’t and here is why.

Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They’re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn’t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.

Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you’re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug’s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.

TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you’re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?

NIO: 100% SUVs

Xpeng: 40% SUVs

Brand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking “Well, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.” Fine, let’s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.

Let’s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVsTesla Model Y- Price: \~$52,800

\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s

\- Charger network: 20,000+

NIO EC6

\- Price: \~$57,200

\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \~$9k for a bigger battery)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s

\- Charger network: 290+

Xpeng G3 520

\- Price: \~$30,580

\- Range: 520 km

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s

\- Charger network: 866+

You may be thinking the G3 520’s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you’ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.

“But JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It’s perfect for China’s dense cities!” If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That’s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I’d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can’t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I’m Chinese and know some first hand) don’t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.

Back to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still reading Robinhood as a picture book.

Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla’s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.

“But JJ… China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!” Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.

Solar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn’t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.Oh and let’s not forget about autonomy… no, let’s forget about it (for now).

International expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a [""made in china""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILKm-DC06A) EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.

Back to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it’ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.

**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**

History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was [“made in china”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILKm-DC06A) at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).

Let’s look at the current state of margins.

Q3 2020 Gross Margins

\- Tesla: 23.5%

\- Nio: 12.9%

\- Xpeng: 4.6%

\- Li Auto: 19.8%

We’ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it’s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla’s solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \[redacted\] at $400.

“But JJ, that’s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!” First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier “ramp” years.

2017: 18.9%

2016: 22.8%

2015: 22.8%

This may not look right, something must be wrong you’re thinking. Well, let’s we take a look under the hood, you won’t find Trayvon Martin.

\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the “skateboard” design, saying it’s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!

\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.

&amp;#x200B;

[Can you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?](https://preview.redd.it/72et2w9ddyg61.jpg?width=1372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe000d0ffd056053b2a22d0290f22958e8c1422c)

\- Tesla’s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.

\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron’s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.

\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.

\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources

\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network

\- Connectivity: Startlink? \*shrugs\*

\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn’t trust Nio and Xpeng’s software with your wife’s boyfriend’s life

**5. Closing**

Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let’s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?

CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.

I’m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it’s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I’ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.

At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I’ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.

TL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto",1,"Puts on Chinese EVs $NIO, $XPEV, Wish Me Luckin",26.0,0.79,"Puts on Chinese EVs $NIO, $XPEV, Wish Me Luckin Every time I see another pump article on the “next Chinese Tesla” because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, “NIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!” comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it’s cold AF outside.

So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don’t like these stocks.

**1. Positions**

&amp;#x200B;

[I know my lazy ass needs to switch](https://preview.redd.it/kurgz1t5dyg61.jpg?width=642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90eecfa0da240c7fc196b911ecc3756b9107f57e)

&amp;#x200B;

A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly today. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.

**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**

Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.

Current PS as of 2/10/2021

\- TSLA: \~25

\- NIO: \~40

\- XPENG: \~41

\- LI: \~19 (It’s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)

Let’s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let’s look at high margin tech anyways.

* NFLX: \~10
* ABNB: \~28
* PLTR: \~72 (peter pan stock)

Actual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma’s teets

\- TM: \~0.8

\- F: \~0.4

\- VWAGY: \~0.5

I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don’t ask me how I did that, the answer either won’t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what’s important right now.

Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn’t change

\- TSLA: \~22

\- NIO: \~29

\- XPENG: \~26

\- LI: \~14

Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it’s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king’s girlfriend.

Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.

Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.

**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**

You might be one of those Stocktwats and you’re thinking; “but but... they’ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!” \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won’t and here is why.

Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They’re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn’t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.

Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you’re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug’s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.

Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla’s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.

**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**

History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports.

2017: 18.9%

2016: 22.8%

This may not look right, something must be wrong you’re thinking. Well, let’s we take a look under the hood, you won’t find Trayvon Martin.

Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the “skateboard” design, saying it’s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it.

**5. Closing**

Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let’s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride.

CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.

I’m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it’s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I’ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.

At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I’ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.

Thought it would be helpful to explain how order priority works. Just because your order is in first, it doesn't mean you will be filled if an option trades at your price. Generally there is what's known as customer priority, but there are numerous exceptions.

There are 16 different options exchanges. If your order is sent to the CBOE for example and you change the market and are currently the best bid, that option can trade at your price on any of the other 15 exchanges and you won't necessarily be filled. It can also trade at the same exchange at your price and you might not be filled if the option was traded in a spread.

Exchanges have different rules as well and they also may change by product. For example the SPX, which is only traded at the CBOE. Here if you have priority as a customer in the SPX weeklies. You will be filled before any MM, etc. But in the SPX monthly AM expiration, you are filled based on +pro rata"" so you can be first, but your fill will depend on the size of your order vs the MM's size.

Orfeaus,0.0,24.0,"I'm relatively new to options. I've been reading tons of stuff from a variety of different sources, scouring subreddits like this one and watching any videos I can get my hands on. I've learned a lot (compared to where I was a just few weeks back) but there are still a few things about IV that are tripping me up and I'm hoping someone can help clarify.

Part of the problem here is that different people explain these concepts differently, so it's constantly generating confusion for me. Take this excerpt from a TD Ameritrade [page](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/options-implied-volatility-probability-15125):

&gt;The Current IV Percentile shows you today’s IV compared to the high and low range for the past 12 months. A 50th percentile means IV is exactly in between the high and low values. A percentile closer to 0% means vol is low, and closer to 100% means vol is high relative to where it’s been.

Contrast that with this description from [Tastyworks](http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/implied-volatility-rank-and-percentile):

&gt;Implied Volatility Percentile (IVP), a totally different calculation, provides traders with another metric by which they can analyze the price of an option. IVP tells us the percentage of days over the last year that implied volatility traded **below** the current level.

Tastyworks describes IVR in the way that the previous article seems to describe IVP:

&gt;IVR tells us whether implied volatility is high or low in a specific underlying based on the past year of [implied volatility](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility?__hstc=21858660.6601a30d5a5f08ae7d37b81c879a1452.1612804279326.1612804279326.1613120225187.2&amp;__hssc=21858660.2.1613120225187&amp;__hsfp=3587867223) (aka “IV”) data.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, if XYZ has had an IV between 30 and 60 over the past year and IV is currently trading at 45, XYZ would have an IV rank of 50%. Since all underlyings have unique IV ranges, stating an arbitrary IV number does not help us decide how we should proceed with a strategy - that's where IVR comes into play.

Another confounding thing is that there doesn't seem to be agreement across platforms on what these numbers are at a given moment in time. For example, ETrade shows IV% and IVR that are different from the numbers I see on [Barchart](https://www.barchart.com/options/iv-rank-percentile/stocks). These values can deviate wildly when comparing specific IV's for specific strike prices.

Which leads me to another question: how is the IV for an underlying (versus for its options) calculated and why is that even a thing? In other words, **why is IV assigned to an underlying instead of only assigning it to its strike prices?**

I saw someone say that the current IV of an underlying is just the average of its ATM strike prices, but this doesn't seem correct since when I looked at the IV strike prices they were much different than the IV assigned to the underlying itself.

The reason I'm asking this question is that I want to better understand when to buy and when to sell. On a simple level I understand selling is recommended when IV is high and buying when IV is low. However, which IV should be used to make this determination - the IV of a specific strike or the IV of the underlying overall? If it's the IV of the underlying overall then how do you deal with scenarios where the underlying's IV is on the low to mid side, but individual strike prices are well over 100%? 

Additionally, it's probably recommended to analyze a stock's Historical Volatility and Relative Volatility chart studies to help inform your decisions, or am I mistaken?",1,IV Ranks &amp; IV Percentiles &amp; Option IVs (Oh My),24.0,0.89,"IV Ranks &amp; IV Percentiles &amp; Option IVs (Oh My) I'm relatively new to options. I've been reading tons of stuff from a variety of different sources, scouring subreddits like this one and watching any videos I can get my hands on. I've learned a lot (compared to where I was a just few weeks back) but there are still a few things about IV that are tripping me up and I'm hoping someone can help clarify.

Part of the problem here is that different people explain these concepts differently, so it's constantly generating confusion for me. Take this excerpt from a TD Ameritrade [page](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/options-implied-volatility-probability-15125):

&gt;The Current IV Percentile shows you today’s IV compared to the high and low range for the past 12 months. A 50th percentile means IV is exactly in between the high and low values. A percentile closer to 0% means vol is low, and closer to 100% means vol is high relative to where it’s been.

Contrast that with this description from [Tastyworks](http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/implied-volatility-rank-and-percentile):

&gt;Implied Volatility Percentile (IVP), a totally different calculation, provides traders with another metric by which they can analyze the price of an option. IVP tells us the percentage of days over the last year that implied volatility traded **below** the current level.

Tastyworks describes IVR in the way that the previous article seems to describe IVP:

&gt;IVR tells us whether implied volatility is high or low in a specific underlying based on the past year of [implied volatility](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility?__hstc=21858660.6601a30d5a5f08ae7d37b81c879a1452.1612804279326.1612804279326.1613120225187.2&amp;__hssc=21858660.2.1613120225187&amp;__hsfp=3587867223) (aka “IV”) data.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, if XYZ has had an IV between 30 and 60 over the past year and IV is currently trading at 45, XYZ would have an IV rank of 50%. Since all underlyings have unique IV ranges, stating an arbitrary IV number does not help us decide how we should proceed with a strategy - that's where IVR comes into play.

Another confounding thing is that there doesn't seem to be agreement across platforms on what these numbers are at a given moment in time. For example, ETrade shows IV% and IVR that are different from the numbers I see on [Barchart](https://www.barchart.com/options/iv-rank-percentile/stocks). These values can deviate wildly when comparing specific IV's for specific strike prices.

Which leads me to another question: how is the IV for an underlying (versus for its options) calculated and why is that even a thing? In other words, **why is IV assigned to an underlying instead of only assigning it to its strike prices?**

I saw someone say that the current IV of an underlying is just the average of its ATM strike prices, but this doesn't seem correct since when I looked at the IV strike prices they were much different than the IV assigned to the underlying itself.

kultcher,0.0,24.0,"Been trying to learn options and I feel like I grasp them but the way folks talk about them on here makes it sound more complicated than what I am seeing. Decided to just go in with what feels like a low-risk, low-reward option but wanted to get feedback on if this was a good or bad or suboptimal, and how I might optimize going forward.

Sold a ~~covered~~ cash-secured put at $2 strike price on SNDL for 2/19 for a premium of $0.42. So my understanding is that as long as SNDL stays above $1.58 on 2/19, I keep the $42, right?

This feels reasonably safe to me, given that Sundial will get listed on NASDAQ if it holds this week and all that. Main risk seems to be some kind of bubble pop on the weed stocks.

2017

May, Jia resigned from LeEco’s parent company amid concerns over its liquidity and his personal finances. Earlier this month, it was reported that Jia said he had sold his stake in Lucid Motors for several hundred million dollars. Lucid would be delighted to see the back of Jia and any lingering association with the troubled Faraday Future. However, a source close to Lucid says that reports of Jia selling his shares are probably untrue.

2019 --NO GRANT

Meanwhile, development of the $60,000 Lucid Air has been proceeding well, and it was recently shown reaching 235 mph on a test track. However, Lucid has had its own setbacks, including abandoning attempts to design its own self-driving technology in favor of using a semi-autonomous system from Mobileye, now part of Intel.

&amp;#x200B;

Lucid plans to build an assembly plant in China, which would be financed entirely by local and regional government incentives. The site of its proposed U.S. factory, Casa Grande, Ariz., is being somewhat less generous. Lucid has a $1.5 million job-training grant from Arizona and is negotiating a further $5 million grant, according to a spokesperson for the state’s commerce authority. It could also apply for a tax credit program worth up to another $40 million.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the make-or-break loan for the $700 million facility would be a U.S. Department of Energy program to help build advanced-technology car plants. Tesla benefited from a $465 million DOE loan in 2010, while Ford secured one for $5.9 billion. But because the loan reimburses expenses rather than paying them up front, Lucid cannot move forward until it has financing in place.

&amp;#x200B;

Lucid began its fourth round of institutional fundraising earlier this year, with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley. Ford’s acquisition offer came as a surprise, said a source close to Lucid: “The bank approached Ford to see if they wanted to participate in the Series D. They came back and said they wanted to acquire.”

Draw your own conclusions but this is a quick rundown of what I see. Lucid started out ok as Atieva USA. They tried to move into building EVs. Finance was always the problem, no one would back them, or at least for long. Pulling up the compnays webpage, goes back to 2017. Mostly unchanged over the years. Same vague statements, promises, etc. Lucid only stays afloat by, for lack of a better word, tricking someone into financing them, or, money is government. Looks like they they got AZ caught in the trap. The only play they have is to try and get grant money. ""Lucid has a $1.5 million job-training grant from Arizona and is negotiating a further $5 million grant, according to a spokesperson for the state’s commerce authority. It could also apply for a tax credit program worth up to another $40 million."" This is after burning through BAIC and LeEco. Ford didn't bite. I cannot find the link for the life of me, but they do not qualify for the same type of grants Tesla got, they have already tried fed money. They ended up on Equityzen for bottom barrel, wile CCIV pushes them which brings us to today.

&amp;#x200B;

2019, they just aren't around. Didn't file any paperwork that I can find. !flag

&amp;#x200B;

This stinks of a rotten kickstarter, make claims, more claims, then excuses, and more excuses. The same lines have been said for years. They were going to have cars rolling in 2018, nope. Lies, to provide jobs and all these wonderful things. Solar. Freakin. Roadways. But this gets them the grants to stay around a bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

If you had a SPAC going, it would be super nice if you could get the stock to somehow ramp up to an absurd level, so you can cash out. I mean, that would just be total luck if you knew you were going bust.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think they have any vehicles other than their alpha prototypes that were made way back with BAIC. Every pic / story / article from the last 3 years are all identical. Most of the pics etc I can find are all renderings. I would wager that the ""alpha"" prototype, is from 2017, and it's the only damn thing they have.

&amp;#x200B;

Call it good or bad, but they don't hold anything great for tech. They have failed at auto pilot pretty hard (if they are even bothering to try), and supposedly went with some MS product. I see they have some patents, but this is so.. so.. basic... There is literally nothing new about any of this one [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=10901019&amp;OS=10901019&amp;RS=10901019](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=10901019&amp;OS=10901019&amp;RS=10901019) it's just padded out with random crap just to secure a patent. Again, feels like a stall tactic to me, to show investors \*something\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Casa Grande factory""... Broke ground end of 2019, completed end of 2020. I challenge anyone, to find real pics of something ACTUALLY going on. Not just the same alpha car, not the same pics that it's just a few shells they seem to consonantly being painting. Every article or video, seems like they are surrounded by car shells and just painting them. I can't prove any of this. But I would wager that is one giant empty ass building. I feel I'm just reading the same info pamphlet over and over.

Their time lines, projections, numbers, are never consistent.

EDIT: as /u/RobCornOnCob has shown, ok the plant is not empty. I was just having trouble finding anything other than PR material which was mostly just the exact same statements and photos that they had been putting out for years.

Everything leads back to shell companies.

Lucid Motor’s Casa Grande facility is said to result in approximately 4,800 direct and indirect jobs by 2029. It’s also estimated to produce $32 billion revenue impact for the city and county over 20 years.

Lucid Motors was founded 10 years ago with a different name and mission. Then called Atieva, the company focused on electric car battery technology until 2016, when it changed its name as it shifted to producing electric vehicles.

Draw your own conclusions but this is a quick rundown of what I see. Lucid started out ok as Atieva USA. They tried to move into building EVs. Finance was always the problem, no one would back them, or at least for long. Pulling up the compnays webpage, goes back to 2017. Mostly unchanged over the years. Same vague statements, promises, etc. Lucid only stays afloat by, for lack of a better word, tricking someone into financing them, or, money is government. Looks like they they got AZ caught in the trap. The only play they have is to try and get grant money. ""Lucid has a $1.5 million job-training grant from Arizona and is negotiating a further $5 million grant, according to a spokesperson for the state’s commerce authority. It could also apply for a tax credit program worth up to another $40 million."" This is after burning through BAIC and LeEco. Ford didn't bite. I cannot find the link for the life of me, but they do not qualify for the same type of grants Tesla got, they have already tried fed money. They ended up on Equityzen for bottom barrel, wile CCIV pushes them which brings us to today.

&amp;#x200B;

2019, they just aren't around. Didn't file any paperwork that I can find. !flag

&amp;#x200B;

This stinks of a rotten kickstarter, make claims, more claims, then excuses, and more excuses. The same lines have been said for years. They were going to have cars rolling in 2018, nope. Lies, to provide jobs and all these wonderful things. Solar. Freakin. Roadways. But this gets them the grants to stay around a bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

If you had a SPAC going, it would be super nice if you could get the stock to somehow ramp up to an absurd level, so you can cash out. I mean, that would just be total luck if you knew you were going bust.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think they have any vehicles other than their alpha prototypes that were made way back with BAIC. Every pic / story / article from the last 3 years are all identical. Most of the pics etc I can find are all renderings. I would wager that the ""alpha"" prototype, is from 2017, and it's the only damn thing they have.

&amp;#x200B;

Call it good or bad, but they don't hold anything great for tech. They have failed at auto pilot pretty hard (if they are even bothering to try), and supposedly went with some MS product. I see they have some patents, but this is so.. so.. basic... There is literally nothing new about any of this one [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=10901019&amp;OS=10901019&amp;RS=10901019](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=10901019&amp;OS=10901019&amp;RS=10901019) it's just padded out with random crap just to secure a patent. Again, feels like a stall tactic to me, to show investors \*something\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Casa Grande factory""... Broke ground end of 2019, completed end of 2020. I challenge anyone, to find real pics of something ACTUALLY going on. Not just the same alpha car, not the same pics that it's just a few shells they seem to consonantly being painting. Every article or video, seems like they are surrounded by car shells and just painting them. I can't prove any of this. But I would wager that is one giant empty ass building. I feel I'm just reading the same info pamphlet over and over.

Their time lines, projections, numbers, are never consistent.

EDIT: as /u/RobCornOnCob has shown, ok the plant is not empty. I was just having trouble finding anything other than PR material which was mostly just the exact same statements and photos that they had been putting out for years.

Everything leads back to shell companies.

But we still to get the price from this url. So we're going to use IMPORTXML and search for the last price.

**NOTE:** 1 issue I've already seen is that sometimes you have to multiply by D2 by 1,000 and sometimes 10,000.

Now for a basic call that is not correct is it? Everything I’m reading and watching states I risk my 100 x .17 contract premium of $17 and that is all. Worst case I lose $17 and it’s over. Am I wrong or just stupid?

oblique_strategies_,0.0,22.0,"Here is the data for a couple of puts for SPY which expires on March 19th, 2021 (which is about 38 days from when I'm typing this).

$300|$0.54|0.00957564|$0.54|
$440	| $52.75|0.987618137|$0.46|


I analyzed the daily returns of the S&amp;P 500 for the last 20 years, and I figured out that:

* there's almost a 1% chance that the S&amp;P 500 will reach 3,000 (and, hence, the SPY that tracks it could become 300).
* there's also about a 1% chance that the S&amp;P 500 could reach 4,400 (and, hence, the SPY, which tracks it could become 440).

When a person issues a PUT at 300, they know that the put will never get exercised, and conversely, when they issue a PUT at 440, they know that all these contracts would get called. Therefore, the behavior of these two outcomes are very predictable. It seems that they both also result a very similar profit of only $0.54 and $0.46, respectively, and when I did a baseline calculation to estimate the ROR, I got 1.12%, which is about the rate of a 10-year bond!!! Maybe that's how options are priced initially by some robot. 

Anyways, it's only the other options that are priced more differently.

tirtha2shredder,0.0,21.0,"I started options trading last year. I just received my 1099 from Robinhood today and was surprised to see a ton of wash sales computed for weird reasons:

*  For my positions that I opened for a given stock, if I didn't close them all at ones, the subsequent closes ending up or expiring at a loss, those are marked as wash sales.

Eg: 

Let's say I opened 2 contracts SPY 350C at 10/10, closed each one at a different times. The first one with a loss of $100 and the second one with a loss of $150, the $150 is marked as wash.

The 1099 marks the date acquired as various, when it was all acquired at the same date.

* For option spreads I've opened and closed, it reported all of the losing side as wash while adding all of the winning side as capital gain. WTF is even this?

Eg:

Let's say I opened a TSLA 425/430 call debit spread and closed it for a profit (closed both legs together), it reported all of the gains for the 425C long leg while marking all of the losses from the 430C short leg as wash.

&amp;#x200B;

This has added up to over 25K in wash sales over the past year when my gain shows 15K. Can someone tell me if:

1. I can deduct these wash sales off my filing, because most of these don't make sense at all? 90% of the 25k wash is from the closure of the spreads and closing of options at different dates.

$AI is the ticket symbol for [C3.ai](https://C3.ai), which is an enterprise AI company. They provide a modular AI solution for enterprise companies and have big name clients across the Federal government, finance, and manufacturing.

AI had IPO last Dec that was largely unnoticed. Their IPO price was $42 on Dec 8 that opened to the public on Dec 9 at $100. There was a somewhat quiet response within the first week staying between $90 - $128 but from Dec 15 - Dec 25 it soared from $99 to it's ATH of $183.90. Since then, it has faced lots of resistance around $150 with support around $120.

So let's talk options:

AI only has monthly options, but it's IV is high which is good for selling but can be good for buying if you expect IV to increase. I think it will breakout to $160 - $170 trying to test ATH again, but it's unclear if there will be support for that. I currently have a Feb 19 @ $160 call with a $170 PT.

The main drawback to AI options is liquidity. This is great for sellers as it gives you the opportunity to more or less ask what you want. From a buying perspective, you need to conservative in your entry points because it can rapidly jump due to it's low liquidity resulting in slippage even if you get the direction right.

gohackthat,0.0,18.0,"Hello investors,

(for pictures, please refer to the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/lpaf5w/up_fintech_holding_nasdaqtigr_the_next_robinhood/))

I have been sick for the past week and now I'm back on board. Lots happened in the markets, especially in the rates market, and it'll be very interesting to see what the implications of rising yields are for the risk assets. I will be posting market commentary in the next few days.

In the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/lexatk/up_fintech_holding_nasdaqtigr_the_next_robinhood/), I mentioned that the computed valuation range for TIGR is anywhere between $33 - $47 (\~50% - 100% potential upside), compared to the $26 stock price as of 2/5.

The stock price closed at $36 after-hours this past Friday. I want to note two very important points regarding this.

**1) A good call in the short term is NOT an indicator of success for the long term.**

Whenever you judge someone's investment acumen, including mine, you should NEVER judge anyone based on the success of one's short-term calls or good performance over a two-year period.

Just because I got lucky in catching the ride up in TIGR's stock price movement in the past few weeks doesn't mean I was right nor does it mean that I know where the stock will go in the next few months.

All it means is that the stock is seeing strong momentum in the short-term due to technical reasons. Nothing more.

In the short-term, this could be a good opportunity to benefit from an asymmetric risk-reward profile utilizing an options strategy.

Fundamentally and for the long term, what you should be focused on instead is its 5-10 year growth trajectory and the **reasons** why this company will grow in the future.

If you think about it, it's relatively straightforward.

Say the stock goes from $36 to $100 in the next few weeks. Is that a win for you? Over the long term it may be or it may be not. You will take the profits and reinvest into something else and keep investing forever. Those profits can be easily lost by bad investments we make in the future. The key is **consistency.** And consistency is born out of good research and sound analysis.

As I said in this [memo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), **results and analyses should be independently judged**. Good results on bad analyses don’t mean much, because chances are, you will get bad results in the future based on bad analyses.

2) **Valuations are always subjective and my assumptions in the last memo were fairly conservative**.

You can plug anything you want to come up with a valuation you want. It is important to be able to back those assumptions with qualitative analyses of the business.

Now back to TIGR.

VI. Conclusion

I: **Business Overview**

Tiger Brokers is an online brokerage firm focusing on global Chinese investors. They allow global trading to be done at little or no commissions. You can trade in US markets, Singapore, Southeast Asian countries, and European markets easily.

And as with typical brokerage firms, they earn revenues through two main sources: commission fees and interest income on margins/securities lending, contributing 45% and 28% of 2019 total revenues, respectively.

The company's primary clearing agent is Interactive Brokers, which they rely on to execute, settle, and a substantial portion of the trades of the U.S. and Hong Kong stocks.

Minimum deposit that customers must have to maintain a margin account is $2k.

📷

The company was founded by a Tsinghua University computer science graduate in 2015. It has gained popularity amongst the tech-savvy Chinese millennials, 72% of its customers are under 35 years old, because the company makes it cheaper and easier for Chinese citizens to invest in US-listed stocks. The founder was a former employee at NetEase, a Chinese internet giant.

II: **Thesis I: UI and easy access that are gaining popularity**

With B2C companies, I always try to check out the products/services myself but this time, I scooped up some reviews of Tiger Brokers.

One thing I'd comment about the reviews is to take them with a grain of salt. Even if I personally don't like the app and if lots of people on media have posted bad reviews about the platform, these could be just the minority. The only thing that matters is that the app is gaining traction on average. There will always be haters and people with bad experiences with the apps so as long as the number of users is growing exponentially, we are in the clear.

Below are some reviews.

"" Tiger Brokers stands out because of their low fees and all inclusive digital platform. Their commission costs of 0.08% and minimum of S$0 per trade (until the end of 2020), overtakes [Saxo Markets](https://www.valuechampion.sg/saxo-capital-markets-online-brokerage-review)—who charges a commission fee of 0.08% a minimum of S$10 per trade—as the cheapest provider in Singapore. ""

"" This is due to their simple, clear cut illustration of real-time market data on the SGX, NASDAQ, NYSE and HKEX. ""

UI

📷

📷

Source: [https://betterspider.com/tiger-brokers-review/](https://betterspider.com/tiger-brokers-review/)

At first glance, I think the app is not too different from the US counterparts in terms of the UI. One thing that differentiates the app from Robinhood is that it's got fundamentals data available.

Based on the below graphs, we know that the platform is certainly appealing to the audience.

📷

If you noticed in the graph, while the total number of customer accounts has been growing, # of customers with deposits is only about 1/6 of the total number of accounts.

This gap is due to the process involving account verification, submitting official government identity documents, and transferring US dollars to their accounts (more on this later).

In other words, the rising customer accounts are backlogs of customer accounts with deposits.

However, the management said during the earnings call that they are focusing heavily on an international expansion strategy, with international funded accounts expected to account for more than 50% of paying clients in the next 12 to 24 months.

📷

This is also an important metric to look out for. As long as we see more ammo in their customers' accounts, we can expect to see higher trading volumes in the coming future.

📷

We should also continue to monitor this metric since the company directly derives its revenues from trading volume.

III: **Thesis II: high switching cost and early mover advantage**

I don't totally understand how it works with opening an account in China and actually trading in the account but based on readings, it seems that it is relatively more difficult to do it compared to the US.

It is also apparent that Tiger Brokers makes it easier to do the whole process for the users.

It has been difficult for mainland Chinese investors to buy stocks on Hong Kong or US-based exchanges because the regulations designed to control the value of the Chinese currency limit the purchase of foreign currency up to $50k per person per year.

Tiger Brokers bypassed the need to obtain a Chinese brokerage license, the supply of which is very tight, and allowed its users to trade in US-listed equities. It also requires its users to acquire dollars on their own and transfer them to Tiger's offshore brokerage entities to be able to trade in the US equities.

All of this hassle creates a high barrier to entry for potential competitors as it is legally difficult to invest in global equities in China.

There are still risks from competition such as Futu Holding, which also focuses on Chinese investors. I will talk about that in the Risks section.

It is also one of the earlier movers in the industry. Futu and Tiger are the two fastest-growing brokerages focused on Chinese consumers.

IV: **Thesis III: relatively strong corporate governance**

As with any company, it is critical to look at how the management is incentivized.

At first glance, the management's goals are aligned with shareholders given their 18% ownership in the company.

📷

I briefly mentioned about the founder's background but here are the details from the annual reports. I think it's worth going over them to ensure that it's not a case of a non-tech person with a major in social science venturing into the artificial intelligence industry.

\--

Mr. Tianhua Wu has served as our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and director since January 2018. Mr. Wu is the founder and CEO of Ningxia Rongke since June 2014. Between 2005 and 2014, Mr. Wu served at Youdao of NetEase Inc., where he was responsible for core search. Mr. Wu has received many honors in the business world. He was awarded “Entrepreneurial Elite under 35” in 2016 and “40 Business Elites under 40 in China” in 2017. He currently serves as a director for Ningxia Haozhong Management Consulting Center LLP and Beijing Yian Management &amp; Consulting Co., Ltd. Mr. Wu obtained both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University.

Mr. John Fei Zeng has served as our Chief Financial Officer since October 2018. Between 2010 and 2012, Mr. Zeng worked at the equity sales team of CICC. Between 2012 and 2015, he worked as a Director at UBS Global Capital Market. From 2015 to 2018, he served as an Executive Director in Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at Goldman Sachs, where he was the ECM captain for China fintech and healthcare sectors. Mr. Zeng obtained a B.S. degree in business administration from the University of Southern California and an MBA from New York University.

On April 23, 2020, Mr. Liu informed the Board of his intention to resign, and the board approved his resignation effective on April 27, 2020.

\--

It seems that all the c-suite executives have relevant backgrounds and have extensive experiences in their fields.

V: **Risks**

In my opinion, the most important risk to keep in mind is competition. Futu is currently the biggest threat to TIGR but other than Futu, the rest of the competitors are essentially the established brokerage firms in the respective countries.

I'm not sure if Futu is better or worse than TIGR. What I do know is that both companies are high-quality, fast-growing companies and they could both be winners in the future, just like TD Ameritrade and E\*trade or Uber and Lyft. It's not a winner takes all game like Facebook or Google.

To mitigate this risk, I would split investments into both companies, although I prefer TIGR since it's got much smaller market cap and more room for growth.

Another key risk is corporate governance. It's impossible to tell if this company is cooking up its financials or doing something funky in the background and we should always discount those risks when investing in countries where the accounting risks are higher than the US.

Remember, the US also went through the whole accounting reformation through Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley.

Lastly, the heightened valuation is also a major risk. I am in it for the long term so the current valuation doesn't scare me but I talked about that in detail in Part I. I think it's more important ""that"" you get in on the investment rather than ""when"" you get in, but that's a personal preference.

VI: **Conclusion**

The company has clear tailwinds, including rising disposable income of Chinese households, increasing the proportion of Chinese millennials who are interested in buying US stocks, and greater openness to foreign investments by the Chinese government.

📷

I believe the company will grow at least 10x, if not 50x, in the next ten years and it is one of my favorite picks at the moment.

Upstart holdings will be next. It is a cloud-based lender in the US and I'm just as excited for this company as I am for TIGR.

just_lick_my_ass,0.0,20.0,"Looking for perspective on my idea here. 

My current position: Blackberry (BB) 3,784 shares, average cost $18.75, currently down -$22,210. As you can tell, this is not a fun position to be in. 

Selling weekly covered calls nets me \~$350. I've been using that premium to buy into more shares. I want to expedite this to lower my cost basis more...

In another account I have a couple growth ETFs that have done well over the years, currently worth \~$8,700. I have the idea of selling those, transferring the money into my account with the BB shares, and either 1) averaging down and just buying shares, continue to sell weekly covered calls and do what I've been doing, or 2) take that $8,700 and sell weekly CSPs at $12. Option 2 would bring in about $350 just by selling the CSPs. 

Combining CCs (weekly $19 covered calls) and CSPs, I think would bring me \~$600-$700 to continue to average down on shares. 

Looking for insight on this idea, or any other idea. Looking for a way to use that $8,700 as a tool to work myself out of this hole. 

FWIW, I am long term bullish on BB. So many things happening with them I think they're set up to be big in the long run.

pillarofclouds,0.0,19.0,"Hello guys! So I been studying up on options. Currently call debit spreads. I know I limit my gains but I also limit my losses. So today I felt comfortable enough to do an options call on TLRY, SNDL and APHA. I I did a 55 buy and 65 Sell. All TTM this 2/12.

Well my TLRY completely maxed I only needed it to hit 58.20 for BE. I was looking running my options through a debit credit calculator and I saw that even though I maxed out my 55buy and it is at $67.80(after hrs). The calculator showed that if it stays above my $65 sell each day my profits will get closer to the Maximum Peofits for the trade on Friday. Is the reason why I would not be able to sell now and gain the max profit is because the buyer of my $65 strike sell still needs to see out the whole option trade until Friday to reach his max loss and I realize my max profit?  Not sure I said that correctly but this seems to me to explain why I can’t just excercise my options and closed them out now for the full amount of the debit credit call profit. Is correct understanding?

(I already understand TTM and IV and how that affects the value of the premium the closer the option gets to the expectation date. I think this plays in both directions whether doing a put or a call debit spread.)

I bought 100 shares of Ford and sold a 2/19 call. I did this because:

- I'm happy to own the shares anyway, I feel like F has potential to go up. I've seen some good DD on it.
- Since I'm so new, I want to wade in the shallow end before I swim in the deep. Selling covered calls is a good way to bring in some money. Even if it's called away, I make a bit.

I'm likely going to try a vertical spread next. I want to go with low risk/low reward stuff until I feel more comfortable trading. When I lose money, I'd like it be because the market didn't work for me, not because I did something stupid.

jr2760,0.0,19.0,"I'm feeling really silly today as I'm currently down $12K on a position that should've had a maximum loss potential of $670. Hoping for some advice. Here's the story (TLDR at the bottom):

On Friday I bought 2x TSLA 780c 19Feb21 for a total of $670.

(Yes, these calls were going to expire later the same day)

TSLA didn't recover as I thought it would, and it looked like the calls were going to expire worthless. No big deal, it's only $670.

Well, at the last minute TSLA went up a bit and the calls expired ITM by $1.50. I didn't think much of it until Saturday when I saw I had an extra 200 shares of TSLA in my account and a margin call for over $30K. Still unfazed, I thought ""No problem, I'll just close the position Monday morning. Maybe I'll even be able to make a profit after all.""

Imagine my surprise today when TSLA opens down 2.4% and keeps dropping ALL DAY LONG to a total decline of over 9%. This couldn't have happened on a better day!

To prevent the broker from selling everything, I deposited what cash I could, and sold many of my other positions that didn't drop as far. I sold 25 TSLA shares at $745, and my broker auto-sold another 25 at $734. I managed to satisfy the margin call while still holding 150 of the extra TSLA shares, but my account is now at 99% margin utilization.

I'm currently down $12.4K on this position alone, not to mention the cost of closing my other positions at a loss and having no funds available to buy the dip.

I'm not exactly sure where to go from here. TSLA was already my largest holding, and now it's over 1/3 of my entire net worth. However I'm extremely bullish on TSLA and would've used today's drop to buy more anyway, so I don't see it as that terrible having such a large position.

I'm currently weighing the following options:

1: HOLD! At least until TSLA returns to a price I think is close to reasonable (~$800)

2: TRADE the extra 150 shares for 2 or 3 LEAP calls, and use the leftover funds to reduce margin and buy back the other positions I closed.  I won't miss out on a TSLA recovery and will feel safer having less outstanding margin. But it will hurt to sell at such a large loss.

3: SELL most of the 150 shares, rebalance my portfolio, and significantly reduce margin. This will hurt as well, and severely limits my exposure to a TSLA recovery, but is by-far the safest. (No, I'm not really considering this, but I threw it in for completeness.)

What would you do in this position?

TLDR; Daytraded with $670 worth of call options, that ended up expiring ATM. Broker executes them automatically for $156K which triggers a margin call.

Yes I FOMO'd into APHA and got left holding the bag, I know that wasn't smart but we're here now at 285 @ 23.84/share and I'm making the best of it!

I plan on rounding up to 300 and then writing 3 covered calls with a SP of $29 and exp. 03/12. The contract is $1.22/share so the total premium collected will be $366 and my max profit stands to be 1836.67. Or at least that's what the Fidelity option chain tells me.

I don't anticipate there to be any more stupid FOMO spikes/gamma squeezes, the worst that can happen is that APHA drops to a $8 support level if the $13 support doesn't hold. But I don't see why the price should drop further, before all this TLRY and APHA were undervalued when compared to CGC, and recently the market has finally adjusted. 

My goal is to continue holding my APHA shares until the merger with TLRY because I think TLRY will continue to trade higher than APHA and give holders a favorable appreciation once shares convert. But if the price reaches $29 then I'll no longer be bag holding and I will buy into MSOS because its a superior play in the long term.

Should I try to sell these as weeklies instead? It seems like the longer exp. date is net more profitable. Is there any things I should take into account making this play?

But I don't see why the price should drop further, before all this TLRY and APHA were undervalued when compared to CGC, and recently the market has finally adjusted. 

My goal is to continue holding my APHA shares until the merger with TLRY because I think TLRY will continue to trade higher than APHA and give holders a favorable appreciation once shares convert. But if the price reaches $29 then I'll no longer be bag holding and I will buy into MSOS because its a superior play in the long term.

Should I try to sell these as weeklies instead? It seems like the longer exp. date is net more profitable. Is there any things I should take into account making this play?

gohackthat,0.0,21.0,"Hello investors,

As we await for another tumultuous week ahead, I wanted to share a strategy with the group to help mitigate some of the risks embedded in our portfolios.

Quick reminder, my goal is to share the things I was taught in hopes to not only help educate others but also to remind myself of those key lessons because I often forget them myself.

I understand many people have started trading this past year and that is exactly why I started this forum. I'd hate to see people lose their hard-earned money but more importantly, give up on the game without learning anything.

Two parts to this memo: market thoughts and hedging strategy.

**1) My view on the markets right now.**

Like I mentioned in this memo, this correction is more concerning than the ones we've experienced recently, specifically the September 2020 selloff. It's because of the inflation expectations, rising yields, and Fed's complacency on letting the long-end rates soar, all of which together triggered MOVE index to tick higher. (MOVE index is the interest rate volatility index, similar to the VIX index for stocks)

📷

Not only higher volatility but also a steeper yield curve.

📷

What I also talked about in the memo is that I am not as worried about this correction because of the following reasons.

\- Liquidity in the markets is strong.

\- Fed has been constantly emphasizing its continued support to the proper functioning of the markets.

\- Fiscal spending is not going away.

\- Expected economic recovery

Given the limited data resources, this is the best of what I could find from CapIQ to assess the short-term lending conditions.

📷

Also from what I found on other sources, it seems that the short-term borrowing rates are holding steady, most likely because of the expected cash dump by the Treasury (see the memo for what I'm referring to) and Fed's short-term Treasury purchases.

Not only the liquidity but the Fed and fiscal spending have been the primary drivers of the markets in the past few months, neither of which is going away anytime soon.

Lastly, the expected economic recovery given the vaccine rollout and pent-up demand will likely support the markets for an upward bounce.

Below chart shows the market sentiment as to how bearish the market participants are. It seems to me it's getting more attractive to buy into the markets because the higher the ratio, more bearish the sentiment is.

📷

Ideally, I would want to get charts for FRA-OIS 3 month spread (up to date, most are available as of 2/26), commercial paper spread, and S&amp;P 500 put-call ratio. But what I have right now seems to be sufficient enough to know that we are not headed for a severe market malfunctioning.

C**ombining all of those, I think it's more likely that we are going to see a deeper correction given the technical indicators but I have a very low conviction on this call and we can never time the bottom so my guess is just as good as yours. I do, however, have a higher conviction that we'll see a market recovery and it's wise to slowly buy into dip.** The best way to behave in a correction is to continue to monitor individual names and determine if they're cheap enough to buy or not.

**2) How to hedge yourself**

I should probably have posted this way before to prepare people for a correction like this and my apologies for it.

I will tell you how I try to hedge myself and this is something that works for me but it may not work for others because everyone's risk tolerance is different. Please keep that in mind when you are reading this.

Here's what I typically do. Please realize that this is a rough outline of what I do and by no means everyone should follow these steps.

📷

After a correction of more than 10%, I start buying into the selloff more aggressively. I may be trying to catch a falling knife but I'm willing to risk losing that money for the potential reward in a market recovery.

When the market breaks the previous high and rises a bit more, I start slowly hedging myself by buying short-term debit put spreads.

Here are instances where I bought the hedges.

📷

As you can see, my timing is terrible. I began buying the hedges more than 2 months before the actual corrections happened. As a result, I lost a substantial amount of money through hedges.

Specifically, this is the type of put spread I buy.

Long leg

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 5-10% lower than the current underlying

Short leg:

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 10-15% lower than the current underlying

The idea you are trying to express through the combo of these two legs is that I expect the markets to correct anywhere between 10-15% in the next two months.

If the market corrects more than 10%, I gain on the long. If the market corrects less than 15%, I gain on the short.

The reason why I like this spread more than outright naked puts, straddles, or covered calls is that it requires low capital, you can express your view on the markets better, and it is simpler than other strategies.

**I am no expert in options and I would like to keep things as simple and as easy to understand as possible.**

If you were to execute the said hedging strategy today, here's what I would buy. In fact, I bought this spread on 3/1 when QQQ was $320 and I still have it. I only bought it for no other reason than simply following the 5 steps outlined above.

📷

Long leg: 5/21/2021P $280 $7.67 ask price

Short leg: 5/21/2021P $260 $4.33 bid price

The net premium that I have to put up is $3.26.

It's cheaper than paying $7.67 to buy put option but still protects me just as much when QQQ drops.

This is the performance profile showing what happens today if QQQ moves +/- 10% today or by the expiration date (May 21st), from Interactive Brokers platform.

📷

You can see that if QQQ drops 5% today, I get $184.20 in gains and 10% drop gives me $420.24.

If QQQ is down by 10% by 4/7/2021 instead, a month later, then you gain $385.37 on this spread.

📷

Lastly, we gain $1666 if QQQ is down to $260 by the expiration date 5/21/2021 or lose the entire premium ($334, different from the above mentioned net premium because of mid-price convention) if QQQ is above $280.

📷

The scenarios sound pretty attractive to me. If I expected QQQ to drop from $300 today to $260 today (more than 10% correction), then this spread does a good job hedging. If QQQ closes above $280 (7% drawdown), I only lose $334.

**Now we know which spread to buy but how much should we buy?** The answer depends on how much of the portfolio you want to hedge.

There is a concept called a delta-neutral portfolio. This simply means that if you have a $100k in stocks, you have just as much in options that will offset any gains or losses, thus delta-neutralizing the portfolio.

For instance, look at the long leg we talked about before. 5/21/2021P $280.

📷

We can easily calculate what the ""Delta Dollar"" is for this put option.

You have a delta of -0.238, or -23.8%, and the underlying (QQQ) is $309.

$309 x -23.8% x 100 = -$7,354

Underlying price x delta x multiplier = delta dollar

In plain English, this means that buying the put option is equivalent to shorting $7,354 of QQQ.

So if you have $7,354 in QQQ, this put will make your portfolio delta-neutral. $7,354 in QQQ - $7,354 in put option = 0.

A 1% decline in QQQ will increase your put value by $73.5 (1% of the delta dollar) but will decrease your QQQ shares by $73.5 so it evens out.

As you can see, you gain $82.6 on your put option if QQQ declines by 1%, slightly different than the $73.5 we calculated because delta actually changes as the price of the underlying moves, which is a result of gamma but we won't get into that here and I will cover it in the later series.

📷

**The point is that buy as many spreads as you would like to delta neutralize your portfolio.**

If you are more bullish and only want to delta hedge only 50% of your portfolio, then you would buy enough number of spreads so that the total delta dollar equals 50% of your portfolio.

The good thing is that in most brokerages, there is a column called ""Delta Dollar"" that will calculate it for you, like the one below.

📷

This is not the longer one but the shorter QQQ put spread that I have and as you can see, it hedges $105,575 in dollar terms.

Please note the delta dollar changes every day based on the underlying price moves so if you are buying this spread, you have to frequently monitor the movements to make sure you are properly hedged.

**Summary**

Which leads me to my last point about hedging yourself.

I am a proponent of spending as little time as possible monitoring the markets because I would rather spend time understanding new companies, doing research, or learning some new trading strategy.

If you are buying short-term spreads, by definition you have to spend more time on trading so please keep that in mind.

The point of today's memo was to reiterate my thoughts on the markets and how to hedge yourself in tumultuous times like this.

&amp;#x200B;

They did really well during market hours, and continued to after hours but I still have 18 days left til expiration.

Obviously no one has a crystal ball, but do options traders tend to stick with a formula, website, calculator, etc... that people use to decide when to sell call options that are ITM but have a good amount of time left?  From what I understand, if the stock price stays the same, and the longer I hold them, the less value they'll hold as they approach 3/19.  RKT is up another 6.5% AH so my options should be even juicier by morning, but I dont want to be too greedy.  Do I just decide for myself what % I'm happy with and sell at that point?

-3 3/5 22C which is now current position. 

Yikes! I realized later that this is terrible. I should’ve waited to 0DTE to squeeze out all extrinsic and just do a weekly roll to highest strike I could get for a credit. 

My plan is to wait to near expiration to bleed out all extrinsic, then roll to the next weekly at a higher strike. Repeat until I finally reach OTM. 

I believe the amount of strikes I can go up each week will depend on that weeks IV. So I understand this could take weeks. 

I understand that if APHA rally’s to 75 and then crashes back down to 35 while I’m waiting - there’s nothing I can do.

New-Assumption,0.0,13.0,"My thesis ( I am not a financial advisor) is follow the options market this is how I found RKT! Options are how $tsla kept skyrocketing deep OTM calls slowly getting pushed into the money by delta hedging. This happened with $gme and today with $rkt as well! This is how you would have found other meme stocks with huge potential follow the options!... When calls are very cheap and there are thousands of them expect BIG moves in the stock for SMALL PRICES since options are very leveraged especially deep OTM calls. Also be very mindful of Call/verse put ratios. For ford the calls greatly outright the puts but that's only half the story. The puts that are there are for strikes OUT of the money meaning they are getting weaker and weaker as we get higher and higher!

The $12.50 calls are now in the money as of today and creeping up to the $13 calls once we pass the $13 there is no coming back down IMO! [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F) 16,000+ $13 calls moving ever so close to being in the money giving more gamma to squeeze for this week 3/5 and then next week another 5000+ ... that’s just the contracts for the next two weeks. If you dig deeper the number get insane. 3/19 is also another massive call option day and helps push the gamma squeeze.

To put it into perspective. Today the 3/5 $13 calls started out a .03 cents!!! They got up as high as .18 you literally could have made 6x your money buying the bottom and selling the top and it didn’t even matter if the stock hits $13 by this Friday. Of course no one is that perfect at timing it but hey even if you bought at .05 and sold at .10 double the money in a few hours... or attempt to hold and reach $13 by Friday is very possible so many ways to play the Ford rally!

My Position I thought you'd never ask. 2200 shares 12.50c 3/5 , 13c 3/5 , 8c 6/8

Call options give great insight into bull/bear movement. Remember last week went everything was RED besides Meme stocks?. Ford was down too but very very small % like 2-3% most things were down 10% and then today $Ford skyrocketed up a lot harder than other because it has lots of call options gamma effecting the price. There are almost no puts negatively effect the price. Look at the puts! Almost nothing in the money and the further we get away from $11 and $12 the less those ones effect the price! People were BUYING more calls correctly during that massive RED sell off day last week. Cheaper calls help rocket the stock back up!

Do some research don’t take my word for it. but I’m in ford! 

PS $f also number #1 traded /popular stock on robinhood several days in a row.

Edit my “exit plan” I let the call options ride until expiration date generally unless something dramatically changed with the company. Today we saw a drop down to about 12.20 ... I haven’t sold a single $13 3/5 contract. I’m not scared losing it. Markets go up and down. I believe the data shows promise for $13+ and actually bought some $12.50 and $13 3/12 on this dips. If price were to spike hard and fast to say $15 tomorrow I would trim some options off to cover my costs basis and let the rest ride.

**TLDR: Shortage of supply, and demand goes up. biden help companies increase supply. profitss goo brrrrr. and stock goes to moon** 


AMD and ON are just two of the many companies that produce semiconductors, also known as chips. With the recent shortage of chips due to car companies looking to EV and increased online activity due to covid. There is a huge shortage in the supply of chips and the demand only is increasing.

Biden administration is gooing to write an executive order helping to fund certain companies.



AMD and ON both blew past there earning the last quarter and are being poised for lift off.

1. The new ramp up of need for chips in cars and pretty much everything. The US is actually in a shortage right now due to the increased demand. Car companies have actually estimated they will lose 2 billion dollars (per company) due to the shortages. The big companies that product these chips, AMD, INTC, and like 10 other companies got in a room and smoked some cigars and wrote a letter to Biden Administation asking for incentives to produce more chips. (Pretty much asking for money from the government). They asked for subsidiaries, grants, and tax credits. Making it easily more available to produce large quantities of chips.

Biden's office said that they will be signing an executive order in the coming weeks to address the issue of the shortage of chips. most likely tax credits, or big ass grants to semiconductor producers and designers.

Maventee,0.0,12.0,"I'm thinking through a few strategies for passive income through dividend stocks and wanted to throw a few thoughts out there and see who can pick them apart.

Goal:

\-Protect from potential market down turn

\-Maximize returns

\-Account for tax impact

&amp;#x200B;

Strategy 1:

Buy High dividend stock, \~8-9% div, that reliably puts out dividends.

Sell deep ITM covered calls to reduce basis cost of the stock and to protect from downside risk.

Problems:  Selling calls counts as short term income, so you'd want to limit how far ITM this is as much as possible since it offsets the gains.

Questions:  Does anyone do this with an IRA or something similar?  Would think you could get close to 20% returns this way, if you can avoid the tax impact.

Edit:

 Example: XOM is trading \~54/share. I can sell $17.5 2023 Leaps for $37/share or so (ask is $39). That gives me a basis of \~$17/share and an expected annual dividend of $3.4/share. A roughly 20% dividend payout. 

&amp;#x200B;

Strategy 2:

Buy a high dividend stock as above.

Set up a collar strategy (buy a put, sell a CC) to lock the price in.  Should be able to do this at a \~0 cost.

Problems:  Lose all upside potential, and likely would underperform the market in most cases.

Questions:  Since this locks the price in, and seems very safe, has anyone tried doing this on Margin just to supplement?

disasterlooms,0.0,13.0,"Hi Reddit, I’ve been thinking about the idea of selling options as a way to collect premium in a way an insurance company does. I will preface this by saying that I am new to option trading and my math skills aren’t the best, but I spent some time thinking about how one would calculate expected profit of a put credit spread. The idea being that if you only trade put credit spreads with positive expected profit, you will overall earn money. 

For example, let's say I gave you a 1 dollar bet that has a 25% of winning 20 dollars. If you play this game a hundred times you would lose one dollar 75% of the time but win 20 dollars 25% of the time. Overall you will earn money. But whether or not you earn money depends on the expected return of each bet and the probability of winning. I will attempt the calculate the above with a put credit spread on CRSR expiring on 19/2/2021.

***
**Calculating the expected profit of a put credit spread**

Underlying: CRSR (currently trading at 43.05)

Strategy: 

- Buy 19/2/2021 $30 put

- Write 19/2/2021 $35 put

- Maximum profit: 65 dollars; maximum loss: 435 dollars

Current implied volatility is 101.6 (this represents expected one standard deviation move of the underlying stock price over one year)

Expected one standard deviation move of the price until 19/12/2021 is calculated using the below formula (taken from https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/what-is-volatility/)

https://imgur.com/a/7UASZ5p


Calculated value is 5.51057; that means that the expected one standard deviation move of the underlying until 19 Feb 2021 is 5.51.

Using a normal distribution calculator, the **probability that the underlying price stays above the short strike price of 35 (hence keeping our trade profitable) is 92.8%.** This is based on a mean of 43.05 and SD of 5.51.

The maximum risk of the trade is 435 dollars. The maximum return of the trade is 65 dollars. **Hence the return on investment is 14.9%.** 


The expected profit is calculated as follows: 
(probability above strike price x return on investment) - (probability below strike price)


Giving a positive value of 0.065, or a 6.5% expected return every time this trade is executed. This is positive, so would be a favourable trade for the put credit seller.

***

Wanted to ask any of you more maths savvy traders if anything in my calculation is flawed? And if so, are there any resources I can turn to to refine my calculation? Thanks for reading!


Assumptions I’ve made: 

- That price changes can be modelled as a normal distribution

- Any price above the short strike price results in max gain and anything below is max loss; this is not strictly true that there is gradation in price/loss between the two strike prices, but it made the calculations easier

- Current implied volatility is constant and not changing

Total Position: $881,350 + $403,500 (Realized)


After the sell off from earnings the position went from a high of ~1.1m to ~750k but rebounded recently. 

During the last earnings call Disney+ subscribers were about 95 million as of December 31, 2020. Most likely above
100 million because of WandaVision now. I'll be continuing to hold DIS JUN 18, 2021 160C to their next earnings because I'd like to see the affect of the first Disney+ original Avengers IP will have on their numbers. As for the LEAPS, I'll most likely be holding it until near the end so I can take advantage of the capital gains rate. 


Still bullish as ever as hopes for reopening continue and strength in Disney+ subscribers remain strong. Will continue to update if I change any positions. (If flat towards next earnings, possible making another gamble)

Step 4. FISV EPS was positive, Q4 2020 1.3. And Q4 was better than Q3, Q3 better than Q2.

Step 5. Option price was 0.64 for price at c. 117 2/26 which is under 1. (Break even at 117.64)

Step 6. Evaluating this option, I got 3 days left (Wed-Fri), and break even 117.64 is not new high for them. If FISV kept the double bottom trend as yesterday, then another 2% will make them to 117.9=115.6\*1.02

Step 6. Overall, My decision was based on a. trend b. MA-break-through c. EPS d. option price",think process 0 1 today fisv c 117 2 return step 1 found double bottom trend fisv step 2 yesterday market lot sell fisv candle line good green step 3 yesterday fisv close first time break ma5 ma20 ma50 step 4 fisv eps positive q4 2020 1 q4 well q3 q3 well q2 step 5 price 0 price c 117 2 1 even 117 step 6 evaluate get 3 day left break even 117 new high fisv kept double bottom trend yesterday another 2 make 117 step 6 overall decision base trend b c eps price,99

Amc call options for mid term could be a reliable play given the bullish chart gains it’s been having the last few days. Regardless of if it is a squeeze or not, mid-long term calls on AMC could be quite profitable with possible merger and theatre openings in NYC acting as smaller catalysts.

Please correct me if I'm wrong:

PMCC Directional Assumption: Long-term bullish on underlying stock, with possible short-term stagnation.

Ideal stock/ETFs: More stable, less volatile types like SPY, QQQ, GOOGL etc. are preferred vs highly volatile ones like GME, AMC?

Ideal overall market volatility environment: **I assume** **Low VIX? (Please correct me if I'm wrong as I couldn't find out if VIX should be a factor when doing covered calls)**

Ideal IV environment: Relatively high IV for the short call, while low IV for the long LEAP call (If using PMCC)

DTE: \~1 week to 1 month DTE for the short call, At least 1 year or more for the long LEAP call.

Delta: \~.3 delta for the short call, \~.8 delta for the LEAP.

Stocks near earnings calls: Avoid stocks that are several days before and after their earnings calls due to high volatility. **(Again need to confirm this, and how many days before/after earnings calls should be avoided)?**

In conclusion: Ideally for the stock we want a **low-volatility stock**, but with **high IV for the short call** to earn better premiums.

Despite a rally over the past year, the stock is still undervalued, hasn’t experienced a big run-up, and they’re about to report monster earnings for Q4 ’20 (Feb 25). **Short Term Price Target: $110**

**Covid-19 Growth:**

Over the past year, Crocs has experienced unprecedented sales growth due to increasing demand for comfortable at-home footwear during the pandemic. In 2020, their total revenue was up more than 12%, and they see 2021 revenue growing 20-25% from the previous year ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/crocs-sees-best-sales-ever-with-pandemic-giving-clogs-new-life) ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/crocs-sees-best-sales-ever-with-pandemic-giving-clogs-new-life)%C2%A0)

**Staying Power:**

Customers aren’t just buying Crocs because they want comfortable shoes to wear at home. The clogs have become a fashion statement, partially because of Crocs’ smart marketing decisions over the past year. They’ve done an incredible job reaching new demographics and a younger audience, through strategic partnerships with celebrities like Post Malone, Justin Bieber, and Bad Bunny. 

The company has also tapped top executives from their fashion &amp; footwear competitors, adding to a growing team of top-level talent. Most recently they’ve brought in former Nike executive Emma Minto to be the company’s SVP and General Manager of the Americas, bringing 16 years of executive level experience to the team.

sfjetsetter,0.0,11.0,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Edit 1: Someone asked ""so what’s the current short position? Looks like they some how covered?""

Pasting my response below because I'd like people to see:

I've heard people say 78%, thats still a high number, but personally I made the decision not to care about this percentage from the short interest report released today. Correct me if I'm wrong, that number is generated from data hedge funds submit and hedge funds in this context have every incentive to submit data that would favor their current position. Apparently the fine they get for submitting false is nothing more than a slap on the wrist/a small fine. I also believe hedge funds may have covered some shorts illegally using a loophole to generate synthetic longs to cover with, more on that on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). In addition, there seems to have been [some fuckery](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/) (I recommend you give this a read) with short interest numbers lately so for those reasons I don't place much trust in the current reported short number, and believe the real short interest percentage could be much higher.

Edit 2: A [compelling theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lglkwv/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/gmsll2k/) put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read

Edit 3: If you want to read more about counterfeiting stock this is a good place to start  [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](https://href.li/?http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)",1,Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,11.0,0.83,"Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

So I have seen some recent DD on $ASO, and I wanted to give my own input and dumb it down a bit for people who don't get fancy numbers. I'll keep this ""short"".

==========

**What is $ASO?**

Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors is a fundamentally strong stock that is extremely undervalued with a low market cap and high short interest. Last quarter it beat earnings by 2.4X. The reason it is doing so well is due to the major rise in gun sales, with the third highest-selling month in US history being January 2021. Now, the real reason this is a great short and long term investment is due to the huge short percent of float: [41.18%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ASO/short-interest/)

However, short interest is not enough for a squeeze, so let's look at fundamentals for this stock to get a true understanding of why it is undervalued and why shorts are screwed.

==============

**Fundamentals:**

ASO sells outdoor equipment, with a major part of their sales coming from guns. With the recent Texas opening, gun sales have been through the roof. Gun sales since January are up to [record highs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/). These sales will be reflected in the upcoming earnings, and a catalyst like a second extreme earnings beat can spark a squeeze when shorts try to cover. On top of the record sales, [the firearm background checks are up 30.53% from last year.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view) In short, people are exercising their second amendment right a lot right now.

Furthermore, a large driving factor for ASO is that it is located in the south. As I said, Texas has now opened all business up again, and given the cramped lifestyle of the past COVID year, plenty of people are looking to take up some new outdoor hobbies. [The CEO stated this.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-ceo-says-hobbies-acquired-during-covid-will-continue-to-drive-sales-in-2021-11608054715)

==============

**Financials**

I will restate what another DD from [u/XionTG](https://www.reddit.com/u/XionTG/) had. Let's compare this to another outdoor company that you all know and love: Dicks Sporting Goods.

So let me quote [u/XionTG](https://www.reddit.com/u/XionTG/) and then dumb it down a little:

* ""ASO’s trailing P/E ratio is currently 10.82, as compared to DKS’ 17.56
* ASO’s forward P/E is 9.78, as compared to DKS’ 14.9
* ASO’s P/S (ttm) is 0.41, as compared to DKS’ 0.74
* ASO’s P/B (mrq) is 2.29, as compared to DKS’ 3.15
* Additionally, its most recent actual earnings (0.91 eps) were 2.4x its predicted earnings (0.39 eps), and its predicted earnings for next quarter are 0.48 eps, still well below last quarters earnings ([ASO 23.96 -0.78 -3.13% : Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO?p=ASO)).""

So what do these numbers actually mean?

The P/E ratio is the price-to-earnings ratio. Simply, it measures the share price compared to the earnings. DKS's trailing P/E is valued 1.7X the amount of ASO, and the forward P/E is 1.5X as much, even though ASO is in a better location to capitalize on the rising gun sales and opening of southern states.

The P/S ratio is the price-to-sales ratio. In this case, LOWER is better. ASO is around 55% of DKS' P/S ratio, meaning it is considered a higher value at its current share price as compared to its sales.

The P/B ratio is the price-to-book ratio. That is, it compares the market value of the equity to the book value of the company. In our case, ASO has a more favorable P/B than DKS.

So in summary, based on pure standard ratios to the closest competitor, ASO is undervalued by a significant margin (around 1.5X as a solid guess if you really want a number on it, but that's not exactly how valuation works.)

============

**Short Interest**

Now, this is the juicy part. ASO's short interest as stated is [41.18%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ASO/short-interest/). It has gone up in the past month after earnings, even though its share price has gone up significantly. This means trouble for shorts. Given the upcoming earnings as a catalyst for another price jump, this stock has similar potential to follow $RKT. Furthermore, due to the upcoming stimulus check of $1400 that just passed, we can expect another inflow of money into the market. Now ask yourself, what do a bunch of retail traders who were just loaded up with $1400 do during the saga of hype stocks we have seen in the past month do? Well, they look for the next hype/meme with high short interest. That stock is $ASO, as it is currently the [4th most shorted stock](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest) and one of the only with incredible fundamentals and a catalyst coming up.

=============

**Technical analysis**

So I don't do crayon drawing. I don't believe in it and have found it has been wrong for me in the past. However, if you are interested go and read the DD I mentioned before by [u/XionTG](https://www.reddit.com/u/XionTG/) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwybmb/aso\_dd\_criminally\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwybmb/aso_dd_criminally_undervalued/)

He is more in-depth and will please you high IQ crayon drawers.

==============

**Summary/TL;DR**

**$ASO is both a long-term and a short-term play. It has a very high potential to squeeze due to its high short-interest at 41.18% following its earnings on 4/8. My positions are 16 X $30 4/16 calls.**

**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. Do not construe what I say as financial advice.**",1,"$ASO possibly the next $RKT, here is my DD",13.0,0.64,"$ASO possibly the next $RKT, here is my DD  

So I have seen some recent DD on $ASO, and I wanted to give my own input and dumb it down a bit for people who don't get fancy numbers. I'll keep this ""short"".

I have been getting in the bad habit of buying the cheaper puts in my bull put spreads, thinking only about keeping the margin in my account available to trade.

mushlafa123,0.0,10.0,"I bought a 126 strike price put on amat today. 

I also own 100 shares of amat at 115. I paid $700 for the put option. 

If i understand correctly. I'm expecting some short term weakness in the stock. Would I have just been better off buying otm put? Or just inside the money? I'm super new to options.

https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3246514&amp;headline=FSR-Fisker-initiated-with-an-Overweight-at-Morgan-Stanley

Since the report, it has risen 8.74% in the after-hours, putting it at $16.79. That's a 60% potential gain at a PT of $27.

This stock ran to $23 in November off a $26 pt from Credit Suisse. A couple $15-16 targets sent this into a long accumulation range that its finally ready to break out of.

Fisker has failed previously with car companies specifically, so why is it different this time?

Besides Morgan Stanley, other analysts and research groups have almost unanimously put $FSK as a ""buy"" and a price target well above its current price.

Other equities research analysts also recently issued research reports about the stock.

themop1,0.0,10.0,"I think that someone will try to buy the Meredith Corporation.  It's an ideal acquisition target.

So the story is that Meredith Corporation just earned $3.13 per share with 40.48 million shares outstanding. It reported its highest ever free cash flow for its second fiscal quarter and announced for the first time that digital revenue has surpassed print revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an excerpt from the earnings transcript: With that, let's go into detail about the quarter. Starting with the digital side of the National Media Group, our team delivered an outstanding performance. Digital advertising revenues grew 22% to a record-high $161 \[$161.2\] million. Our multi-year efforts to bring all of our brands together on a single digital platform continues to enable strong consumer engagement, along with growth in advertising and e-commerce revenues.

&amp;#x200B;

Of note, traffic to our digital properties and partner networks grew significantly, with 16% session growth from the prior-year period. Our fiscal second quarter, which includes several holidays, is heavily influenced by food. Allrecipes, the world's largest digital food site, as ranked by Comscore, delivered record performance, with almost 0.5 billion sessions, up 23% from the prior period. [People.com](https://People.com) also delivered record performance and remains the number one destination in the entertainment category. Additionally, our powerful National Media Group brands, led by people and Better Homes and Gardens, delivered strong growth in brand licensing revenues, particularly from our digital relationship with Apple News Plus, along with continued growth from our longtime licensing partner, Walmart.

&amp;#x200B;

Most important excerpt: As a company, one of our key performance measures is free cash flow, and we generated $174 \[$174.3\] million in free cash flow in the second quarter. It was the most free cash flow generated during the second fiscal quarter in our company's 119-year history, and compares to $67 million in the prior-year period.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's very important to understand that the company only has a 1.6 billion dollar market cap. Historically they have traded at a 21x multiple. So if as an investor you only had this earnings period from the company and nothing else the market cap of the company should be about 3.6 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

There are three main factors that have kept investor confidence suppressed over the last year:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Covid

2. Restructuring

3. Uncertainty about digital being a viable revenue source

&amp;#x200B;

So they beat on earnings by 40 percent coming out of a quarter during the peak of covid with yoy revenue growth and digital now representing the majority of their revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

They also own 17 very profitable television stations. They also have over 200 products in Walmart that they designed under the Better Homes and Gardens Brand that are well-reviewed and very strong sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

This company is a treasure-trove of value and imo is worth at minimum 3x its current market cap.

supyeast,0.0,11.0,"I apologize in advance that noobs like myself are flooding your sub. I've read similar posts to my question but I still have no idea what to do and I'd appreciate any input!

I bought 1 Sundial Call. Expires 7/16, $0.5 Call. Break even is $1.55, the average cost is $1.05, so I'm ITM. 

My original plan was to ride this option out until the summer - maybe see a bump after 4/20 and as more states legalize marijuana - and hope it continues rise. But after reading some DD and other posts on here, it seems like weed stocks, or at least Sundial, is about to see a big crash like a pump and dump. 

There's 172% implied volatility, and the Delta is .9839...which I think means the value of my option is almost moving directly in line with the price of the stock. And the high IV means something crazy could happen with this stock/option very quickly, like a massive dip. (Does that check out?)

People seem to recommend selling the option and collecting the profit versus exercising the option. Even if I could exercise &amp; get the stock at a good price now ($1.55/share with my premium included), people seem to think it will dip and I could always get in and exercise a new option at a later date.

So - how would you look at my situation? I could hold it through the weekend and see what happens...I think it could get up to $5/share, I've even heard $10 before a crash. But I've been wrong so many times before - maybe sell this option Friday, or even tomorrow? Or just stop overthinking it and hold it until 7/16? 

I'm a noob, I have major FOMO, this is potentially my first success with options and I don't want to screw this up! Thank you for any help!

flapflip9,0.0,24.0,"Hey,

Given the recent market shake-up (bad time to hold an all-tech portfolio, eh?), it is time to have a grown-up talk on what to do when your portfolio (stocks, funds, etc) is bleeding. If your outlook is still bullish on the underlying, it's a great time to buy the dip.. assuming you have any cash left. You could tap more into your margin, but if the market falls even further, you're just risking loosing even more. Auch. So what else is out there?

1. Panic sell, at least some of your holdings, and hope to buy back again later
2. Try to ride it out &amp; pray to Cthulhu it works out
3. Be like the big boys and try to manage it (unlocking advanced mode)

Let's talk about number 3. You need to hedge, preferably *before* shit hits the fan. But let's be honest, most of us don't bother with that (stonks only go up). So let's do what we can with the tools we have.

Simple setup: say we hold 1000 ARKK, that we bought at 160$/share (just to really really feel the pain). It is now trading at 117$/share, down 27%. We are still bullish, and expect it bounce back by January next year or so, but we can't buy more: no extra cash, family heirlooms, or stimulus check for us.

The plan: sell *some* of the shares, and make option plays to take on additional leverage.

**Basics**

Option pricing follows the Black-Scholes formula, adjusted a bit for tail-risk and market demand. It assumes that on average, it's 50% the stock will go up vs down. Option pricing reflects this belief whether the underlying is at its all time high, or all time low.

To visualize this, here's the [implied probability distribution](https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/en/assets/pdfs/Options_Probabilities_Exhibit_Link.pdf) for the January 21, 2022 ARKK option chain. \[figure&amp;algo is mine; and unlike those crazy kids at Morgan Stanley, I use both put&amp;call spreads instead of silly butterflies that are noisy as f\*ck\]

[ARKK \(implied\) probability density function from January 21, 2022 option chain](https://preview.redd.it/vwkrkca1kol61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4234968cffe63a2973d81d0ec3c26ec477b347ef)

Lot of uncertainty about where it will end up in January next year, with a mean at roughly todays closing price.

But we are bullish, and feel that the *mean of this distribution should be at least 30 points higher*. Just imagine shifting the whole thing to the right a bit. That puts the mean, expected ARKK share price by January 2022 at $147, with some huge potential swings on the up or downside. Why +30 points? Just an exercise. It expects some recovery, but far less than hitting the $160 ATH again.

**Optimal moves**

Using this updated probability density function and brute-forcing a series of possible option plays, here are the optimal plays \[this step means running an algorithm that tries every spread, short strategy, long plays, etc and filtering the ones with the highest risk-adjusted returns; much science goes into it, too long to explain\].

*Explanation: quantities +/- mean going long/short on the option; P/C for put/call; expected returns assume buying at market prices (so Bid or Ask - whichever is least favorable for us) &amp; updated pdf; strategies are normalized for 1 option contract only;*

|Option play|Expected return|Sharpe ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|\+1C $42.96|$2610|0.44|
|\+1C $42.96, -1C $200|$2392|0.53|
|\-1P $42.96|$82|0.83|
|\+1P $42.96, -1P $65|$185|0.58|
|*holding on to 100 shares @ 117$*|*$2798*|*0.47*|

**Closer look A: buying the LEAPS call**

Let's dig into buying $42.96 calls at $76 Ask price. It has a delta of 0.969 and it's deep ITM. It's basically buying shares on leverage. The expected return by strike price + probability of these outcomes are shown here:

[$42.96 Call expected return by strike](https://preview.redd.it/eu1zq1sxyol61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc7194da0ea74ce2d963bf9e5151341f9e08f2b7)

[$42.96 Call expected return adjusted for likelihood](https://preview.redd.it/7jkjf6x2zol61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7be11bc2ef0b954a8ea695da177d26ae8f5ffcb)

Easy, right? So one play would be *selling* 100 ARKK shares for $11.700 total, *buying* 1 $42.96 Call deep ITM January 2022 LEAPS for $7.600 total, with the same expected return as owning the shares (but taking on more risk if the stock drops below $43), and keeping $3.100 cash for further interventions if necessary.

**Closer look B: bull put spread play**

Bull put spread 1P $42.96, -1P $65 looks interesting, for net credit of  $2.50\*100 ($3.80 - $1.30) per contract. Max potential loss is $2.200 per spread ($65-$43 \*100). Or, with pretty figures:

[+1 Put $42.96, -1Put $65 Bull Put spread return by strike](https://preview.redd.it/j3vox1od0pl61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6950260ec9eb99f1f5c1df4078711765503afb5c)

[+1 Put $42.96, -1Put $65 Bull Put spread return adjusted for likelihood](https://preview.redd.it/c2lfzsni0pl61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14d0feac4c5ba41954e209ba735f2ad3b469461a)

So one way to play it would be *selling* 100 ARKK shares for $11.700 total and using it as cover for our put spread. At 25% margin requirement, that gives us a buying power of $46.800, so we can run 21x bull put spreads for a max potential loss of $46.200 and instant credit of $5.250. The credit gained can be used for whatever purpose (say, spending it on LEAPS). You should *not* however touch the proceeds from selling the shares, it is meant as cash protection for your spread until you close the position. The expected return, as per the previous table, is 21\*185$=$3.885 (thanks to the margin play).

In this scenario, we give up on the potentially higher gains of owning the shares/going long on calls for quick cash in return that we can deploy more efficiently.

**Risk management**

You do not want your LEAPS getting anywhere near expiry. With, say, one month to expiry, if the market drops, you loose everything, which wouldn't happen if you own stocks. You want to close your LEAPS when the underlying hits your target forecast. If you still like the stock, buy back shares or even deeper, further dated ITM calls.

**Lessons learned?**

You can ride out the dip in many ways. You could hold on to your shares, or you could take on additional risk by making intelligent option plays and trying to capitalize on this dip/your long term recovery hypothesis.

Choosing the right strikes, expiry dates, rebalancing ratios, etc isn't straightforward (unless you programmed your own tools, you nerd), so do the math &amp; don't rush it (ie: no weekly yolo's to make back all the losses). Deep ITM LEAPS are a good start, and even those can be rolled for higher strikes in case the underlying dips further (doubling down on your position by taking even more risk).

So if your portfolio takes a beating, re-asses your situation and try to make the best of it. May the markets be with you &amp; hope you never need to use any of this.",1,Risk management &amp; riding out the apocalypse,24.0,0.91,"Risk management &amp; riding out the apocalypse Hey,

I have a TSLA 100 share position with cost basis just under 800. I believe in TSLA, but I want to eliminate the scenario where I’m bag holding this over a year. 

I can place a Jan ‘22 +1 510c / -2 800c ratio spread for even money which for next Jan will give me up to 290 in income as TSLA recovers to 800 and or passes it.

An alternative passive strategy is to write a Jan ‘22 leap which would deliver 105 in income.

I like the former as 615 is the break even between the two strategies and I believe TSLA will be above 615 at next Jan. It also gives me some nice upside.

I’m no Chamath fanboy, but the guy’s track record is solid enough where it’s a relatively safe bet that, no matter where IPOF ends up, it’ll be considerably higher than its current $11/share price. There’s not much to say about a mystery SPAC, so I’ll just list some quick notes for the unaware: 

-Chamath’s previous spacs have all done phenomenally well thus far with the exception of Clover Health. In my opinion, IPOF can avoid the pitfalls of Clover Health by merely not being associated with the healthcare industry. We can be relatively certain of that because…

-Richard Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, is associated with IPOF. As is Sarah Leary, cofounder of NextDoor. Safe to say that whatever IPOF is, it has something to do with social media.

-IPOF was once as high as $17.81—50% higher than where it’s currently sitting based off hype alone. Was that price unjustified? Probably. But it could quickly become justified once a merger gets announced.

Note that this is a VERY speculative play. I mean, this is literally a mystery company. Do not be dumb and YOLO on this. Personally, I’m comfortable with 10% of my portfolio sitting in this and won’t put in any more than that. I just doubled down on my $10 December calls and, if a merger is not announced by late 2021, I’ll roll these leaps over to the next year. In my opinion, this stock is a steal at about $11 a share.

Here is my brief DD on why I am deep in TSM

* President Joe Biden is close to signing an executive order reviewing supply chains for critical materials, including semiconductors to pharmaceuticals and rare-earth minerals.
* The global semiconductor chip crisis has compelled U.S. automakers, including Ford Motor and General Motors and other manufacturers, to opt for production holidays.
* The executive order is estimated to seek a 100-day supply chain review in four areas, including semiconductors used in products from cars to phones, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and vital rare-earth elements for technology and defense.
* Interestingly, China rules the rare-earths market and is a major player in multiple supply areas, including pharmaceuticals. The order is timed when the U.S. intends to forge ties with different supplier countries and shun relations with China.
* Major US semiconductor companies have outsourced their chip production to **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** (NYSE: [TSM](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/tsm#NYSE?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site)) and **Samsung Electronics Co Ltd** (OTC: [SSNLF](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ssnlf#OTC?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site)). TSM recently disclosed plans for a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona to come online by 2024.
* The order is estimated to seek a one-year review of supply chains encompassing six sectors, from technology to food production.
* The order will be focused on domestic production with incentives including job-training programs and business loans, including the federal procurement process for more American-made purchases. It will also include certain import limitations.
* The Defense Production Act, covering vaccine production, could also be a part of the order. The government is expected to focus on public-private partnerships while improving relations with allies to address common supply vulnerabilities, including semiconductors.
* The executive order will be linked to Biden’s plans towards U.S. job creation, mainly in the manufacturing sector that has faced intense foreign competition.
* The long-term executive order is expected to incorporate the short-term chip crisis.

bananainbeijing,0.0,9.0,"Hi guys, new poster here, please excuse some of my basic questions, as it's been a while since I've traded options, but I do have experience with them.

I was browsing changes in open interest on Barchart, and saw this: https://imgur.com/a/i4diVu6

There was a huge spike in OI on the 3/19 60C, over 10K new contracts opened yesterday. The fact that they were far ITM made it seem like a bet that the price would continue upwards, as opposed to guessing if it was a CC (not likely here). Also, the fact that it was 10K contracts made it seem like a whale, and I wanted to buy some contracts at the open today and follow this play.

Upon further research today, I saw that CBRE announced their earnings pre-market, and they beat most of their consensus estimates. This helped spike their price from 75 to 80+.

I couldn't get in at a decent price at market open, so I missed out on some potential easy gains. Oh well.

My questions regarding this situation:

1. I checked the volume on IBKR for yesterday, and there was essentially no volume shown for this option contract. Does this mean that the contracts were traded OTC? If so, where is Barchart getting their data from? 

2. Are there any good tools that I can use to track real-time changes in open interest? If I saw this yesterday, I most likely would have jumped in with this whale.

3. Does this smell like insider trading? Taking what amounts to a $15 million long position 1 day before earnings... Or just someone taking a massive bet on a strong earnings from CBRE. CBRE has beat their earnings estimates the past 4 quarters, so maybe it was just a very calculated bet.

Anyway, happy to have a discussion about this, and see what you guys think.

I was ecstatic and felt like the market goddess in bed with me. Somehow I managed to convince myself to cash out $3k, that’s a good decision. 

Then correction started last week. Nearly all my positions are calls, so the portfolio was not pretty. I thought that was bad, then this week started. Lost 25% of my portfolio on Monday, then another 25% today, so far.... Holy fuck.

&gt;David brings a wealth of expertise to this role, having served in a number of senior leadership capacities over the past 14 years at Constellation Brands. His capabilities include extensive CPG and beverage alcohol industry experience, strong financial orientation, and experience operating in highly regulated markets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. David is an experienced strategist with a deep understanding of how to build enduring consumer brands while leveraging operational scale across a dispersed production footprint. He is a strong leader with a proven track record of developing diverse and high performing teams.

In a recent interview, David Klien said *“It's past time that cannabis was legalized in the U.S. We're quite encouraged by Senators Booker, Wyden, and Schumer beginning to talk about making cannabis part of their overall criminal justice reform work that they would prioritize during this Senate,""* - and Canopy Growth has consistently maintained it only needs federal permissibility to launch its U.S. plans.

**Acreage/US Legalization**

In April 2019, Canopy Growth [Announced Plan to Acquire Leading U.S. Multi-State Cannabis Operator, Acreage Holdings](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canopy-growth-announces-plan-to-acquire-leading-us-multi-state-cannabis-operator-acreage-holdings-300834628.html)

[Acreage Holdings ](https://www.acreageholdings.com/about-us/) cemented its place as an industry game-changer during this period. Board appointments from across the political and commercial spectrum helped legitimize cannabis among investors and regulators. Press coverage of the broadcast TV rejection of our “Time Is Now” Super Bowl PSA, which called for further cannabis reform, reached billions. We began rolling out our house of brands, including consumer brands like The Botanist and Live Resin Project, both of which took home honors at the Emerald Cup, the premier product competition in cannabis. And we entered an arrangement with Canopy Growth Corporation, setting the stage for a combined global cannabis powerhouse once it’s federally permissible for Canopy to acquire our company

The new — and complicated — agreement, which would allow Canopy to buy Acreage once pot is federally legalized in the U.S., follows broader efforts by both companies and North American's legal marijuana industry to cut costs and shrink their footprint.

&gt;Canopy CEO David Klein said the move ""reflects Canopy Growth's commitment to focusing our efforts on the United States as one of our three core markets. Acreage continues to be Canopy's main point of entry into the largest THC marketplace in the world when federally permissible.""

Under the new deal, Canopy would not have to buy as much of Acreage. It would be obligated to buy only 70% of Acreage whenever the U.S. legalized cannabis, Acreage said.

Fixed Acreage shares will be exchanged for 0.3048 shares of Canopy, down from 0.5818 previously. Canopy Growth has the option to buy the floating shares for a price of at least $6.41. Shareholders also get a $37.5 million one-time payment. Canopy will also loan up to $100 million to a subsidiary of Acreage.

I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/laaih5/weedstocks_us_legalization_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) in regards to my bullish stance on US Legalization &amp;amp; and the oppotunities ahead.

1) Can you please describe the relationship with Canopy?  CGC's investor presentation has TerrAscend as a key pillar to their US strategy yet I believe they own or will own less than 30%...Sounds to me that Canopy will want to acquire a controlling interest as soon as legally permitted?  Is that accurate?

&gt;Canopy owns about 20% of the company on an as converted basis. We have a great relationship and were flattered that they highlight TerrAscend as a key pillar. In terms of whether they want to acquire controlling interest in the company, you'd have to ask them. 

2) too add on to this.. Like mentioned above, TER is a key pillar to Canopy’s US strategy, but does that fit both sides of the coin?

&gt;Yes, the relationship is mutually beneficial. We talk to them regularly. They have alot of great insight and are generous with their time and resources. For example: Their advice has been very helpful as it relates to our buildout in New Jersey.

In a recent [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/lkne5r/terrascend_ama_february_19th_530pm_et_with_ceo/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), Jason Ackerman (CEO) &amp;amp; Jason Wild (Board Chair) answered a few questions in regards to the Canopy deal.

1) Can you please describe the relationship with Canopy?  CGC's investor presentation has TerrAscend as a key pillar to their US strategy yet I believe they own or will own less than 30%...Sounds to me that Canopy will want to acquire a controlling interest as soon as legally permitted?  Is that accurate?

&gt;Canopy owns about 20% of the company on an as converted basis. We have a great relationship and were flattered that they highlight TerrAscend as a key pillar. In terms of whether they want to acquire controlling interest in the company, you'd have to ask them. 

2) too add on to this.. Like mentioned above, TER is a key pillar to Canopy’s US strategy, but does that fit both sides of the coin?

&gt;Yes, the relationship is mutually beneficial. We talk to them regularly. They have alot of great insight and are generous with their time and resources. For example: Their advice has been very helpful as it relates to our buildout in New Jersey.

**TODAY**, Gov. Phil Murphy officially legalizes weed in New Jersey:

3) Do you guys speak with the Acreage team much? (They have some assets I would love to see in your hands, I’m sure canopy prob would too lol)

&gt;We have a great relationship with them

thewateroflife,0.0,11.0,"I put this together this weekend after taking a quick look at some stocks and noticing a special period for options.

Taking for example your typical shorted company stocks there's a long downtrend with a few upswings, some recent rises being brief and spectacular.

For instance the underlying data for AMC is messy. The intense January jump made it worse. Market timing is everything and when leveraging options there should be a nice place to get in just before the next big movements start.

All the charts I know of weren't working for me so I created my own.

[https://imgur.com/kSnkMnf](https://imgur.com/kSnkMnf)

This is a sort of smoothing of effects for the stock data for AMC. I only care if each week is higher or lower, and gave stronger colors to higher movements between closing and opening. What this chart shows is that it regularly undergoes shorting for 3-4 weeks, hits a dead lull, then trends up.

Most outstanding to me are the LULLS. These are typified by the end of a 3-4 week downtrend, punctuated by a dead stop, where from open to close of the week the stock did not move from the prior week.

AMC is currently in a such a lull which is a prime market for options pickups or cheap stock buys. If following a pattern then it will rise quickly at first starting this week for a good short options play. If the movement is less quick to the upside early, it will break higher in the third week. If week 4 does not show the typical increased volatility, it could be a potential break out indicator as shorts move away.

Does the chart make sense, is it a good tech analysis?

My question is, would it make more sense to sell a short put, like the $12.5 3/19 @$4.80? Even if I get assigned, my cost basis on the stock becomes $7.70. If the stock rises like I think it will, I just keep the $480 and do another for April.

Neither-Willingness9,0.0,10.0," 

ive a question on ITM vs OTM options.

look at this scenario, assume price of Stock $X is trading at $8 and it comes down to $6 and i know with certainty it will go to $12.

Options trade:

Risk of $1000, basing premium paid as total risk allocated to this trade, i buy calls on $X when price of stock is at $6.

buying ITM or OTM options at same expiry will generate more profits if price reaches target of $12?

I know OTM are cheaper and since im risking a fixed amount, $1000 in this example, i can buy more OTM than ITM, but ITM has a much higher delta and when price moves in my favor, the option increases in price more.

In ROI terms, OTM may generate more but what about absolute terms? if prices touches $12 which one would ultimately give me more in dollars amount??

seems like the only advj of OTMs are if price were to spike up quickly, the calls tend to appreciate more? Ie. OTM has higher vegas?

Auriokas,0.0,9.0,"Hello everyone, 
I am swing trading stocks/options for a while now. Regarding options I usually buy them and pay only the price which I can afford to loose (1-3% from whole portfolio). Despite that I am usually missing out on huge gains because I buy pretty small number of contracts. Currently I am thinking alot about 3-6 months LEAPS on stocks/SPACS while replacing my whole stock portfolio with only options. Since instead of having 5K of shares I will have 5K in options per position - rewards are much more appealling. Nevertheless the factor of controlling the risk more preciselly kicks in here. It is easy with stocks - stop limit at all times including after/pre market hours and you can sleep well. But what about options? Spreads ar kind a big, option prices move fast and only during open market hours - your stop loss can be jumped over. So I am really interested in your insights guys ( who are investing in LEAPS instead of shares):
1. How do you manage your risk if option price is much bigger than you can afford to loose? Stop limits on options, is it reliable? 
2. Is it worth trying? Why I should not replace 30 K of stocks with LEAPS only which will probably be equivalent of 2x/3x that the shares gives (60-90K)?

Optimal_Challenge_92,0.0,8.0,"Traded options for a while but pretty basic strategies - mostly just buying calls or puts - a few cash secured puts and some covered calls. 

I have a large DITM leap call position and I have been thinking of selling shorter term 25-30% OTM strike calls against them to collect some premium while I am holding them. 

Worse case scenario I see is if the strike gets hit then I have collected the upside to that price and have to just cover the difference up to the strike of the leaps I own if called. 

I get a little bit of downside protection if it moves the other way as the case would be with plain old covered calls.

Am I missing anything here? Haven't done much trading with spreads so I just figured I'd ask the internet and see how it feels.

gh424,0.0,8.0,"I am a firm believer in selling 30 delta puts 30-45 DTE on just about anything that has a reasonably high IV percentile. High probability of profit and decent return on capital, especially in a margin account.

Here is my “no loss” strategy. 
1) hold to near expiration and buy back 70% of the time
2) if the underlying changes dramatically and the put goes ITM. Buy the same strike call on the same expiration (should be less than what you received for the put, in theory given time decay and the fact that it is OTM). Then find your cost basis (underlying price - put premium received + call premium paid). Sell an at cost basis call. Follow the trend and if the underlying continues to drop, keep rolling down the sold calls as the price drops being sure to stay at or above your calculated cost basis.

At the end you will receive 100 shares from your synthetic long position and then the shares will be called away from your sold call OR you have the shares at a super low cost basis and you could sell 30d covered calls OR just sell the shares for a profit.

zephyrtaru,0.0,7.0,"I am curious as to what may be the common approach on risk management when it comes to undefined-risk trades such as selling strangles or naked calls/puts, especially in the context of rolling. 

For example, let’s say hypothetically I enter a short strangle trade with initial premium of $10, or $1,000 per contract. At the time of the entry, I set a mental stop of 2x premium, or agreeing to lose at most $2,000; ie when the market value of the pair rises to $30. 

After entry, underlying moves against me with an unexpected jump that threatens the call side. I roll up the put to manage delta and collect an additional $2 premium. The next few days, the market continues to move against me and actually breached the call side. I roll up the put and turn the pair into a straddle, collecting $3 in premium. Throughout this ordeal, of course, IV has been happily heading higher; and despite collecting a total of $15 in premium, the market value is now at $31 for the (now) short straddle. 

If I exit and bank the loss, I would be executing the originally designated stop, because the price had moved beyond the original target. However, when accounting for rolling I am only (in total and net) realizing a loss of $16, lower than the original stop loss.

Bulky_Mall_2128,0.0,9.0,"**Synopsis:** I believe Upwork (NAS: UPWK) is going to be a strong long-term play through this year. Upwork possesses strong fundamentals, is relatively undervalued compared to its growth-stock peers, possesses a unique hold over its market, and is well-positioned within an exploding market place.

**Background: What is Upwork's Market?** 

Upwork is a company within the professional *freelancing space*. For some background, freelancing is a modality of employment where people may participate in jobs of any duration, complexity, and tasks. 

**Where is the value in Freelancing?**

*Employer's Perspective:* 

* For small/medium businesses, it is *very difficult to find skilled employees* for unique task/jobs without spending a lot of money, resources, and time.
   * It is often impractical, if not impossible, for small businesses to finance the hiring of an entire team of employees when there is limited work, limited capital, and high risk 
   * Most jobs/tasks require less than a few hundred hours of work, so it would be ridiculous to attempt to hire employees for simple tasks. Yet, the tasks are often too sophisticated for the business owner, and they often lack time, so it is necessary to hire employees  
* Many skilled independent consultants charge high premiums, especially within big-five countries, as it is too difficult to balance self-marketing and work in a manner which is more lucrative than a stable job
* Remote independent contractors require no work space, no benefits, and no additional complicated employee taxes
* It is often very risk to simply \*hire\* employees, as scams, fraud, and poor-quality work is rampant 

*Employee's Perspective*

* As a skilled employee within a big-five country, stable jobs often limit upside-potential, underpay for potential, restrict flexibility, and are not feasible as ""side-gigs"" for extra cash
* For individuals with niche skills, it is often overwhelming to market oneself and attempt to find work. Often this requires a significant time investment which evolves from a side-gig to a side-job, which is too much to handle. 
* As a skilled international employee outside the US/Europe, it is often very desirable to freelance for employers of different companies, as pay-rates are significantly higher.
* Since the COVID pandemic, remote work has become more normalized and very attractive
* American education is becoming very expensive, and many young, skilled workers in fields such as engineering, software development, data science, etc are finding it difficult to find work. Even if independent contracting isn't a primary job, it is a very lucrative and flexible way to subsidize income.
* It is often risk to perform work for employers, as many businesses are notorious for changing their mind about work after the employee has already invested time and resources, and there is a high rate of fraud.

**What Value Does Upwork Offer?**

* Upwork is an online freelancing platform for small-large businesses to find professional freelancers for their business. 
   * Employers post listings which detail descriptions of jobs. 
   * Employees may ""bid"" on jobs by offering quotes which estimate the time and price of the job. Often, these quotes are only invisible to employers.
      * Jobs may be paid in a fixed-fees or on an hourly basis
   * Employers may then select an employee by reviewing employee profiles (which feature ratings, employee verification/skill badges, and past work) as well as their quote, and initiate a chat/video conversation through the platform.
   * Once the employer and employee reach a deal, the employer deposits money within the Upwork escrow in the form of ""milestones""
   * Upwork provides an optional software tool that employees may download to track/log their work automatically
   * As the employee completes the work, milestones are then released or hourly wages are automatically invoiced through Upwork
   * Upwork allows employers/employees to track payment and progress
   * If a job goes side-ways and an employer/employee flakes, Upwork has systems to help refund the employer or pay the employee by having control over the Escrow
   * Once the job is complete, both parties leave ratings for each other. 

In essence, they function as the middle-man between freelancers and businesses, providing a platform with a marketplace for freelancers and businesses to connect, a reliable Escrow service, strong anti-bot protection, employee identity verification, skill assessments, text/video chat features, workplace monitoring tools, and workplace payment tools.

Special Notes:

* Upwork has an identity-verification program to verify the identities of employees by live video chats and brief interviews
* Upwork has strong anti-bot protection which is very strict on following rules
* Upwork bans any users which its machine learning algorithms detect are trying to migrate work off the platform
   * Although one might see this as the fatal flaw of Upwork, job migration is very uncommon, as it is extremely hard to create a new account without falsifying bank statements, passport information, etc. accounts 

**How Does Upwork Stand Against Its Competitors?**

*Preface:* One important piece of information to understand, speaking as a veteran within Freelancing, is that within Freelancing, it is not like technology where people experiment with the next shiniest product: freelancing has a lot of competition, so employees drift to the marketplace with the most jobs, and employers naturally drift to the market place with the most employees. This is important, as my faith in Upwork is more so rooted in its current thriving and competent marketplace rather than some unique technological innovations. This is a very strong positive, as new freelancers and businesses are naturally going to google ""Freelancing"" or ""Find work"" and join the place with all the jobs -- not the company with the slightly shinier work place buttons.

Upwork two main competitors: *Fiverr* and *Freelancer*

* *Fiverr:* 
   * This name gets thrown around a lot as a competitor to Upwork. In my opinion, this makes absolutely no sense. Fiverr is a great litmus test for freelancing and does a great job in cute side-gigs, but it is a place where freelancers market services to people -- not people requesting jobs for freelancers. 
      * This makes it a unique platform, but it is substantially different than Upwork
      * In my experience, Fiverr is riddled with teenagers offering miscellaneous small-tasks, and with the occasional professional offering premium services. 
      * This is not a place for businesses to find employees or for employees to find work. 
      * Having been an employer of over 100 freelancers across numerous jobs, I have yet to encounter a single one that felt Fiverr was more attractive for their work.
      * The proof is in the pudding: there are almost no people that make a living off Fiverr, but there is a rapidly growing number of people making a living off Upwork.
   * Fiverr, nevertheless, has been very successful, and it has still attracted the attention of many small businesses. 
   * This, to me, is a very strong indicator that there is massive potential within the market.
* *Freelancer*
   * Freelancer is indeed a much more comparable company to Upwork, offering an online marketplace for employers to post jobs with similar features of Upwork
   * Having a lot of experience within this space, however, Freelancer, has continuously turned out to be a disappointment.  Freelancer is saturated with bots, largely dominated by international fraudulent/low-value job listings, and features a markedly worse workforce. 
   * Having worked with many Freelancers, the most common request I get is to migrate my job to Upwork, as they experience much better employers, pay, and treatment there.
   * Freelancer has very poor anti-bot protection and almost never bans Freelancers. If banned, making new accounts are trivial.
   * Overall, Freelancer may have the same functionalities at face, but Upwork is to Freelancer as Amazon is to Ebay -- one is premier (albeit with some flaws) while one is often junk.

**Upwork Growth Potential:**

Upwork's revenue has been steadily increasing year-over-year, from $223,000,000 in 2018 to $268,000,000 in 2019 to $338,000,000 in 2020. While one could argue its revenue was helped by COVID, I posit that the popularization of at-home work through Youtube, COVID, and social media has made it very attractive in the long-run. After all, freelancing is very much a critical-mass issue, where now that Upwork has sustainably attracted numerous new employers, there is sufficient work to attract more employees and more employers.

Upwork is mostly an online business, so its books are good with a Current Ratio of 1.82 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08. 

While Upwork's EBIDTA is holding steady at around $14,000,000, we see its ""Sales and Marketing"" have shot up from $72,000,000 in 2018 to $133,000,000 in 2020, and ""Administration"" and ""R&amp;D"" have likewise increased year-over-year to absorb the increasing revenue. 

Knowing the number of customers is rapidly increasing on Upwork (from 105,000 core customers in 2019 to 145,000 core customers in 2020), this is very positive in my opinion, as this is not an indicator of Upwork struggling with a high CAC, but it is instead telling that they are aggressively pushing for market-share, as employees/employers are king in Freelancing.

Moreover, Upwork's escrows report $135,000,000 for 2020 and $108,000,000 in 2019, indicating money is steadily growing into their markets.  

With jobs poised to rapidly increase as the economy reopens, I would expect much more activity within Upwork. I have personally observed substantially more rich listings appear since last February. They even note this decline of jobs due to COVID within their 10-K, ironically suggestion that despite COVID popularizing remote work, the best is yet to come.

Interestingly enough, Fiverr has nearly the same types of financials (low EBITDA, high push for marketing, steadily rising customers), but it is trading at a (40.71 EV/revenue, 37.2 price to sales, and 411 price/cash flow) and as opposed to Upwork's (11.84 EV/revenue, 14.06 price to sales, and 234 price to cash flow). As a result, Upwork is currently trading around $44 while Fiverr is trading around $218.

While their are definitely differences between the companies, I suspect a big component of this is the popularity of Fiverr, as it was popularized a few years prior to Upwork. However, seeing Upwork's steady growth, seeing how its financials compare to Fiverr, and seeing how its EBITDA will skyrocket the moment they ease up on R&amp;D/Sales&amp; Marketing (much like Amazon's strategy), I believe it can definitely reach $100+ within 1-2 years.

**Pros:**

* Dominating marketplace with high switching costs
* Low EBITDA/profit financials are due to investment into software and securing marketplace (much like Amazon)
* Financially comparable to FIVERR which trades at around 5x UPWK's value
* Provides very valuable and justifiable services to employees and employers
* Poised to benefit from economic recovery

Upwork possesses strong fundamentals, is relatively undervalued compared to its growth-stock peers, possesses a unique hold over its market, and is well-positioned within an exploding market place.

**Background: What is Upwork's Market?** 

Upwork is a company within the professional *freelancing space*. For some background, freelancing is a modality of employment where people may participate in jobs of any duration, complexity, and tasks. 

**Where is the value in Freelancing?**

*Employer's Perspective:* 

* For small/medium businesses, it is *very difficult to find skilled employees* for unique task/jobs without spending a lot of money, resources, and time.
   * It is often impractical, if not impossible, for small businesses to finance the hiring of an entire team of employees when there is limited work, limited capital, and high risk 
   * Most jobs/tasks require less than a few hundred hours of work, so it would be ridiculous to attempt to hire employees for simple tasks. Yet, the tasks are often too sophisticated for the business owner, and they often lack time, so it is necessary to hire employees  
* Many skilled independent consultants charge high premiums, especially within big-five countries, as it is too difficult to balance self-marketing and work in a manner which is more lucrative than a stable job
* Remote independent contractors require no work space, no benefits, and no additional complicated employee taxes
* It is often very risk to simply \*hire\* employees, as scams, fraud, and poor-quality work is rampant 

*Employee's Perspective*

* As a skilled employee within a big-five country, stable jobs often limit upside-potential, underpay for potential, restrict flexibility, and are not feasible as ""side-gigs"" for extra cash
* For individuals with niche skills, it is often overwhelming to market oneself and attempt to find work. Often this requires a significant time investment which evolves from a side-gig to a side-job, which is too much to handle. 
* As a skilled international employee outside the US/Europe, it is often very desirable to freelance for employers of different companies, as pay-rates are significantly higher.
* Since the COVID pandemic, remote work has become more normalized and very attractive
* American education is becoming very expensive, and many young, skilled workers in fields such as engineering, software development, data science, etc are finding it difficult to find work. Even if independent contracting isn't a primary job, it is a very lucrative and flexible way to subsidize income.
* It is often risk to perform work for employers, as many businesses are notorious for changing their mind about work after the employee has already invested time and resources, and there is a high rate of fraud.

**What Value Does Upwork Offer?**

* Upwork is an online freelancing platform for small-large businesses to find professional freelancers for their business. 
   * Employers post listings which detail descriptions of jobs. 
   * Employees may ""bid"" on jobs by offering quotes which estimate the time and price of the job. Often, these quotes are only invisible to employers.
      * Jobs may be paid in a fixed-fees or on an hourly basis
   * Employers may then select an employee by reviewing employee profiles (which feature ratings, employee verification/skill badges, and past work) as well as their quote, and initiate a chat/video conversation through the platform.
   * Once the employer and employee reach a deal, the employer deposits money within the Upwork escrow in the form of ""milestones""
   * Upwork provides an optional software tool that employees may download to track/log their work automatically
   * As the employee completes the work, milestones are then released or hourly wages are automatically invoiced through Upwork
   * Upwork allows employers/employees to track payment and progress
   * If a job goes side-ways and an employer/employee flakes, Upwork has systems to help refund the employer or pay the employee by having control over the Escrow
   * Once the job is complete, both parties leave ratings for each other. 

In essence, they function as the middle-man between freelancers and businesses, providing a platform with a marketplace for freelancers and businesses to connect, a reliable Escrow service, strong anti-bot protection, employee identity verification, skill assessments, text/video chat features, workplace monitoring tools, and workplace payment tools.

Special Notes:

* Upwork has an identity-verification program to verify the identities of employees by live video chats and brief interviews
* Upwork has strong anti-bot protection which is very strict on following rules
* Upwork bans any users which its machine learning algorithms detect are trying to migrate work off the platform
   * Although one might see this as the fatal flaw of Upwork, job migration is very uncommon, as it is extremely hard to create a new account without falsifying bank statements, passport information, etc. accounts 

**How Does Upwork Stand Against Its Competitors?**

*Preface:* One important piece of information to understand, speaking as a veteran within Freelancing, is that within Freelancing, it is not like technology where people experiment with the next shiniest product: freelancing has a lot of competition, so employees drift to the marketplace with the most jobs, and employers naturally drift to the market place with the most employees. This is important, as my faith in Upwork is more so rooted in its current thriving and competent marketplace rather than some unique technological innovations. This is a very strong positive, as new freelancers and businesses are naturally going to google ""Freelancing"" or ""Find work"" and join the place with all the jobs -- not the company with the slightly shinier work place buttons.

Upwork two main competitors: *Fiverr* and *Freelancer*

* *Fiverr:* 
   * This name gets thrown around a lot as a competitor to Upwork. In my opinion, this makes absolutely no sense. Fiverr is a great litmus test for freelancing and does a great job in cute side-gigs, but it is a place where freelancers market services to people -- not people requesting jobs for freelancers. 
      * This makes it a unique platform, but it is substantially different than Upwork
      * In my experience, Fiverr is riddled with teenagers offering miscellaneous small-tasks, and with the occasional professional offering premium services. 
      * This is not a place for businesses to find employees or for employees to find work. 
      * Having been an employer of over 100 freelancers across numerous jobs, I have yet to encounter a single one that felt Fiverr was more attractive for their work.
      * The proof is in the pudding: there are almost no people that make a living off Fiverr, but there is a rapidly growing number of people making a living off Upwork.
   * Fiverr, nevertheless, has been very successful, and it has still attracted the attention of many small businesses. 
   * This, to me, is a very strong indicator that there is massive potential within the market.
* *Freelancer*
   * Freelancer is indeed a much more comparable company to Upwork, offering an online marketplace for employers to post jobs with similar features of Upwork
   * Having a lot of experience within this space, however, Freelancer, has continuously turned out to be a disappointment.  Freelancer is saturated with bots, largely dominated by international fraudulent/low-value job listings, and features a markedly worse workforce. 
   * Having worked with many Freelancers, the most common request I get is to migrate my job to Upwork, as they experience much better employers, pay, and treatment there.
   * Freelancer has very poor anti-bot protection and almost never bans Freelancers. If banned, making new accounts are trivial.
   * Overall, Freelancer may have the same functionalities at face, but Upwork is to Freelancer as Amazon is to Ebay -- one is premier (albeit with some flaws) while one is often junk.

**Upwork Growth Potential:**

Upwork's revenue has been steadily increasing year-over-year, from $223,000,000 in 2018 to $268,000,000 in 2019 to $338,000,000 in 2020. While one could argue its revenue was helped by COVID, I posit that the popularization of at-home work through Youtube, COVID, and social media has made it very attractive in the long-run. After all, freelancing is very much a critical-mass issue, where now that Upwork has sustainably attracted numerous new employers, there is sufficient work to attract more employees and more employers.

Upwork is mostly an online business, so its books are good with a Current Ratio of 1.82 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08. 

While Upwork's EBIDTA is holding steady at around $14,000,000, we see its ""Sales and Marketing"" have shot up from $72,000,000 in 2018 to $133,000,000 in 2020, and ""Administration"" and ""R&amp;D"" have likewise increased year-over-year to absorb the increasing revenue. 

Knowing the number of customers is rapidly increasing on Upwork (from 105,000 core customers in 2019 to 145,000 core customers in 2020), this is very positive in my opinion, as this is not an indicator of Upwork struggling with a high CAC, but it is instead telling that they are aggressively pushing for market-share, as employees/employers are king in Freelancing.

Moreover, Upwork's escrows report $135,000,000 for 2020 and $108,000,000 in 2019, indicating money is steadily growing into their markets.  

With jobs poised to rapidly increase as the economy reopens, I would expect much more activity within Upwork. I have personally observed substantially more rich listings appear since last February. They even note this decline of jobs due to COVID within their 10-K, ironically suggestion that despite COVID popularizing remote work, the best is yet to come.

Interestingly enough, Fiverr has nearly the same types of financials (low EBITDA, high push for marketing, steadily rising customers), but it is trading at a (40.71 EV/revenue, 37.2 price to sales, and 411 price/cash flow) and as opposed to Upwork's (11.84 EV/revenue, 14.06 price to sales, and 234 price to cash flow). As a result, Upwork is currently trading around $44 while Fiverr is trading around $218.

While their are definitely differences between the companies, I suspect a big component of this is the popularity of Fiverr, as it was popularized a few years prior to Upwork. However, seeing Upwork's steady growth, seeing how its financials compare to Fiverr, and seeing how its EBITDA will skyrocket the moment they ease up on R&amp;D/Sales&amp; Marketing (much like Amazon's strategy), I believe it can definitely reach $100+ within 1-2 years.

**Pros:**

* Dominating marketplace with high switching costs
* Low EBITDA/profit financials are due to investment into software and securing marketplace (much like Amazon)
* Financially comparable to FIVERR which trades at around 5x UPWK's value
* Provides very valuable and justifiable services to employees and employers
* Poised to benefit from economic recovery
* Steady growth and customer acquisition
* Considering ""premier"" among many Freelancers
* Companies have changed many positions permanently to remote, and COVID has normalized remote work
* Transition towards tech in industry is ideal for remote work 

**Risks:**

I would be remiss not to mention any risks in mind, as there are always of course risks.

The price tanked hard so I thought it was worth dropping the strike down?",buy close cc sell high strike premium hey guy pretty new do fair bit buying call newish sell cover call sell two spce make expiration 3 buy back sell two new one 3 make profit valid strategy price tanked hard thought worth drop strike,45

Let's say you are trading the 1SD or .16 deltas on each side, 45DTE managing winners with 50% profit.

Then you get tested on the Call side, rolling the untested side to get back on the 0.16 delta, and collected more premium.

Do you also roll the tested side away but same expiration?

I only see them mentioning rolling the untested side and hold til expiration. Wouldnt that tested side get called before expiration specially if it keeps on moving more in the money?

YouThinkImPlayin,0.0,8.0,"I've been noticing more and more than the techs have extremely low IV right now, perhaps partially skewed by last March/April, but nonetheless at or near their 1-year lows. High premium is hard to collect on a lot of stocks, and who wants to sell Puts right now when markets are near all-time highs?

One idea I've been having success with recently is 30-45 DTE Long Iron Condors, which benefit two-fold from a market nosedive and spike in IV. Some potential plays: AMZN, NFLX, FB, TSLA, BA. From least to greatest, NFLX has an IVR of 4.5, with TSLA claiming the highest IVR (15.3), which is still quite low. Needless to say, options are cheap. How do we take advantage of this, without going too unidirectional? Aside from long ICs, another potential winner is going long the VIX for June/July expiration. If the market continues soaring, the Long ICs win and the VIX Calls lose. If the market tanks (""corrects""), both win.

A bit puzzled as I do not remember opening said trade I said maybe it goes down and I cover the short position. 

Wrong Monday it opened up at $41 I covered the short for a $24600.. okay not great as I begin digging through my trade statements I notice a trade correction as well as a clear error as I did not have that many contracts in my account Friday let alone leave any open in the money.. 

What do I do? What can I do? Do I simply lose because I tried to manage risk and act responsibly by covering the shorted position? 

Does my broker now owe me my money and compensation? Do I hold any ground in this scenario? Can I demand compensation for their error? Like obviously I was distressed seeing i owed 22k while obviously I had the money for the initial shares I had to cover via margin which is a whole other issue.

prancers90,0.0,8.0,"If you overlay a PLUG and TSLA chart you will see they are very highly correlated... It's almost like they are the same stock.

However, PLUG IV is over 100 and TSLA is about 70.  Given the high correlation in stock price movement, my idea is taking advantage of the high IV in PLUG by selling puts and hedging by buying TSLA puts since the IV is lower.

Does this make a sense?  I typically only sell options so I'm not too familiar with trying an options strategy using 2 different securities, especially on the buy-side.

If what I proposed, taking advantage of inflated IV in a security that has another security with lower IV w/ high correlation, how would I structure the trade?

I'm assuming I'd pick the strike of the trade based on the same % from the current trading price.  So for example I'd pick let's say a 10% OTM puts for the 19 Feb for PLUG which is at 63 so the strike I'd use is $57.  The 19 Feb 57 puts last traded at .70.

Now for TSLA, it is trading at 816 and 10% OTM put would be the 735 strike which last traded at 3.06.

Now I'm assuming I'd sell the amount of contracts that would align the dollar amount together.  So if I sell the 57 strike and buy the 735 strike I need to figure out how many contracts to still buy and sell.  57 goes into 735 about 13 times.

So by going by dollar control, 13 contracts of PLUG need to be sold for every 1 TSLA contact.  

13x70=910 for PLUG 57 strike
 1x306=306 for TSLA 735 strike
910-306=604 credit.

Is this the right way of making a credit spread using 2 different securities with high correlation but 1 security has significantly higher IV?

johnnydangeloshow,0.0,8.0,"Anybody got any advice here? 

I have three PLTR calls at a $28 strike that expire in March. They cost $10.00 a pop. Breakeven is a $38 share price at expiration.

PLTR has been on a tear since it went public and I thought that it would make its way back to all time highs soon, especially with the announcement of partnerships and the upcoming earnings report.

But I'm worried about IV crush and theta. I did not plan on holding these calls for that long. I was thinking PLTR could ride the bullish momentum and get back to $45 soon then I would close my position and make around $2,500.

But now I'm wondering if I should stop out once the value of the contracts reach around $7.00. It would be a $900 loss. 

But at the same time, it's very probable that PLTR will be above a $38.00 share price at expiration.

thecheese27,0.0,6.0,"I just graduated last Fall with a degree in data science and analytics and if I am being quite honest, the world of working for some company, entering data, cleaning it, processing it and producing visualizations that guide the business towards future success sounds quite dry to me. I love math, numbers, statistics and the entire process of data analysis, however it all feels pointless when the end goal is to be one of a hundred pawns working at a business trying to make it make more money. 

I was spending my time lately contemplating what I really wanted to do with my life and I was counting down the days until I would force myself to look for a job and begin my life at a cubicle until I got introduced to the world of trading alongside the GME fiasco. That was about five weeks ago, and two weeks ago is when I discovered the world inside the world of stocks known as options and I am absolutely in love. Speaking strictly about the mechanics of how options work, (the different metrics, the greeks, the probabilities and research all mixed in with the added flare of an unpredictable and everchanging market), it might be the most fascinating concept I have ever come across. Add in the fact that I can actually make money doing something that I love and I think I may have found what I want to do with my life.

Now, my life story aside, I want to discuss the role data science and analytics plays inside the world of options. Trading options is quite simple in my mind. One observes different variables, greeks, market trends and anything else that they believe can help guide them on a decision to trade an option and then they ultimately decide whether or not to execute said trade. This all sounds to me like nothing more than a calculator. A processor that takes inputs via the form of price, delta, IV, theta, etc., and outputs a decision. Predictive analytics is a subfield of data science that involves building predictive models to, you guessed it, predict future outcomes. These models are constructed with an initial training dataset which gives the model data to build its algorithms and to give it the tools to be able to predict outcomes, and then a testing dataset is ran through the model to give an accuracy rating. The end result of the model would be to have as high of an accuracy rating as possible with the dependent variable being whether or not profit was realized. 

I am writing this thread because I am very curious if anyone here has any experience with data science/analytics and/or has a degree in said field because I personally think there is not a better major I could have studied to prepare me for options trading and I would love to hear if anyone else with a similar background has found success and attributes any of it to their background. I am also curious to know if anyone has considered the idea of building a predictive model that takes every input imaginable regarding an option's metrics and greeks and outputs what the best statistical play would be, be it a condor, strangle, covered call, strike date, assessed risk, probability of winning, etc., because to me it is the ultimate end goal for me and something that I want to be able to accomplish. I know something like this is impractical just through stocks because the market and movement is too random, but I am dying and praying to know if it is possible with options trading. 

Obviously it is not possible to get a model that works 100% or even 70% of the time, however constructing a model that has a 55 or 60% success ratio would be overwhelmingly validating. I have found articles about using predictive analytics and indicators to predict the movement of the market or an underlying stock itself, however the field does not seem to overlap much with options, more specifically option spreads, so I am optimistic that there may be some code to break. To be honest, even if there is ""proof"" that no such model exists, I would try anyways just because the journey just sounds fun lol. 

Any and all thoughts/feedback are welcome, hoping to learn and get as many opinions as I can.

Babayaga_711,0.0,8.0,"Okay, so I've been in options for a bit and finding a strike price normally is not an issue, as it is based on what I'm comfortable with in the time frame. 

Lately, I've been dabbling in day trading options on occassion (without going over my limit). For instance, after I saw the reaction to JPow's comments today, I went and bought puts on SPY. But I didn't really know what strike price (or premium, I guess) to aim for since my intention was to simply ride the negative wave and get out. 

I ended up buying 10 options for .08 each and an hour later, sold them at .21 each once the stock dropped 4 bucks, but I don't know if I would have done better with a different premium level or if it really doesn't matter since I had zero intention of holding the option past today where theta would kill it.

i-nose,0.0,7.0,"I’m fairly new to trading options, I got my feet wet with some good trades and some currently  underwater (their expiration date is far out so I’m not worried...at least for now ).

Yes, they have been low volume options, they were so cheap, it seemed like a good testing area. Now I’m starting to get into higher volume stocks, which cost me more money for the most part so hoping to learn more before I put more money out.     

Today was the first day I used market volume to dictate when to buy in and I did okay I think. Could do better, but still not bad. Anyways, I was looking at some of my options/stocks and I noticed more activity at opening and closing. Is this normal? I know now is not a normal market because of gme, but is it normal to see stocks come alive/make their biggest moves at opening and closing?

A Strategy to Overcome PDT Rules

@ Yeezy\_Trades

This is a strategy I have been using for some time that has allowed me to find success while stepping away from the news cycles and endless horde of “twittersultants” that have only helped me lose more than I could ever seem to gain. This will surely draw criticism and isn’t for everyone but if you feel like you’re chasing yourself in a circle trying to grow your account and you’re going nowhere then you might give it a serious look.

**What is the principle behind this strategy?** “Real traders try to hit singles, not home runs.” This is the easiest and most reliable way I’ve found to hit singles on a consistent basis.

**What is the goal?** To reach $25,000.00 as quickly and safely as possible.

**How does it work?** Using 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, and Hourly charts to track intra-day moves and identify a trending channel.

**What type of trades are you making?** Buying daily Call / Put Options based on short-term market momentum.

**What is a trending channel?** A trending channel is created when a particular stock bounces off intra-day trend lines created by daily highs and lows. These trends can present themselves as either horizontal or diagonal. While many believe these are psychologically created by traders and their emotions, I believe the culprit is algorithmic which is what makes this strategy more reliable than most.

Here is an example of trending channel that developed on $SPY on 9/25/2021 which I will use as an example throughout this post.

***SEE IMAGE 5 - Example Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/uftz6qjpj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f04c8415f2ed558768027f6e7152cdb25a2d1d04

This trade produced a return of around 80% after going as high as 110%. As you can see, I entered a little early, as I thought the downtrend was developing. I almost stepped out as my loss encroached on 10% however as the stock reached the developing trendline it turned downward and ran for a considerable amount of time. My stop loss eventually forced me out halfway down through the move, but I was incredibly happy with the profit I made.

As a disclaimer I would like to say that I had to go back and draw these lines in after the fact. The lines that I used to make my trade, created by Trend Spider, were much more defined and in line with the daily highs / lows. (I just do not remember exactly what they looked like at the time)

Now let’s talk about some of the restrictions and hazards of this strategy.

**Available Day Trades –** This is a day trading technique, and so you will need available day trades. This means that you will have a limited number of trade attempts per week. When I started with this strategy, I effectively could make three trades a week, typically M, W, F.  However, you could also use all 3 day trades on the same day or some variation in thereof, it is completely up to you and your trading style.

**FOMO – Fear of Missing Out.** I think this is probably an apparent risk to anyone who is familiar with trading, but it warrants some attention. Sometimes trends change, stocks alter their direction, they completely turn around and start moving the opposite direction. It is ok to lose 5%, 10%, even 15% if you’re willing to go that far. (My cutoff is 11%). Don’t get me wrong, it absolutely sucks to have 1 trade opportunity every 2 days and have to waste it on a loss but burning that trade and mitigating your losses is what will make you successful. Holding and watching a loss grow to 25%, 30%, 45%+ while you hope it turns around will blow up your account. I once read “If you are in a position where you are hoping your trade turns around, you’ve already lost” I agree, if you are in this situation then get out ASAP.

**Time Consuming –** Making 3 trades a day is painfully slow in the beginning, believe me I know. However, if you’re down several thousand dollars like I was and you are of the mindset “I have to claw my way back by any means necessary” then I highly suggest you try this. If you are looking for fast money and “extra-large tendies w/ fries on the side” then this probably isn’t for you.

**Trading deep in the Trend Channel –** These trends tend to be effective for a few hours at a time, but you must keep in mind they can change at any time. The more times that the stock bounces off a trend line the more likely it is that the next time it touches the trend line it will break out. A good rule of thumb is that if it is working on its 4th or 5th move against the trend line then it is likely to break out soon and setup a new trend, you should avoid taking a position at this point and look for a new trend to develop. Ideally, I try to enter a trade the 2nd or 3rd time it bounces off the trend line and hold until I am forced out by my stop loss or I am satisfied with my return.

Ok, so let’s talk a little more about the setup and entry point…

I tend to exclusively trade $SPY. I do this because I am very familiar with it and I have found that stocks are like people; they have a personality and once you get to know them you can moderately anticipate what they are likely to do next. However, like people, they will always find a way to surprise you so stay attentive. You can trade whatever stock you want just make sure you are familiar with it.

My search for a good entry point begins the moment I wake up. At this point I begin evaluating futures, foreign markets, pre-market moves and reviewing the Economic Calendar for the day. I am looking to see if there is anything that I can use to discern market momentum for the day.

This is important because to be successful you must trade with the market, meaning if the market is trending downward, you want to be buying Puts. If the market is trending upward, you guessed it, you want to be buying Calls.

Be very cautious on days that important market news is being released. Most recently this would be something like the Fed speaking on rate adjustments. However, it could be any number of things. Trading on days like this is fine just be sure you wait until after the news is disseminated. You want to trade on the confirmed news and momentum, not the on the speculation.

Once I feel that I am certain of the current market direction I begin looking at the Hourly chart and reviewing the trend lines provided by Trend Spider.

Ok so let’s go back and look at the trade I referenced earlier but a little more in depth.

***SEE IMAGE 1 - Hourly Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/jm2ikbiqj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af319f851baf7f0e4d381951f6ad88e4bf418659

This is the hourly chart; you can see where I’ve marked the open on 2/25. The daily news was indicative that markets were in a sell-off. Powell had the day before said no rate changes were coming but 30y bond yields were still on the rise. Investors were pulling out and there wasn’t any news on the horizon (that I knew of) that would change the market momentum.

I then went to my 15-minute chart to start plotting an entry point.

***SEE IMAGE 2 - 15 Minute Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/hx7jiw3rj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12c673984a899c5dd179bac5818a3ea912d0f58

As you can see, the market was already down considerably for the morning. Over 1.25 hours $SPY had given up 0.88% with no indication of stopping. The channel was comprised of two downward slopping trend lines I have drawn in on the 5-minute chart which can be found below.  (You can also see the entry and exit points I have marked for reference)

***SEE IMAGE 3 - 5 Minute Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/r24sprorj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d169fe7e87a987c77e68c55827794b86eedfcc

Here you can see the channel as it was developing, taken from the high and the low at the open candle and matched with what Trend Spider knew to be true at that point. (Again, I had to re-draw these lines, these are very close, but the trend lines produced by Trend Spider in real time are far more accurate.) I have also marked a notable point of interest with a red line. This was a strong indicator for me as it had previously served as support moments before but now as the price was working its way down the channel it was serving as resistance. I entered the trade a little early and almost stepped out as it seemed like it was about to break out of the channel but luckily it bounced off the resistance level a final time and continued downward.

Now to the one minute chart, this is where I keep my attention once I am in the trade.

You can see here it took off considerably. At this point I am glued to my desk (don’t tell my boss). I am constantly lowering my stop loss to lock in any profits. I think at the highest point it his 110% but I actually wound up taking around 80% profit out of it. Had I held a little longer I would have made double that, but hindsight is 20/20 and you should always lock in your profits. The worst thing you can do is be up big and end up at a loss because you got greedy.

Once I was out, I was done for the day, I moved on with my 8/5 job and waited until the next day when I had another expendable day trade.

Alright so that is about it. It is extremely simple, very easy to follow and does not require a lot of market knowledge, capital, or risk. The only thing you need is a lot of patience and an open day trade.

I am sure there will be a lot of criticism to the speed of this trading style but the idea is to stay in the green until you reach $25,000.00. This will work. Just be honest with yourself and do not be afraid to exit a position and burn a day trade once you see you’re at a loss.

A final thought. You’ll see a lot of traders talk about the size of their position. “I only risk 5 or 10% of my portfolio on any trade”. Typically, they are absolutely right but if you’re working from a very small dollar amount, anything under $500 as I was when I finally worked all this out then you’re going to have to be a little riskier and put a larger portion of your portfolio on the line to buy an option. This is ok but you MUST MUST MUST exit the trade if it starts going against you. And this might seem obvious, but I’ll say it anyways, do not enter a trade unless you have a day trade to spend. If you think “Oh I know which way it’s going, there’s only 30 minutes left in the market, I’ll hold it over night and sell it in the morning.” Just go ahead and Venmo me that money because it’s already gone. The overnight swing trades will absolutely decimate your account. It is gambling, this is trading.

One final final thing, I’ve created a new Twitter account, Yeezy\_Trades (Don’t judge me), just for the purpose of answering questions associated with this strategy and will be posting my thoughts on trending channels as they develop on $SPY. Feel free to follow me, message me, whatever you want to do. I will never ask for any money or compensation. I simply want to help people who have are having a difficult go of it and are looking for a way back into the market.

I would say best of luck, but this isn’t luck. It’s a proven system.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I would just read it really.  But the point is you can safely and consistently make large gains 2 / 3 times a week. These add up FAST, if you follow the system.

UPDATE TLDR: TrendSpider is what I use to draw the trend lines that create the channel, I do not draw them myself.

A Strategy to Overcome PDT Rules

@ Yeezy\_Trades

This is a strategy I have been using for some time that has allowed me to find success while stepping away from the news cycles and endless horde of “twittersultants” that have only helped me lose more than I could ever seem to gain. This will surely draw criticism and isn’t for everyone but if you feel like you’re chasing yourself in a circle trying to grow your account and you’re going nowhere then you might give it a serious look.

**What is the principle behind this strategy?** “Real traders try to hit singles, not home runs.” This is the easiest and most reliable way I’ve found to hit singles on a consistent basis.

**What is the goal?** To reach $25,000.00 as quickly and safely as possible.

**How does it work?** Using 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, and Hourly charts to track intra-day moves and identify a trending channel.

**What type of trades are you making?** Buying daily Call / Put Options based on short-term market momentum.

**What is a trending channel?** A trending channel is created when a particular stock bounces off intra-day trend lines created by daily highs and lows. These trends can present themselves as either horizontal or diagonal. While many believe these are psychologically created by traders and their emotions, I believe the culprit is algorithmic which is what makes this strategy more reliable than most.

Here is an example of trending channel that developed on $SPY on 9/25/2021 which I will use as an example throughout this post.

***SEE IMAGE 5 - Example Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/uftz6qjpj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f04c8415f2ed558768027f6e7152cdb25a2d1d04

This trade produced a return of around 80% after going as high as 110%. As you can see, I entered a little early, as I thought the downtrend was developing. I almost stepped out as my loss encroached on 10% however as the stock reached the developing trendline it turned downward and ran for a considerable amount of time. My stop loss eventually forced me out halfway down through the move, but I was incredibly happy with the profit I made.

As a disclaimer I would like to say that I had to go back and draw these lines in after the fact. The lines that I used to make my trade, created by Trend Spider, were much more defined and in line with the daily highs / lows. (I just do not remember exactly what they looked like at the time)

Now let’s talk about some of the restrictions and hazards of this strategy.

**Available Day Trades –** This is a day trading technique, and so you will need available day trades. This means that you will have a limited number of trade attempts per week. When I started with this strategy, I effectively could make three trades a week, typically M, W, F.  However, you could also use all 3 day trades on the same day or some variation in thereof, it is completely up to you and your trading style.

**FOMO – Fear of Missing Out.** I think this is probably an apparent risk to anyone who is familiar with trading, but it warrants some attention. Sometimes trends change, stocks alter their direction, they completely turn around and start moving the opposite direction. It is ok to lose 5%, 10%, even 15% if you’re willing to go that far. (My cutoff is 11%). Don’t get me wrong, it absolutely sucks to have 1 trade opportunity every 2 days and have to waste it on a loss but burning that trade and mitigating your losses is what will make you successful. Holding and watching a loss grow to 25%, 30%, 45%+ while you hope it turns around will blow up your account. I once read “If you are in a position where you are hoping your trade turns around, you’ve already lost” I agree, if you are in this situation then get out ASAP.

**Time Consuming –** Making 3 trades a day is painfully slow in the beginning, believe me I know. However, if you’re down several thousand dollars like I was and you are of the mindset “I have to claw my way back by any means necessary” then I highly suggest you try this. If you are looking for fast money and “extra-large tendies w/ fries on the side” then this probably isn’t for you.

**Trading deep in the Trend Channel –** These trends tend to be effective for a few hours at a time, but you must keep in mind they can change at any time. The more times that the stock bounces off a trend line the more likely it is that the next time it touches the trend line it will break out. A good rule of thumb is that if it is working on its 4th or 5th move against the trend line then it is likely to break out soon and setup a new trend, you should avoid taking a position at this point and look for a new trend to develop. Ideally, I try to enter a trade the 2nd or 3rd time it bounces off the trend line and hold until I am forced out by my stop loss or I am satisfied with my return.

Ok, so let’s talk a little more about the setup and entry point…

I tend to exclusively trade $SPY. I do this because I am very familiar with it and I have found that stocks are like people; they have a personality and once you get to know them you can moderately anticipate what they are likely to do next. However, like people, they will always find a way to surprise you so stay attentive. You can trade whatever stock you want just make sure you are familiar with it.

My search for a good entry point begins the moment I wake up. At this point I begin evaluating futures, foreign markets, pre-market moves and reviewing the Economic Calendar for the day. I am looking to see if there is anything that I can use to discern market momentum for the day.

This is important because to be successful you must trade with the market, meaning if the market is trending downward, you want to be buying Puts. If the market is trending upward, you guessed it, you want to be buying Calls.

Be very cautious on days that important market news is being released. Most recently this would be something like the Fed speaking on rate adjustments. However, it could be any number of things. Trading on days like this is fine just be sure you wait until after the news is disseminated. You want to trade on the confirmed news and momentum, not the on the speculation.

Once I feel that I am certain of the current market direction I begin looking at the Hourly chart and reviewing the trend lines provided by Trend Spider.

Ok so let’s go back and look at the trade I referenced earlier but a little more in depth.

***SEE IMAGE 1 - Hourly Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/jm2ikbiqj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af319f851baf7f0e4d381951f6ad88e4bf418659

This is the hourly chart; you can see where I’ve marked the open on 2/25. The daily news was indicative that markets were in a sell-off. Powell had the day before said no rate changes were coming but 30y bond yields were still on the rise. Investors were pulling out and there wasn’t any news on the horizon (that I knew of) that would change the market momentum.

I then went to my 15-minute chart to start plotting an entry point.

***SEE IMAGE 2 - 15 Minute Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/hx7jiw3rj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12c673984a899c5dd179bac5818a3ea912d0f58

As you can see, the market was already down considerably for the morning. Over 1.25 hours $SPY had given up 0.88% with no indication of stopping. The channel was comprised of two downward slopping trend lines I have drawn in on the 5-minute chart which can be found below.  (You can also see the entry and exit points I have marked for reference)

***SEE IMAGE 3 - 5 Minute Chart***

https://preview.redd.it/r24sprorj2k61.png?width=1567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d169fe7e87a987c77e68c55827794b86eedfcc

Here you can see the channel as it was developing, taken from the high and the low at the open candle and matched with what Trend Spider knew to be true at that point. (Again, I had to re-draw these lines, these are very close, but the trend lines produced by Trend Spider in real time are far more accurate.) I have also marked a notable point of interest with a red line. This was a strong indicator for me as it had previously served as support moments before but now as the price was working its way down the channel it was serving as resistance. I entered the trade a little early and almost stepped out as it seemed like it was about to break out of the channel but luckily it bounced off the resistance level a final time and continued downward.

Now to the one minute chart, this is where I keep my attention once I am in the trade.

***SEE IMAGE 4 - 1 Minute Chart***

I've been thinking about a trading strategy that seems to work a decent amount of the time, but there must be some caveat that I'm not seeing. I've been using an unusual options activity tracker (Market Chameleon), and every day I filter by tickers that have seen UOA with the lowest IV. Most of them are trusts, ETFs, and huge companies, but some mid and small companies show up which I tend to follow more closely. I set up a straddle for 45-60 days out and check the BEPs. Most of the time, the BEP is met within 2 weeks. My thought is when tickers experience UOA, it's either a lot of bets or whales hedging for a variety of reasons. I'm not sure which way they or I think the stock will move, but there are bets that it will move somewhere. By filtering by low IV, I lower the BEP and hopefully expose movements before they happen. 

In summary, I find tickers that haven't been moving much recently, but there are high volumes of options being traded currently. I take this as an indication that there will be a movement soon, and I set up a strategy that will benefit from any movement. My price will be lower in a relative sense due to low existing IV.

DanHodge,0.0,9.0,"Hi guys,

Thanks in advance for any info.

I have a CC CCIV strike of 40 expiring today, obviously massively in the money. I bought the underlying at $30 so I can't complain....apart from missing out on $2k of value. I have just noticed I can buy back the option for \~$2k ish at the moment, I sold it for \~$350 a week or so back. So is my math correct here:

**If I let the $40 contract expire today:**

Costs:

$3000 (Paid for underlying shares)

Return:

$350 (CC Premium) 

$4000 (strike sell price) 

Total Return: $4350 - $3000 = +$1350

**If I close to buy moving the strike out to $50 in April:**

Costs

$3000 (Paid for underlying shares)

$2000 (Buy back of the contract)

Return

$350 (Premium from 1st sale)

$5000 (Shares if stay above $50)

$2450 (Sale of $50 contract for April)

Total Return: $7800 - $5000 = +$2800

Or does the IV play less of a role when/if it gets above 10$ and I just wait it out to see a higher stock price?

awwwwwsocute,0.0,8.0,"So, I bought about $14,000 worth of SWI (solarwinds) hoping that it would bounce back after the hacking news settled down. Sounds like the company isn't going to recover from bad news cycle anytime soon.

I entered at average price of $18.48 and current price is $16.54. I have sold a few calls to recoup some of the cost considering price hasn't really been moving in last few months. I am (probably) collecting $700 as premium for the sold calls this week.

Since SWI has earnings coming up on Feb 25th, I expect the price to move big in either direction.  So, I am planning to buy about 5 $15P (03/19) (which is about $450) as an insurance policy.

Is there any better strategy for hedging in this case? For ROI, I am fine with anything above breakeven at this point, since this has been a significant portion of my portfolio.

So, It may be not a general rule, but TastyWorks usually send the possible outcomes for expiring options:

A few things to keep in mind regarding expiring options:

If you are long expiring option(s)...

Any long option that expires in the money by at least $0.01 will be automatically exercised. Any long option that does not expire in the money by at least $0.01 will not be automatically exercised.


If you are short expiring option(s)...

It is up to the long side to decide whether or not an option is exercised. This means:

If a short option expires at the money or out of the money, it is likely that it will not be assigned, but it is possible that it will be assigned.

If a short option expires in the money, it is likely that it will be assigned, but it is possible that it will not be assigned.


Exercise and/or Assignment May Result in Stock/ETF Positions

TastyWorks also remember :

If you do not have sufficient buying power to hold the stock position(s) that would result from exercise and/or assignment, our risk team may close your position(s) or take other measures to reduce or eliminate potential stock exposure.

 If the underlying will delivery dividend:

If your short calls are out-of-the-money, there is very little risk that you will be assigned early. If your short calls are in-the-money, early assignment is more likely right before the ex-dividend date.

IdonthaveCooties,0.0,9.0,"Hey everyone, hoping for some input

Bought 500 SNDL @ $1.14 and sold Feb 19th $1.5C's @ $0.15 premium, lowering my cost basis to $0.99, thinking that if I get assigned @ $1.5 I'd still make a good bit of profit.

With SNDL Currently at $2.15 at time of writing, my calls are obviously very ITM.

As I see it, I currently have 2 options:

1. Let them expire Friday and get called away, selling my 500 shares @ $1.5. This would net me $255 minus commission ( 500\*1.5)-(500\*0.99) but commission is $24.95 per assignment, bringing the total to $255 - (24.95\*5) = $130.25
2. I could Buy to close the options, currently worth $0.65, and then immediately sell the shares at market price. Math works out to (2.15\*500)-(0.65\*5) = $825, and after subtracting the $495 I paid for the shares after premium collected, I'd profit $330 **without** needing to pay assignment fees.

Am I missing something, or does it make way more sense to buy to close my deep ITM calls and then immediately sell the shares @ market price?

OnYourSide,0.0,7.0,"I had a $810 strike on some TSLA calls that were expiring today. Avg cost per contract was roughly 2.5 when RH closed out my 25 calls at 2:02pm when they were still pretty OTM.

Hello all new here been doing some DD and came across GSAT.  Made big gains recently and has an agreement with Qualcomm for new 5G chip technology late this week.  Volume has been high the later part of the week and stock has been trending up.
 I got into some SOS earlier this week after a tip but I have been looking ahead for the next thing.  This came across in my screener in finviz.  Calls for $2.5 are dirt cheap, seems like lots of potential here just wondering if anything else had this on their radar.  

Here is some of the news release

What happened
Shares of Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT), Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM), and Zomedica (NYSEMKT:ZOM) climbed 15%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, on Wednesday, as traders furthered their love affair with low-priced stocks.

So what
All three of these companies have had positive developments that have helped to spur sharp rallies in their share prices in recent weeks.

Globalstar announced on Tuesday that Qualcomm would include its Band n53 technology in the chipmaker's flagship 5G modem. Globalstar said the partnership would greatly expand the number of devices that could connect to its network.

*Notes on positions:*

I like keeping some cash in near-NAV SPACs ($LATN in this case), which function almost as high-yield savings accounts since they have limited downside ($10 floor; if this is news to you, google SPACs). Happy to deploy these funds when an opportunity arises.

**Updates:**

No short positions, so using a lot of my BP so far this week. 

Opened up a $IPOF debit spread w/ similar risk-reward as my $PSTH spread (risk $200 to make max $800). I’m betting $200 that Chamath’s announcement is both imminent and worthwhile; I think I’d take that bet any day of the week. Same deal with $IPOD (risk $216 to make a max $784) and similar deal with $FTOC (risk $184 to make a max $816, but no Chamath here).

Bought more $BFT calls, looks red enough an opportunity for me. Have the budget for one more during the next downtrend, otherwise selling at a small gain if it gaps up.

Decided to let go of $IPOE stock and some losers, and then bought nearer calls in hopes of getting Gamma Gang back on my side during the next uptrend.

**Plans:**

The greatest dings to my net liq have been due to my $IPOE concentration; similar to how I’ve been approaching $BFT, I think I might have to pursue a strategy of collecting profits at ~$24.25 and buying back at ~$23, and repeating, until the next catalyst. My previous plan was to just ride this naturally to $28 and endure the ups and downs, but I am changing these plans in favor of collecting profits more frequently.

I’m going to ride out all of my debit spreads unless they are at ~50% loss. 

Otherwise, more waiting. 

**Random Thoughts:**

Similar to how the Morey-/Harden-era Rockets lived and died by the 3, I currently live and die by the Chamath. I’m not too afraid of this sad $IPOE patch because I believe in [Charlamath tha God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlamagne_tha_God). Belief in a loud, celebrity spokesman is probably an ill-advised approach for any trader to take, but this fits in well with my strategy of pursuing hype stocks and staking my future in their hype men.

Boretsboris,0.0,7.0,"“Gamma squeeze” tends to be thrown around like a very bad pick-up line these days by everybody’s grandmas, uncles, and third cousins, once removed. Under my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/lzdroj/gamma_squeeze_indicator/gq2e0pp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) thread on a post in another sub, a random user shared a link to a write-up on dealer exposure to optionality and how it translates to the implied order book of the underlying.

Here is the link to the page: [https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The\_Implied\_Order\_Book.pdf](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf)  (Note: I am not affiliated with sqzme, and I am not promoting their services)

Give it a read.

I love how the author presents the dealer gamma exposure (GEX) as the implied order book. It really drives the point on how relevant dealer gamma is to the market’s liquidity.

What’s even more important is how the dealer vanna exposure (VEX) can overwhelm the dealer GEX. This is almost never discussed.

The author’s approach to explaining vanna can be improved to avoid unnecessary confusion. The “cheat sheet” provided needs to specify absolute delta for puts (or correct the effect of IV change on the put’s delta), because (for example) it states that a rise in IV decreases the delta of an ITM put. IV rise *increases* the (negative) delta of an ITM put by *reducing its magnitude*. Vanna is positive for an option with a strike above the spot, whether it’s a call or a put (whereas strikes below the spot have negative vanna). I’m also just not a fan of the distribution curves used to explain the concept. This is not how I conceptualize options, but if it helps others, then I’ll back off the bell curves — we can keep them.

To summarize the counterintuitive dealer VEX effect:

* Dealers start pouring liquidity into the underlying when their positive vanna turns negative on a downward move paired with a rise in IV (their negative vanna overwhelms their negative gamma).
* A chain-reaction crash happens when the dealers’ negative vanna turns positive and overwhelms their positive gamma on a downward move with a rise in IV.

This brings us to GME, everybody’s favorite ticker to squeeze. The covered call writers from r/thetagang may actually be contributing to the squeezes without realizing it. Look at the last squeeze on 24 Feb. If the dealers had a large inventory of long C60s, then a rally only had to bring GME just above 60 (flipping the dealers’ vanna from positive to negative) for WSB to get excited with FOMO once again and start buying OTM calls, raising the IV and starting the chain reaction upward.

Of course this is just speculation without actually knowing the dealers’ inventory, but I find it helpful to think about how we as retail traders may be contributing to the market’s liquidity by forcing the dealers to hedge our whims.",1,What’s Actually Squeezing?

This brings us to GME, everybody’s favorite ticker to squeeze. The covered call writers from r/thetagang may actually be contributing to the squeezes without realizing it. Look at the last squeeze on 24 Feb. If the dealers had a large inventory of long C60s, then a rally only had to bring GME just above 60 (flipping the dealers’ vanna from positive to negative) for WSB to get excited with FOMO once again and start buying OTM calls, raising the IV and starting the chain reaction upward.

Of course this is just speculation without actually knowing the dealers’ inventory, but I find it helpful to think about how we as retail traders may be contributing to the market’s liquidity by forcing the dealers to hedge our whims.",actually squeeze bipolar sister squeeze tends thrown around like bad pick line day everybody grandma uncle third cousin remove thread post another sub random user share link write dealer exposure optionality translates imply order book underlie link page affiliate sqzme promote service give read love author present dealer gamma exposure imply order book really drive point relevant dealer gamma market liquidity even important dealer vanna exposure overwhelm dealer gex almost never discuss author approach explain vanna improve avoid unnecessary confusion sheet provide need specify absolute delta put correct effect iv change put delta example state rise iv decrease delta itm put iv rise delta itm put magnitude vanna positive strike spot whether call put strike spot negative vanna also fan distribution curve use explain concept conceptualize help others back bell curve keep summarize counterintuitive dealer vex effect dealer start pour liquidity underlie positive vanna turn negative downward move pair rise iv negative vanna overwhelms negative gamma chain crash happens dealer negative vanna turn positive overwhelms positive gamma downward move rise iv brings u gme everybody favorite ticker squeeze cover call writer r may actually contribute squeeze without realize look last squeeze 24 feb dealer large inventory long c60s rally bring gme 60 dealer vanna positive negative wsb get excite fomo start buying otm call raise iv start chain reaction upward course speculation without actually know dealer inventory find helpful think retail trader may contribute market liquidity force dealer hedge whim,242
RSaka,0.0,7.0," 

I took a Credit Put Spread of 700-650 for 2 lots for a credit of around 2100. That was in the good days when TSLA was around 760. Now my net loss is around 6 k for this position. I am wondering if I should :

1. Ride thru to 19th and may be TSLA gets to above 700.
2. Close 1 lot early and get assigned to become proud owner of 100 shares of tsla at 700.
3. Close it all and buy a new spread for 450 , assuming this bond yield craziness continues into April.

Splooshkat,0.0,4.0,"Probably a silly question that I’m overlooking here. I typically stick with simple options like covered calls and cash covered puts. I’m lacking faith in the overall bull market this year, so I’m looking into other options that I might want to consider. Mostly keeping it basic. 

Looking at poor mans covered calls or diagonal spreads and needing a little bit of layman’s terms explanations of a few of the details. 

Mainly: why buy deep ITM calls as opposed to cheaper slightly OTM calls? I get that if the underlying goes up then with a higher delta your LEAP will gain value faster, but if you didn’t buy too far OTM then it shouldn’t take long for the delta on your LEAP to rise. Assuming your call is a year out that’s a lot of time. 

If the underlying goes down you’ll risk losing less of your investment if you bought OTM and your LEAP expires OTM anyway. 

As long as the CCs I sell are further OTM than my purchased LEAP I’m covered from major risk, leaving on only the cost of my LEAP as my potential loss? So why increase the cost of that potential loss?

Edit: I realize I was using some incorrect terminology writing this and that I wouldn’t actually be selling covered calls. Just wasn’t paying close attention.

**Call OI is much higher for April Futures and March Calls - A Short Term Outlook**

If you look at the Open Interest on Crude Futures options for April (expire the 17th of March), there are a load of calls that are expiring ITM, this large OI will trigger the buyback that I think OP in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/lt1tj4/oil_price_crash_anniversary_energy_squeeze_play/) is referring to. These options on futures expire on the 3/17th while calls on XOM and other oil expire the 3/19th.

[Crude April Futures Options](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CLJ21/options?moneyness=allRows)

[XOM March Options](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/XOM/options?moneynes)

Now, If you look at OI on XOM you'll already see quite a large OI in ITM calls, but with major interest at 55c which is only several dollars away. It's important to note that valuations for XOM and Crude index are tied closely. If crude goes up, XOM goes up. Since these futures options expire 2 days before options contracts. If crude squeezes as a result, it's going to accelerate the squeeze in XOM, especially at the 55c mark.

XOM has a announcement on wednesday although the nature is unknown it could have something to do with the sale of some of their old production assets which could increase price

**Upcoming Catalysts to watch**

* Key date is on the 4th of March when OPEC announces if they are going to continue at the same output or increase output with signs of global recovery in sight. If they do it would have to be a small amount (like under 500k or 1M extra) This will surely drive the price down however global oil consumption is still hard to predict since consumption is lower than forecasts so its really riding on vaccine distribution, reopening, and general spending to increase which means logistics sees a surge in fuel needs. It's unknown what the current crude reserves are in certain countries, the US is starting to exhaust strategic supplies but OPEC doesn't want to increase production if overall demand does return as quickly as expected.
   * Something to keep in mind, OPEC has to decide if they want to capitalize and raise oil prices at the cost of accelerating the switch to EV vehicles
* Another thing to note, when the Dollar Index goes down, crude goes up since every transaction is based on the USD. Since it looks like we're printing more USD this means crude prices will continue to rise, further feeding into a possible squeeze.
* Closing price of crude on 3/17 to see if futures fall in the money. Currently the larger OI contracts are in the money so a squeeze is probable. This will push all oil stocks up. XOM and Marathon have the strong correlation to Crude price movements and will be strongest with these two followed by Oxy and BP.

**As far as April Put movement:**

* This being said, the OI on puts could be ITM if Opec decides to increase supplies lower crude prices
* Valuations have been rising in anticipation for the meeting on the 4th. If a considerable raise in barrel output is announced for the month of April then we see a downward prices on crude and petroleum companies.

**Im rather bullish but again, the OPEC meeting on 4th is a big factor**

I am eyeing starters in high OI calls so liquidity isn't as much of an issue:

[XOM 3/19 55C and 60C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/XOM/options?moneynes) \- Huge OI compared to MRO

[OXY 3/19 30c and 35C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/OXY/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-03-19-m)

[BP 3/19 27.50C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BP/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-03-19-m) \- It should be noted that BP does not move as tightly with crude movement like ZOM and MRO but it certainly does move.

[UCO 3/19 60C](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/UCO/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-03-19-m) \- (high risk!) Proshares 2x Crude the daily movement (could be huge on the 17th/18th going into the 19th - Low liquidity (OI=287) but return could be excellent

**Hedging**

I may also pickup some XOM 3/19 50P starter as a hedge just in case ZOM's announcement is negative, but will still hold the calls mentioned above in the event crude surges.

**Inflation figures from stim**

Also another note, lower USD index values usually correlate to higher crude barrel pricing and with this 1.5T stim plan that was announce we may see another possible driver. It's hard to say since we have reopening outlooks at play as well.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Play is now valid for the short term. Long term calls 6+ months are now in the picture as well.

taintmoun,0.0,7.0,"Hello, 

so I havent completed DD for $U, or Unity software, but here is what I know. 

All I know is that 

1) $U is unreasonably sold off upon surprising earning (which is now more than often market reactions), but I think it also has to do with lock up expiration around mid-March. 

2) However, I believe the fundamental is strong in a way that it's opening a door for independent contractors and game makers in small to mid size to create opportunity. To me this is really appealing like what $AMZN or $EBAY when they opened the door for online shopping for anyone interested in selling. 

So I am considering to do some LEAP expiring either at the end of the year or next year, but what would be downside of it? Maybe not next week, as lock up expiration is approaching, but even the current price is almost, I believe, a steal, if not a fair price.

*Price upside: What are analysts saying about it and price targets?*  
[Analyst target price](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CNS/) is $79.50 which is higher than the current market price which is $66.11. So there’s price upside from an analyst perspective.

*Sentiment and news. Google, Twitter, Reddit. What are people saying? How do they feel?*  
Most February press looks positive for CNS. NASDAQ cited them as a solid growth stock. [Zach’s Equity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cohen-steers-cns-oversold-recover-133201761.html?.tsrc=rss) considers it oversold going into February.

*Earnings history. Have they consistently met earnings?*  
They’ve met their expectations on the last couple of earnings.

*Trend (200MA, 50MA)*  
Long-term trend is upward (past 5 years).  
Short-term trend is downward. Interestingly is the last 2 months was a downward  trend, and the two months prior to that have been an upward trend.

*Short selling. How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it?*  
Short ratio (aka days to cover) – 2.69  
Short interest – not much movement up or down in short interest.

*What is the put/call ratio? Are people betting against this stock to go down?*  
A few months ago, it was 9/10 Put/Call, making it very slightly bullish. A month later, it pulled more bullish to 7/10. But since then it’s pulled  back a bit to .75, so it’s still a bullish option market.

41 ETFs [hold CNS shares](http://link https://www.etfchannel.com/etfs/?symbol=CNS).

*Ichimoku*  
Price just dropped below the cloud. Conversion line also below the cloud. Upcoming bear cloud coming. That said, the lagging indicator hasn’t cleared below the cloud yet.

*My Thoughts*

Based on price upside, sentiment, and earnings trend, I feel bullish long term on CNS. Short interest remains pretty level which is a another bullish sign, along with a bullish put/call ratio. This quarter  included heavy buying by the institutions, and a large number of ETFs hold CNS shares.

However, from a short-term TA perspective, the stock appears to be in  a downward trend. How long this trend lasts is another thing. The next few trading days will tell if the stock will drop below the support on 1/29  (about 65.40), and if the Ichimoku lagging indicator will drop below the cloud.

smashjohn486,0.0,5.0," 

Today RH closed my spread automatically. I knew it was going to be close and passed up opportunities close it at a limited loss but felt, given support levels, it was better to let it ride.

It was a put spread $145/144. The stock (QCOM) closed at $144.94. They closed my spread for $0.63/contract at 2pm. This cost me over $2500.

By my calculation, I should have been out the difference between the closing price and the high side of the spread, or .06 per contract. This would have cost me $240. Opening the spread netted $740, so I actually should have positive $500 on the trade. Instead I’m out $2500

I’m sure RH is allowed to do this and I probably agreed to such terms when I opened my account.

I know I would have lost $4000 on the spread if it closed under $144, but I made a call and it was the right call, and yet RH cost me a lot of money.

Is this normal? How would other brokers handle this? Is it a problem to only have collateral equal to the difference in settlement cost? Any advice appreciated.

Fwiw: I emailed RH immediately when they closed the spread challenging the move. I emailed them again after closing bell with the cost difference.

Also, I posted this in the r/RobinHood sub and they immediately deleted it. I'm not trying to be inflammatory, just trying to learn more. I've recently opened a TastyWorks account and I'm wondering if this is standard broker behavior or not as it would influence how I invest in the future.",1,Is it Normal?

I have 1000 shares of ABC purchased at $20.

SnooGiraffes5436,0.0,6.0,"There has been a real lack of DD on this world leader within Microbiome, a SPAC that has gone largely under the radar with there been so many tech &amp; clean energy SPaCs within the last few months. So I wanted to do some proper, original DD and explain why I think this stock is significantly undervalued, some potential upcoming catalysts, and why I bought 4D Pharma (financial disclosure: holding 4,176 shares)

***Overview:***

4D Pharma (#DDDD) is a pharmaceutical company leading the development of a novel class of drugs derived from the microbiome (LBPs). 

4Ds core area of focus is oncology (study of tumours). But they also have advanced work in central nervous system, IBS, and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases.

4D Pharma's management team has wide range of experience at large pharma and bio companies ($BMY, $SGMO, $GSK, $TAK).

4D Pharma has partnerships with several large biopharma companies (Merck, Pfizer, Merck KGaA).

4D will be completing a merger with Longevity Acquisition Corp ($LOAC) (will be $LBPS post-merger) to be dual listed on Nasdaq &amp; LSE. 

***Pipeline:***

4D Pharma has a proprietary platform called MicroRx for discovery of treatments for a wide range of diseases. In 2 yrs, it has produced a pipeline of 12 potential therapies, &amp; is expected to deliver many more candidates. 4D Pharma is focused on immune-oncology.. Their leading oncology microbiome drug is MRx5018. What sets MRx5018 apart from all others is its applicability to numerous cancers and treatments and has KEY results due in 2021. 

MRx0518 is being evaluated in 4 different clinical trials in cancer patients.

\- Black small square Combination w/ #Keytruda® ($MRK) on solid tumors

\- Black small square Combination w/ #Bavencio® ($PFE) to begin in '21 on bladder cancer

\- Black small square Solid tumors – monotherapy

\- Black small square Pancreatic cancer

This is just one area that 4D is excelling but I believe will be the key driver. Any treatment of tumours which is found to show excellent results and could lead to FDA approval could see a parabolic rise from current SP.

***Competitors:***

4D has an estimated market cap around $200million. Extremely undervalued compared competitors in the field:

Seres Therapeautics $MCRB - $29.00 ($2.37b market cap)

Kaleido Biosciences $KLDO - $11.75 ($500m market cap)

Evelo Biosciences $EVLO - $18.50 ($900m market cap)

4D Pharma SP will rocket in the near future due to their diverse portfolio in comparison to competitors, excellent management team, robust partnership with world leading companies and extremely low cap in against competitors in the field 

***Catalysts for significant upside:***

\- NASDAQ - 4D Pharma with be completing a merger with Longevity Acquisition Corp ($LOAC) (will be $LBPS post merger). News on this Nasdaq listing is well overdue with the CEO stating the merger date will be received early Q1.. OVERDUE. We, like most spacs will likely see 50-100% increase in the short term due to increased US investment.

\- PIPELINE – We will see a parabolic rise within the next 12 months due to a successful treatment in the field of Oncology due to our incredible partnerships IMO.

\- TAKEOVER - It is well documented that Merck (MRK) who owns 5.8% In 4D Pharma have been ruthless in recent times with cutting partnership, however the relationship with 4D continues to be extremely strong and could quite easily result in a buyout within the next 12 months, just one of many companies which have shown strong interest in a 4D Pharma partnership.

\- SHORT SQUEEZE – Despite all of this, citadel still hold a short position on pharma company aiming to cure many diseases (personally I think should be illegal) but will quickly be burnt upon any news on Nasdaq or trial developments and spark a huge bull run.

**I repeat.. The merger between 4D Pharma (#DDDD) and Longevity Acquisition Corporation $LOAC is expected ‘early Q1’ as quoted by the director..**  **this is now overdue.. expect final DA and merger date Imminently.** 

THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE FOR THIS PRICE (4d just change their twitter to $LBPS coming soon). With clear excellent short- and long-term opportunities. Buy and enjoy.

I bought TSLA Leaps expiring in 2023

This is in my old man's IRA. Yes that's stupid as it sounds.  I am slowly moving my positions out of there as my dad is old and God forbid the short on my vertical debit spread gets exercised the wrong way, I'm out. I like to think I know all the risks of my trade here, but the nightmare scenerio here is above my risk tolerance and owuld wipe his retiremnt account. Basically I gave him post tax money as collateral in the idea I would pay less tax when he withdraws it in two years.

Started trading options around six months ago, seriously and full time. Just learning starting with paper and reading a lot. Settled on BUYING puts and calls. Nothing naked. Saw debit spreads as an easy way to get into some of the more expensive underlying.--trade

[https://imgur.com/a/UpV44US](https://imgur.com/a/UpV44US) I bought two 2023 TESLA dips

January when IV was dipped post earnings

And March, in retrospect stupidly when IV was high, pre earnings and paid a good bit of premium for them.

I bouhgt with the intention to hold until around a January 2022 earnings. Risk going in was only premium. No exercise risk as I would close by January 2022. Exercise risk on the short? I doubt it, they would give up a ton of extrinsic, so it doesn't make sense (at what $ value does it makes sense though is not soclear)?  Any other risks to consider on vertical debit spreads (I only do them on calls NOT puts, I plan on doing them on puts after practicing them on my paper account)?

**basically should i get out of this trade at a loss right now, as the underlying short being exercised could compromise a retiree age person's account** I made MGNI $$$ and so my dad's would be in the green by a couple hundred even with the loss on TSLA--trade  


I am also trying to calculate a worst case: So TSLA goes shoots up $200 past 1000 on a weekend, way before expiration, and drops harder  $400 by Monday. Someone exercised the short. since htis is before expiration, my long STILL has premium value. So my worst case is $600x100x2 contracts= $120k-premium on long I have to buy on margin, correct?

Lesson learned: Don't put shtit into your old man's IRA 1. 2: target an underlying that, if executed in that 1% chance, you can cover without margin if the underlying dips below your long leg.

I have today entered into some trades where I purchased 100 shares of some particular stock and sold ATM or almost ITM covered calls on those shares. 

Following are a few trades, prices after accounting for brokerage:

CCIV x 100 shares @ $3,123

$530 on $3,123 is 16.97% in 10 days

Short SNDL 1.5c FEB 19 @ $58.5

$58.5 on $298 is 19.63% in 10 days

Now I understand the following :
These are high volatility stocks now. 
I lose out on upside benefit above short call strike price. 
If stock prices drop then I am left bag holding but can sell covered calls in future to reduce my cost basis.
I understand I stand a chance to lose the shares incase the option holder exercises the option. Honestly if the option holder exercises an ATM option once I sell it, I would consider myself lucky that I realised the premium I wanted without the need for holding the shares and can chose to re-enter the same trade. 
My broker will sell my shares on expiry if the short calls are ITM.
I understand that these stocks could turn out to be multi baggers, but I am happy with even a 10% monthly return, its yet much better than what a VT can offer! 

On a separate note I understand that this will have tax implications for US citizens. I am not a US citizen and live in a country which does not tax capital gains in other countries. So tax isn't an issue.

My questions :
Am I missing out on an unseen risk?
Can I carry on doing this and probably make 10-15% monthly returns?

Honestly if the option holder exercises an ATM option once I sell it, I would consider myself lucky that I realised the premium I wanted without the need for holding the shares and can chose to re-enter the same trade. 
My broker will sell my shares on expiry if the short calls are ITM.
I understand that these stocks could turn out to be multi baggers, but I am happy with even a 10% monthly return, its yet much better than what a VT can offer! 

On a separate note I understand that this will have tax implications for US citizens. I am not a US citizen and live in a country which does not tax capital gains in other countries. So tax isn't an issue.

My questions :
Am I missing out on an unseen risk?
Can I carry on doing this and probably make 10-15% monthly returns?

The cost for a 4/16 $1.50 call was showing up as $0.01. I put in a few different bids and I was able to purchase at $0.50. 

I purchased a few contracts and for some reason my return on the call kept fluctuating between negative a few hundred dollars to positive a few hundred. I’m very confused on how the price is fluctuating so much. At close it stayed in the negative. 

Did I just make a huge mistake and throw away money? I thought I was getting a deal. Can someone explain to me what might be happening?

Also why a call for under the current value of the stock is so cheap?

Glurak,0.0,6.0,"I just realized I might have missed a lot when buying stocks. Or have I overlooked some obvious drawbacks?

Let's say I want to buy 100 shares of the stock. But I instead write deep in the money put on it, collect premium and then, at the expiration date, I get assigned and finally buy the stock. At the strike price, which is equal to original stock price plus original intrinsic value of premium. But I received the premium at the beginning, thus it's like buying at the original cost MINUS original extrinsic value of premium.

Pluses: I get discount on the stock. I effectively borrow the premium until expiration date without paying borrow fees, actually, I get paid for it instead. If the stock sunks, exiting option position is a bit cheaper then selling the stock itself.

Neutral: If the stock shoots up too much, the put will expire. But I will at least keep the premium (minus tax). If I get assigned, I can deduct the premium cost from the cost of the stock and avoid tax on it. Technically, I can still write OTM calls covered by this put.

Negative: I won't collect dividends and I will technically start owning the stock later (for calculating when it will become tax free). I can ""buy"" only in multiplies of 100.

Hi All,Need some help with the education on TDA. I have attached three screen shots of questions I got right but that is because I worked backwards. My understanding on Short Calls is that it is a bearish option. For example: Strike of $50, Premium of $2, Call Sold at $48, Expires at $49 therefore you get to keep the $2 premium (x100) and it expires worthless.

Photo One explains this not being the case: Strike of $98, Premium of $5.20, expired at $110, and stock price when call was sold was $98.12.

1. Why would one sell this call when the price already exceeds the strike?
2. The 'correct' answer is a gain of $520 but since it hit and exceeded the strike at expiration wouldn't this be a loss?

Photo Two: Strike of $20, Premium of $1.33, expired at $22.44, and stock price when call was sold was $19.44.

1. I understand why you would want to sell this call when the stock price is lower than the strike.
2. It expired $2.44 over the strike thus eating away at the premium of $1.33 (x100) but the correct answer shows this to be profitable, why?! These numbers in my opinion would suggest a loss and how can one make more than the premium? This is a short call where profits are max at the premium but losses are unlimited (for the most part)

tl;dr: I use deep ITM to make low risk gambles that a stock will do a quick spike as soon as earnings are announced and fall enough that I can get back in below that asking amount. Because I like chaos. It's dumb, even though I've profited. 

This is something I do from time to time risking a small part of my portfolio, and seriously, it's dumb. I love watching stocks react to earnings. I really enjoy it with lower priced stocks. It's not uncommon for a stock price to spike big time, then everyone's sell orders trigger and it's back to where it started. This happens within a few minutes or even seconds. 

At one point, I'd wait for Benzinga to announce earnings and would scalp. Then, about a year ago, I had this dumb idea. Here it is:

 1. Buy shares of something with afternoon earnings. Thursday ones are great for this. 

 2. Buy DEEP ITM puts with the shortest DTE you can get. Watch the underlying fluctuate a bit during the day. Sometimes you can buy shares and wait a few minutes and buy puts and have 0 risk. 

 3. Wait for earnings. If the stock pops, take profits. When it settles a bit, buy those shares back. You can sometimes do this two or three times. 

 4. Know you can exercise if needed. 

Your downside could be small or $0 or guaranteed profit. You limit upside. 

No spike? You're out your premium. 

Spike and sell too soon? You've limited upside but you are ahead. 

Let's say you sell and it keeps rocketing. You can still buy and exercise. 

If it goes over your strike price... That won't be fun. 

Hypothetical:

XYZ $10/share. Buy. Buy XYZ $30 puts for $20.50. 

You are down $50 per 100/shares. 

Earnings happens, XYZ does a quick spike to $11.50. Sell. That was just people excited to hear the word ""beats."" Stock heads back down to $10.30. Buy. Maybe do it again. 

10.50 to $11.50 = $100 Buy back at $10.50 and you can exercise. 

If it plummets, you're out the premium. 

If it only goes up, you're out the premium...but maybe make up for it with the underlying. 

Small Cap Example: $SKT

This was not as profitable as I hoped it would be, but it was still a quick $1000ish. I bought the options first after watching the prices and seeing nice contracts popping up. The underlying was near $14.25. 

I bought 4x $16P @ $1.94 4x $18P @ $3.85 6x $23P @ $8.95

I ended up buying 1400 shares at $14.30. That's 400/ @ $16.26 400 @ $18.10 600 @ $23.20

I'm down $260ish. 

I sold my shares at an average of approximately $15.65 (after mistiming the top and buying back in). 

I bought back in at $14.85 about 40 minutes later and ultimately exercised. 

For those wondering why I didn't just sell the puts, the spreads made that pointless. 

I did the cycle twice with $ABNB. I would have been better off just going long the stock, but that's hindsight. $FSLY was a good one, too. In that case, I did sell the puts rather than buy the shares back. 

I have been successful about 80% of the time using this, but profits are sometimes small.

tl;dr: I use deep ITM to make low risk gambles that a stock will do a quick spike as soon as earnings are announced and fall enough that I can get back in below that asking amount. Because I like chaos. It's dumb, even though I've profited. 

This is something I do from time to time risking a small part of my portfolio, and seriously, it's dumb. I love watching stocks react to earnings. I really enjoy it with lower priced stocks. It's not uncommon for a stock price to spike big time, then everyone's sell orders trigger and it's back to where it started. This happens within a few minutes or even seconds.

1. I own an underlying security (100 shares).
2. I “sell to open” a covered call option with OTM strike price (for ex: $5) (will collect less premium, I understand this)

Scenario 1:
1. If the stock price (for ex: $3, at the time of selling the covered call) is below or at the strike price on expiration, I as a seller have to do nothing. The option will expire worthless and I keep the premium. Do I need to close this transaction somehow?

Scenario 2:
1. If the stock price goes above the strike price before or by expiration. The option can be exercised anytime by the buyer. This is called “assignment”. I will have to sell the 100 stocks at the strike price. Do I exclusively need to sell them or the brokerage will handle this. How do I close this transaction?

2.  When can I “Buy to close”?  Is it saying, I am buying back this option at its current premium price from the original buyer of my option?

EvilNedFlanders,0.0,7.0,"Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to options trading and have a question about puts I'm hoping to get answered.  I've googled and watched numerous videos but none of the sites or videos I see/watch, address my question.  Here is my example/question:

Say Microsoft is trading at $140/share and I'm bearish on it, and buy a put with a strike price of $120 for $2,000 premium, with an expiration in one week.  

On the day of expiration, say at 11 AM, Microsoft is now trading at $80/share.  I now see that I can sell my put option for a $3,000 premium, netting me $1,000 profit (paid $2,000, selling for $3,000).

This is the part I get hung up on.. wouldn't I be able to exercise the put at $120/share for $12,000 total (which essentially means I'm shorting the stock until I buy back 100 shares).  Then, immediately after, purchase 100 shares at the current price of $80/share for $8,000 total.  

That would net me $4,000 minus the $2,000 premium I paid for the put, for a total profit of $2,000.

currently holding 500 shares of AGTC stock, bought at 6.70 per share. AGTC is currently trading at 5.08 at market close so im making a loss of ard 700 usd.

I currently own 125 shares of MSFT (avg 179$)

STO 3 MSFT Apr 1, 2021 247.5 Calls @2.69 ($810 premium)
(I guess 1 covered and 2 naked calls, I am in a margin account) 

Since Microsoft is not a volatile stock, i dont expect any surprises that it would be up big in 1 day which gives me time to react.

Not planning on letting it get too close to strike either and will roll when needed.

The delta is around .25 based on the options profit calc so even if I BTC to roll at 245 up and away, I am still on the profit because of the gains of 125 shares no? If I understand correctly, for every dollar it goes up am losing around 75$/share in my contract but I am gaining 125$/share on the shares I am holding.",1,Need Opinions: Combination of a Covered and Naked Call,5.0,1.0,"Need Opinions: Combination of a Covered and Naked Call I already asked this on another platform with some answers (Just do covered calls and dont do naked).

I currently own 125 shares of MSFT (avg 179$)

STO 3 MSFT Apr 1, 2021 247.5 Calls @2.69 ($810 premium)
(I guess 1 covered and 2 naked calls, I am in a margin account) 

Since Microsoft is not a volatile stock, i dont expect any surprises that it would be up big in 1 day which gives me time to react.

Not planning on letting it get too close to strike either and will roll when needed.

The delta is around .25 based on the options profit calc so even if I BTC to roll at 245 up and away, I am still on the profit because of the gains of 125 shares no? If I understand correctly, for every dollar it goes up am losing around 75$/share in my contract but I am gaining 125$/share on the shares I am holding.",need opinion combination cover naked call already ask another platform answer cover call dont naked wanna know wanna add naked call wanna get opinion ever want take risk would bad play currently 125 share msft 179 sto 3 msft apr 1 2021 247 call premium guess 1 cover 2 naked call margin account since microsoft volatile dont expect surprise would big 1 day give time react planning let get close strike either roll need delta around base profit calc even btc roll 245 away still profit gain 125 share understand correctly every dollar go lose around 75 contract gain 125 share hold,104

2) Burry has been schitzposting on twitter about hyperinflation. He posted this: https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859

cai24,0.0,5.0,"I am new to writing covered calls and have primarily done weeklies (one week out). I usually open them on Friday morning/afternoon.

adrian-beckster,0.0,3.0,"This is my attempt at understanding covered calls. Not really a question, more just trying to break down the strategy and understand how it fully works. 

You’re holding 100 shares of XYZ long term. You’re content  with holding long term, but you’d be alright with selling it off sooner  for a potential profit. Because of this, you write some covered call  options to collect the premiums, and hey, if the stock goes above the  strike price, cool, you collect the premium, take a bit of profit, sell  your 100 shares, and you’re happy.

However,  if the stock falls below the strike, you’re cool with still holding  onto the stock, cause you’re in it for the long term. You collect the  premium, the value of your stock goes down, but you’re still holding,  and can still use the underlying for future covered call plays.

If  your playing with underlying assets that you’re willing to hold long  term, the up and down price fluctuations of the underlying don’t matter,  because holding the stock is more important than the stocks current  value (given a long play)

Now, as  the stock goes down the premiums you can collect will be lower, but as  the stock price goes up, you run the risk of assigning the option and  selling your 100 shares. To me, if you’re selling covered calls, you’ve  already come to terms with selling the stock.

TLDR:  if you wanna make some money holding stock, use covered calls to  collect the premiums, but be okay with the risk of selling the 100  shares you own.

Cliffe_Notes,0.0,6.0," 

As I'm sure most of you know, talks of inflation and increased rates are circulating the news and subreddits. Also, Jerome Powell (our boy JPOW big boy money printer) talked to the Senate today.   


Here are the most common indicators for Stock Market Crashes. 

**Rampant Speculation of Stocks**

This is seen everywhere, in our current market: SPAC’s being the main culprit. But also things like AMC and GME, Crypto currencies. 

**Rampant Speculation effect on the economy:** Prices go up! And this causes a Bubble. 

(yea its dumbed down)

**Slowing Growth Rates of Economy:** 

Inflation: Do I really need to explain how there is stupid amounts of inflation happening

GDP: The GDP still hasn’t reached its previous level of COVID-19

Unemployment: Total Unemployment is 6.3%, Women 6%, black or African American 9%, bottom 25% of wealth is 25% unemployed.

**Peak Valuations:** P/E ratios are through the roof on every single stock compared to historic terms.

**Lower Interest Rates:**

Interest rates are pretty much 0% right now. 

**Potential Catalysts of an Entire Crash of the Market:**  
Its staring us in the face: **Rise of Interest rates**

Why would this cause the crash. Well go do your DD if you don’t understand why. Or go look look at the SPY max, and when the interest rates go up and Compare them.   


**Effect JPOW had today:** 

JPOW, stood by his guns and said that the interest rates will not increase for the near future. Even with the future rises of inflation, due to the base standard and the increase in demand from the opening up post covid.  
He also said something interesting and insightful of when we will see Interest rates rise. When Unemployment goes down. Some background information is that before COVID the Fed was constantly talking about how minorities and lower wealth people were adding to the recovery of the Economic state of the US.   
I personally don’t think JPOW is going to hike interest rates until the unemployment.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Strategy:** 

I think there is going to be a major pull back 10% or so in the economy when people see heightened inflation rates this April or May. I have SPY puts expiring JUNE.

Going to monitor Unemployment rates and Interest rates closely. When the lower quartile of wealth unemployment decreases to near average or Total unemployment rates, I will probably enter bear mode, and buy PUTs on the majority of the market. Probably heavy puts on the DIA and XLK.   
DIA because they have the cheapest ones, and XLK because I think tech will plummet for sell offs since their valuations are the highest.

**Positions:** 

XLK Puts expiring June 18th

SPY Puts expiring June 18th

Moderate amount DIA Puts expiring Jan 2022 

\^

Will times 4 what I have in there.   


When Unemployment settles back towards the average. I will be buying PUTS' one to two years out, on our tech etf's and DIA.",1,"Bear Manifestation 2021 or 2022, maybe 2023?",6.0,0.72,"Bear Manifestation 2021 or 2022, maybe 2023?

**Peak Valuations:** P/E ratios are through the roof on every single stock compared to historic terms.

**Lower Interest Rates:**

Interest rates are pretty much 0% right now. 

**Potential Catalysts of an Entire Crash of the Market:**  
Its staring us in the face: **Rise of Interest rates**

Why would this cause the crash. Well go do your DD if you don’t understand why. Or go look look at the SPY max, and when the interest rates go up and Compare them.   


**Effect JPOW had today:** 

JPOW, stood by his guns and said that the interest rates will not increase for the near future. Even with the future rises of inflation, due to the base standard and the increase in demand from the opening up post covid.  
He also said something interesting and insightful of when we will see Interest rates rise. When Unemployment goes down. Some background information is that before COVID the Fed was constantly talking about how minorities and lower wealth people were adding to the recovery of the Economic state of the US.   
I personally don’t think JPOW is going to hike interest rates until the unemployment.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Strategy:** 

I think there is going to be a major pull back 10% or so in the economy when people see heightened inflation rates this April or May. I have SPY puts expiring JUNE.

Going to monitor Unemployment rates and Interest rates closely. When the lower quartile of wealth unemployment decreases to near average or Total unemployment rates, I will probably enter bear mode, and buy PUTs on the majority of the market. Probably heavy puts on the DIA and XLK.   
DIA because they have the cheapest ones, and XLK because I think tech will plummet for sell offs since their valuations are the highest.

**Positions:** 

XLK Puts expiring June 18th

SPY Puts expiring June 18th

Moderate amount DIA Puts expiring Jan 2022 

\^

Will times 4 what I have in there.   


When Unemployment settles back towards the average.

MY THOUGHTS

There's general price upside here, whether it's a smaller target (8.42) or a larger target (12.14). It's promising that SOLO is expanding their retail presence in the US by 100% (from 10 sites to 20 by the end of June). Long-term 200MA is trending upwards, and the put/call ratio is bullish. However, it's not comforting to see a smaller institutional and ETF footprint here.

Looking more closely at the TA, I'm feeling near-bearish. Ichimoku is signaling a possible downturn. The last month or so could be the beginning of an upward short-term channel, but I think the next couple of days will tell if the price will drop below BB and also reinforce the Ichimoku signal. Some folks have pointed out that December through now could be a bull flag, but ehhhhh I don't know. It looks more like consolidation.

Disclosure: I have no open positions on SOLO as of this writing.

And then selling cash secured puts on TSLA probably monthly puts slightly out of the money.  Looks like the monthly $10 out the money are going for 5k premium. If I get assigned I'd be cool with having 100 shares of tesla at 780 that j could hopefully wheel calls at 790 for the next month for another 5k.  

Obviously I could get assigned at 780 and the price can go to 650 or I could sell 100 shares at 790 and the price could go up to 900. I THINK TSLA will trade side ways for a little while.   I'll probably wheel weeklys for other stocks while waiting for the right price for TSLA. (Also gonna look for some monthly dividend stocks to wheel where I'll get the dividend while holding the shares.  

So I know this is r/options. Wondering if anyone has had success just using the wheel for monthly income (or just portfolio appreciation.)  I know the risks. I (could) have the capital. I just need advice, or someone to either encourage me, or talk me out of it. And if it's a good idea.

* **Fastly stock price movement:** Down to $80, from $110-$115 last week.

**What does Fastly do?**

Fastly is in the Internet Infrastructure industry, and is first and foremost built with developers in mind, and their winning approach has quickly given them important market share over the last few years. They are a global Content Delivery Network (CDN). They have built a better approach at speeding up the internet based on location of data centers, but also through optimized hardware and enhanced security protocols. CDN and Fastly’s offerings are increasingly vital in the cloud era, as speed and security matters.

To put things in perspective, they have 2020 annual revenues of roughly $291 million, versus a total addressable market that Fastly sees as being $35 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recent acquisitions:**

They have acquired Signal Sciences for $775M in cash and stock, back in H2 2020. This acquisition is a strategic one to expand Fastly’s security portfolio.

* **Signal Sciences:** Directly from Fastly’s press conference: “The transaction combines Signal Sciences’ powerful web application and API security solutions with Fastly’s edge cloud platform and existing security offerings to form a unified suite of modern security tools. This robust new security portfolio, designed for the way developers work, unlocks innovation at the edge and removes silos between developers, operations, and security teams to shorten development cycles and protect websites and web applications alike.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Straight from February 17th earnings call:**

**Q4 2020:** 

* Revenues of $83 million (net of $2 million deferred revenue writedown), which represents a 40% YoY growth.
   * **Estimates were at a growth of $82 million, so slightly beat expectations**
* Gross margin of 59.2%, up from 56.7% in the same quarter last rear.
   * Non-GAAP gross margin (excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets) is 63.7%, up from 57.6% in the same quarter last year
* Cash position of $216 million (blend of cash, restricted cash and investments)
   * They used approximately $200 million cash to acquire Signal Sciences earlier in the year, a non-recurring item that had a significant impact on cash position. Despite that, they are cash-rich, which gives them a strong ability to further invest in growth
* Net retention rate of 115%, which is pretty phenomenal. This means that net revenue from existing customers increased by 15%
* Customer growth: 37 new customers to content delivery (1.81% - Not fantastic), and 11 new enterprise customers (3.51% - enterprise clients are the highest-spending category of clients) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Annual:**

* Revenues of $291 million, which represents a 45% YoY growth
* Gross margin of 58.7%, up from 55.9% for 2019
   * Non-GAAP gross margin is 60.9%, up from 56.6% for 2019

&amp;#x200B;

**2021 Outlook:**

* For Q1 2021, they expect revenues in the range of $83 million to $86 million, non-GAAP losses ranging from $14 million to $10 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share ranging from $0.13 to $0.9
* For the full year 2021, they expect revenues in the range of $375 million to $385 million (28.87% to 32.30% growth), non-GAAP losses ranging from $50 million to $40 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share ranging from $0.44 to $0.35

Margin-wise, we can see an improvement not only for the year, but also for the latest quarter. They are tracking in the right direction, especially considering the quarterly growth is higher than the yearly growth (non-GAAP growth of 10.59% for the quarter, versus 7.60% for the year)

&amp;#x200B;

**What now?**

Sure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young-ish, and still in growth mode. That being said, if growth begins to slow, we should expect them to slowly transition into a profitable company. Margins are improving, so hopefully this will happen over the next few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the risks?**

* Back in October 2020 Fastly dropped by about 25% on announcement that they were getting a reduction in business from its largest customer, TikTok (about 12% of revenues back then). So that projected loss of revenue from this specific client is already priced in. As a result, they had a decreased revenue guidance of 3.5% to 8.0%. Considering the stock had been on a meteoric rise (about 580% growth YoY prior to that October 2020 announcement), I think a 25% pullback was entirely natural.
* What happened on Friday, February 19 2021 is related to this; when Fastly made that announcement and the stock dropped by 25%, a bunch of vulture law firms started class action lawsuits against Fastly for failing to disclose it properly, as any law firm lacking self respect would do. The investigation has now been initiated. What are the potential consequences of this, I have no clue. Hence why it’s a risk. 
   * I’m not personally too worried about this, because class action lawsuits against companies always happen the moment a share drops significantly (it recently happened with Slack when they issued guidance that was less than what analysts expected, and this didn’t stop Salesforce from buying them). Also, personally my play is a short-term one of two months, and I do not see too much of a short-term impact from this. See the press release [here](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/fastly-investigation-initiated-former-louisiana-035000107.html).
* It’s a competitive market, so if you are in this for the long run, you need to keep track of Fastly’s continued ability to innovate, to win new clients, and to have strong retention rate (which right now is at 115%). Margins are improving, but pricing battles could eat into them
* As growth slows, it's obviously important to monitor for a transition to profitability. If you see slowing growth, and stagnant margins, then it would be cause for concerns

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Fast growing company, has not disappointed in terms of results. While we cannot expect the same kind of growth, this is not a growth play for me - Rather, I see this as a play on what I believe is an extreme market reaction to a slightly lower growth guidance than expected, combined with the TikTok-related lawsuit. This is not a long call kind of play for me, but more of a bull spread to minimize my cost of entry in case the market disagrees with me for too long.

EnPaceRequiescat,0.0,6.0,"Hi everyone, I've been studying a lot of posts on options, including this subreddit. Apologies if this has been asked before, I may have missed posts.

The goal is to try to get more leverage on short term price movements, to take advantage of less capital (e.g. when Palantir was oversold this past week), and I'm trying to figure out if I should be using ITM/OTM, and timeframe (i.e. 1/3/9/12 months out). Another application, for example, is if I think the price has bottomed out for the time being and a short term trend is coming up (i.e. a run-up to an earnings call or a drug approval).

Things that I think I need to be wary of/keep in mind:

- theta decay: either use deep ITM calls, or if trying to use OTM calls to get more leverage/$ spent (calculated roughly as delta*price of stock/call price), be very sure that it's a short term move. Also, in case the price did not move in my favor in a short enough time span, hopefully I did not lose too much to theta.

- IV crush: again, hopefully ITM calls can minimize the % spent on the premium, or if using OTM calls check that the IV is steady

- bid-ask spreads: focus on stocks with high volume and narrower spreads, judged as % of premium

- it seems to me like ATM calls are not a good idea, as either way the underlying moves, the extrinsic value/share drops.  Where as ITM calls have lower extrinsic value and so this doesn't matter as much, whereas for OTM calls price movement in your favor should actually increase the extrinsic value/share, and price movement and losses are actually deleveraged (due to gamma).

- related, it seems like maybe the most bang for the buck might come from buying OTM options at roughly the price I think the stock will appreciate to (so, not too far OTM). This way, I get the most rapid delta increase, and the most gain in extrinsic value/share. 

Any risks and factors that I'm missing? Is there a better way?

My IBKR portfolio looks like this:

1 SNDL CC Sold 19/02 $4
1 SNDL CC Sold 19/02 $3.50

Each of the CCIV calls are now of course massively in the money and will get called away. The PLTR, SNDL will expire by the looks of it and the APHA are 50/50. 

So I just got an email saying my margin requirements were too low and my 100 PLTR shares have been sold. What I don't get is how this is possible, the CCIV options in my account are showing as -1700ish each which looks like it's going against my available margin but I don't get why. I don't care if those CC's are -100000 because when they expire ITM my shares will just get called away. What am I missing? It feels like I am missing something stupid here!

Splooshkat,0.0,5.0,"I've lurked for a while, but this is my first time posting. I don't dabble in options a great deal, but I do make some low risk options trades. I have an retirement account only approved for covered calls in which I've got several positions on which I'm very long (basically value investing). 

I'm trying to keep track of options trades so that I can compare some (very) basic information about each one. My question is regarding how people organize their options journals (and I may have trouble wording it coherently, bear with me please).

Do you organize your journal so that profits are shown as soon as you open a position, or do you organize your journal for each position to be opened and then closed before profits?

For example: Monday I sell to open call for $500 after commissions and fees. Wednesday I buy to close for $100 including commissions and fees. Then I sell to open another call for $300.

Do most of you consider this:

A) $500 profit on Monday, and then another $200 profit on Wednesday? Or 

B) consider it a $400 profit Wednesday and you won't record your profit until you close the new position?

I do realize that you'll need to consider the open and close prices in order to really evaluate your trades (Option B). On the flip side it seems like you would need to account for profits by method A for some tax instances (at least in not a tax deferred account).

I know some things are just personal preference, but I've noticed that in most spreadsheet templates or journal programs I've checked out they typically use option B so I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't overlooking something very basic (other than the whole data is more useable this way thing).",1,Preferred Method of Journaling Covered Calls,5.0,0.86,"Preferred Method of Journaling Covered Calls I've lurked for a while, but this is my first time posting.

I purchased a covered call on a security, then when it shot up a little, I rolled it up and out a month to capture more premium.  So I lost on the buy-back of the initial call, but not a lot.

The second call just expired worthless.  The security is now a bit under water, but overall with the options expiration last week, I have a somewhat healthy profit.

While I have interest in the underlying security, I also have other places I'd like to employ those funds.

With options out to December 2021 only $400 at price and the stock itself being relatively cheap I think its a great low risk investment idea if you believe in Daddy Coin but I'm interested to hear your thoughts.",xnet likely breakout candidate news blockchains skyrocket coin daddy hit 50k recently riot mara get attention xnet kind still sit around riot long ago sit around 5 dollar make similar run xnet currently 92 month flatlined past day draw trendlines look technical perspective appear show real breakout potential december 2021 price relatively cheap think great low risk investment idea believe daddy coin interested hear thought,67
mrwhooper,0.0,6.0,"I was thinking about a scenario for covered calls in situations where there is high volatility and a sharp fall in the stock market, like in March 2020 for example. 

So if you had covered call in this case, you would earn the premium for the short call, but for the long stock, you would lose money. In addition, the premium earned would be less than the profit gained on the long stock, causing a net loss. This is due to the sharp and significant decline of the stock. 

Is my assumption above correct? 

If so, what kind of strategies could one make to mitigate this kind of scenario and minimize loss?

Westmoth,0.0,6.0,"Hello, quick question that I have which I am sure is very simply but I am having some difficulty with it.

Lets say XYZ is 100$ a share. If I write a $90 strike put for 5 days out expiration and purchase a $88 strike put for insurance, what happens if XYZ closes out at $89 at my spreads expiration? 

The reason I am confused is because if XYZ expires in the middle of my strikes, then I would be assigned to put the cash down for the put I wrote, but I would not be able to exercise the 88$ put since XYZ closed at $89.

Does this mean I would need the margin or cash on hand in case this happens? I know if XYZ closes at $85 for example I can exercise my put option and the max loss would be the difference of the long and short put - credit received x 100.

raptors902,0.0,5.0,"For those of you who aren’t familiar with this situation I will outline a brief summary here. On Dec 16th, it was announced APHA would acquire TLRY through a reverse merger, with the new company trading under the TLRY name. Through this merger, each share of APHA will be converted to 0.8381 shares of the new TLRY ticker. However, there is currently a price dislocation in the market, as APHA closed Friday at 16.94 compared to 29.00 for TLRY. This represents a 30% discount from fair value on APHA.

The obvious trade to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity is to put on a long/short pair trade. I’ve seen a few posts outlining this idea already. Basically, it would entail going long 1 share of APHA and short 0.8381 shares of TLRY. Theoretically this would capture the entire 30% dislocation as both companies trend towards their fair conversion ratio. There are, however, a few flaws/risks with this trade that should be considered. 

1. Borrow rates. In order to short TLRY you will need to pay interest to borrow the stock. This interest rate is quoted daily, and has fluctuated between 8-22% this past week (annualized). Assuming the holding period for this trade is 4 months - based on the merger occurring in Q2 - you would be paying 2.5-7.5% in interest at today’s rates. Now this doesn’t sound like a big deal because we’re capturing a 30% return right? Sure, assuming rates and share price remain at these levels. Now let’s assume TLRY continues to squeeze up to 100, now you’ve tripled your short position and need to pay triple the interest. Furthermore, the borrow rate will likely increase with price, and we’ve seen extreme borrow rates before, sometimes even in excess of 100% (GameStop topped 150% for a short period last summer). Very quickly you can see that interest rates have the potential to eat away at your returns.

2. Margin requirements. Along the same lines as my first point, if TLRY squeezes back up to ATHs your broker is going to require significant margin to hold your position. Remember, even though this is theoretically a delta neutral play with the impending merger, your broker won’t recognize your long APHA position as a hedge against your TLRY short. There could come a point where the margin balance required to hold the trade won’t justify the max profit potential.

Okay - so how do we play this then?

I’m suggesting a play that involves going long APHA shares and hedges with ITM TLRY puts. Specifically, let’s look at the June 100p. It would look something like this using Friday close numbers:

Long 100/0.8381 = 119.32 shares of APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p on TLRY

Premium on the puts is 75.525. 

If, at expiry TLRY trades at or below below 100, then the profit will be:

APHA
(P-16.94)*119.32*0.8381

TLRY
(100-P)*100 - 75.525*100

= 426.26

Essentially what we’re doing here is paying a slight premium on the put to lock in the short interest rate on TLRY and remove margin risk (we are essentially locking in the margin required for the trade - eliminating the risk of getting margin called if TLRY squeezes). 

Now the beauty of this trade is that you are now also delta positive. Assuming price dislocation does not increase, you are poised to capture another spike in APHA’s share price, profiting disproportionately on your long shares (because the delta of your TLRY put will trend down). Therefore there could be an opportunity to close the trade early for a profit - but if not you are secured by the fundamentals of the merger conversion ratio at expiry.


I believe using this strategy is at least lower risk than the long/short pair trade. This being said, there is still risk - and that is if for some reason the merger does not go through. This is unlikely, but possible. If this is the case, it is my speculative opinion that APHA will still outperform TLRY. My evidence for this that APHA traded at a higher per share value than TLRY pre-merger announcement in December. Upon announcing the deal, APHA sold off - indicating that the street saw the merger as an over pay for APHA. This assumption could be distorted by the political events that have ensued since that merger (it could be argued that the blue senate disproportionately benefits the American based TLRY compared to the Canadian based APHA). However, it is still my biased opinion that APHA is the better company absence of the merger.

TLDR:

Long 119.32 shares APHA

""It is important to understand the different types of funds."" -Yuri

Daytime BP = Settled funds + Unsettled funds + Available Margin 

Overnight BP = (Settled funds + Unsettled funds - MINUS MAINT REQ)

&amp;#x200B;

It is imperative to understand the difference between Unsettled CASH and Unsettled MARGIN. Having NEGATIVE Unsettled CASH means you will be issued a margin call to meet the MAINT REQ for your broker, EVEN IF you have a cash account you are subject to the MARGIN rules and procedures.

&amp;#x200B;

 WHEN BUYING OR WRITING OPTIONS :

You are using margin. When you receive a credit, it is (+) positive unsettled margin. However, if you buy to close and complete the transaction with (-) negative unsettled margin funds, even if you have (+) positive unsettled cash, that exceeds your unsettled margin, to show positive unsettled funds and positive account balance, you could still have NEGATIVE UNSETTLED MARGIN.

&amp;#x200B;

What does this mean?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you effectively have received a MARGIN GFV (good faith violation) while it is not on record, you will be unable to open new margin positions, until this violation is lifted either by wiring funds prior to (NOT ACH but WIRE only) 14:00 hours EST, or waiting until the margin funds settle.

Avoid NEGATIVE UNSETTLED MARGIN (basically never have negative unsettled funds) by purchasing to close positions with available BP only.

DO NOT USE MARGIN TO CLOSE SHORT POSITIONS IN A CASH ACCOUNT. I learned the hard way guys, but now I know that I must be very careful with my fund management.

swapnil_08,0.0,5.0,"I have recently started looking into spreads and different types of it. As far as I can understand the main 2 disadvantages of Call Debit Spreads even in worst scenarios are,

1. The fact that you cap your maximum gain at the difference between the spread strike prices in case, the stock takes a rocket to the moon and potentially end up missing out on a lot more gain than what you would get from the spread.

2. If the stock expires below your lower leg strike price you end up loosing entire amount you paid for the spread. Or if it expires below the breakeven you would loose some of the premium.

greenday10Dsurfer,0.0,6.0," Hi  there all, as my nick suggests i owe my humble option trading  beginnings to WSB (shout out to all the WSB-ers - lurkers/anonymous and  otherwise)... I am here, and going around reddit trying to learn so i  can dig out of a quagmire i lately find myself in....   and  was wondering if I can get some help analyzing the following strategy I  devised which in my mind appears great but too good to be true... I have  decent, at least imo, understanding of option basics especially  calls/covered calls but again thinking this can not be this easy and  what I could be missing/misunderstanding

So here is the scoop:

I  currently hold 600 shares of GME (got in on margin at $64 pre-run; held  through the highs b/c you know the whole HOLD THE LINE thingy; left  close to 250K of unrealized gains on the table) so obviously holding bag  now as GME is on a steady and relentless decline.  Thinking of how to  mitigate losses an idea came to me to sell CC's against my 600 shares.   Looking at the chain it appears jan/22 and jan/23 bid ask spreads are  somewhere b/w $20 - $25 for strikes b/w $60-$70; need to do a bit of  math to see which will yield greatest premium to loss advantage.  So i  figured what if i sell 6 contracts against my 600 shares, collect b/w  12K-15K of premium ( which appears to be greater than my current losses)  and then either use the premium to buy more shares and write new CC's  on those newly purchase shares and repeat until i run out of shares all  at the same time lowering my total PPS average.  At this point i don't  really mind letting go (getting assigned) of shares especially if those  do end up going to strike, or if continues to go lower I can then use  some new funds to purchase at lower SP and repeat the CC's writing cycle  again to continue considerably lowering PPS.... So obviously i think to  myself - What can go wrong?

thevagabond007,0.0,5.0,"Long story short, my mother-in-law is retired and spends a lot of time day trading and making other investments. She was managing a decent amount of my wife's money from before we were married a few years ago. I never thought much of it as she was making a decent enough return, I don't have the time to be as active on the markets as she is, and I don't have much of an interest in meddling in my wife's finances. Anyway, my wife and MIL got into a fight and my MIL has asked us to take over the accounts she was managing. My wife has no desire or time to understand the markets so it's left up to me to at least manage the open options.

I did some research on puts and calls, and  was able to talk to my MIL a bit about the open options over email but I don't fully understand her explanations and was  hoping somebody could provide a more basic explanation. There are quite a few open options but I'll describe one call and one put and provide the answers I received from my MIL next to my questions on them:

Open option #1 =  **FSLR Jan 21 2022 65 Call**

**-** My understanding of this option is that it is a call purchase of FSLR that will expire on Jan 21, 2022 and the strike price is $65. So, essentially, if the FSLR stock price is over $65 on the day this expires we will be able to ""sell"" the option for that price and make the difference between $65 and the closing price less any premium paid

\- I asked my MIL whether my understanding was correct but she provided me the following explanation (caveat that English is not her first language):  *The rule of selling option is that the seller has an obligation to sell the contract at the price that we agreed on, which was $65. When I sold the contract at the price of $50, the stock price was only $42.13. I had sold 5 times of cover calls at prices from $50, $55, $57.5, $60, and $65, which gained the total premium of $693 already. This is the risk that we have to take since we didn't know how stock would go. If we sold stock early which might be at $55, we only gained $300. I would focus on how much I had won instead of how much I would win since no one can predict the stock trends. We can't sell at higher price even though the stock is much higher. We can roll to a higher price at a late expiration date though. That's what I was doing last time. Our gain actually is: ($65-$52)\*100=$1300+$693+$144=$2137, which is 41% (=$2137/$5200, where can you get such high return in one year?). If I had known stock went so high, I might not sell the cover call at all and gain what you said here $3300. However, if stock goes south, what would you say? We would lose even more, the max loss is $5200.* 

QUESTION: I am having trouble following the logic of her selling 5 times of cover calls and  how she calculated the gain currently on the various options she sold? How can we have made the premium on this current open call option if we haven't sold anything yet?

Open Option #2 =  **OKE Apr 16 2021 32.5 Put**

\- My understanding of this is that she sold a put option with a strike price of $32.50, which means that if the stock doesn't hit that price by April 16, 2021, then we keep the premium that was paid. If it does hit that price then we have to purchase the stock at $32.50 and may lose even further if we were to sell the stock at a loss.

\- Her response to this understanding is:  *We don't care how much it drops. As long as it drops down below $32.5, we have to sell the stocks. That's it. Anything else is not our concern and does not reflect our gain any more since all the premium had paid upfront.*

QUESTION: Do we really not care how much it drops? It seems as though she's understating what could happen if the stock plunges drastically below $32.50.

GunsAndEHTaylor,0.0,5.0,"Hi Everyone,

I am new to options and still reading to learn before I jump in. I am also paper trading to get a sense for how different strategies are implemented. With that being said, I am trying to confirm my understanding of the poor man's covered call. 

I understand the way I may have set up my example may be fundamentally flawed in some way, but hope that it is still useful as a representative example. 

Let's say I am looking at BAC, which is currently trading at $33. I buy to open BAC Jan 2022 $27 call for my long call for a debit of 4.8. Additionally I sell a short call, Mar 5 21 $36. I plugged this into ETrade and this would earn me a premium of 0.2. 

If all goes according to plan this option expires worthless on Mar 5 and I earn the full premium. Alternatively, I could buy to close my position before expiration, though that would eat into the already low premium. I could also roll up or roll out depending on how the underlying moved.

All of that to get to my question, which is about me better understanding my risk. Suppose I get assigned on the Mar 5 $36 C. I would have to exercise my long call, costing me $2700-$20 (premium credit)+$480 (premium debit) = $3160. However, since the underlying stock is now at $36, would I net the difference?

Just the numbers:

Current price BAC $33

sell Mar 5 21 $36 C for $20 credit

buy Jan 22 $27 C for $480 debit

Worst case I get assigned and my loss is $2700+480-20 = $3160

I now own the 100 shares and can deliver them at the $36 strike, so $3600-3160 = net profit of $440

PFE is expected to gain $15 billion in increase revenue because of the covid vaccine in 2021, which is a 20-30% increase in revenue. I don't think this is priced in yet.

**The Trade:**

Buy long dated calls. PFE volatility is super low and calls are cheap AF. I bought 50 delta September calls for \~$200.

**Now expanding on this:**

\- Yes PFE stock price shot up and back down in December, bc of the news of FDA approval. People got scared out of their positions and the price dropped way wayyy back down, and its at a solid support to buy from right now.  high upside, low downside at this point.

\- The operational costs, and research &amp; development costs were priced in last year, (for the most part). This is why they had low earnings last year. They had the upfront operational costs for the vaccine, but they had no actual revenue yet, bc the vaccine had not been distributed.

\- Expected 2 billion doses to deliver by end of 2021, but may change if additional contracts are signed. So there is even more potential revenue growth. The revenue growth will probably peak in 2021 and taper off in 2022. However, the view of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla is, "" I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting now.""

\- There is a ton of negative attention on PFE stock right now. It seems to be nothing to do with the fundamentals, but just the fact that the stock is boring and not moving. But there has been the idea floating around that the covid vaccine isnt a money maker. I actually thought this myself before i started to research it.  Here is some of the ridiculous negative comments [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnowlf/why_did_game_changing_vaccine_stocks_like_pfe/)  [two](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411363-pfizer-unique-portfolio-outside-of-vaccine#comment-88202614)

 \- Micheal Burry has 15% of his portfolio in long calls on PFE. However  noteworthy, Warren Buffet did exit his PFE position last year. 

\- Diving a little deeper into the trade idea. Buying calls is a brilliant play and credit goes to this [guy](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408976-pfizer-stock-buy-historically-cheap-call-options). PFE is sitting at a historic lows of implied volatility (IV). This means calls are cheap. Next earnings will be in 2 months, so there will be an increase in volatility up until that point. So my calls will gain value even if the stock price doesnt move. This will also provide some cushing even if the stock price does go down.

(Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets Inc., the popular trading app, plans to list its shares on Nasdaq when it goes public this year, according to people familiar with the matter.

No final decision has been made and Robinhood’s listing plans could change, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. CNBC first reported the Nasdaq news on Friday.

A representative for Robinhood didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Nasdaq declined to comment.

Robinhood plans to confidentially file for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as this month, people familiar with the matter said last week.

Robinhood became immensely popular during the pandemic, as homebound young people turned to online trading to pass the time and make money. But its role at the center of the so-called meme-stock frenzy has drawn questions from politicians and regulators. It’s also had to raise money from its backers to comply with a request from the industry’s clearinghouse.

Hello,

I'm kind of new to options, hoping to get some opinions here.

I was invested in KMPH at $7 for 600 shares. Recently on March 3rd, the stock gapped up due to a drug FDA approval and opened at 70-80% higher (\~17$) from the previous day.

In these situations where there's a major gap up would it be good to sell covered calls to take advantage of the increase in volatility?

If the stock continues to rise, well then, I guess my profit is capped but I still walk away with a nice return. But if the stock drops (which it did) at least I'm slightly hedged with the additional profits from the premium I collected.

Can someone point me in the right direction?

Been in the market for over a decade, just started playing with options this year. I am a retard. Ok, now that’s out of the way...

Am I a total fool for this strategy? For stocks that I love, I’ll sell covered calls FAR OTM to pocket some premium, though small, and at the same time sell cash secured puts OTM but much closer to strike. Seems like a good way to slowly build a position in a stock you like, and make some cash on the side. But as is life, if you think you’re on to something you’re usually AFU.

Hatueyc,0.0,4.0,"I've been in $NVDA with a the following spread $NVDA $595/$710 Exp APR 16th 2021 (5 contracts)

I'm down more than $10,000 in that position which again I am fine with. 

Currently $NVDA is down due to the market conditions/scarcity/tech sell offs and is at $500 which is fine, I do believe they will be back to $600 by the end of the month, maybe higher. The reason I felt a chill in my spine today is the following email from Robinhood regarding early assignment?   


Important: NVDA Early Assignment Risk   
Options Upcoming Dividend

Hi ####, NVDA will lock in dividends for its shareholders on Mar. 9, 2021. Because of this, you’re at a much greater risk of being assigned on your short NVDA calls, so you should consider closing these positions. **If you are early assigned and have a short equity position on Mar. 9, 2021, you’ll be responsible for paying the dividend instead of receiving it .***Please carefully review your positions and consider rolling forward or closing out some or all of the spreads with this risk in your account. You may also consider exercising the corresponding long leg of the spread prior to the ex-dividend date to capture the upcoming dividend. You can do this by reaching out to our support team. If you do not take action, we may close out positions to protect you from the upcoming dividend risk.*  


I guess I have a few important questions: Please keep in mind that I understand that you are not my broker and any response you post I accept fully at my own risk and also understand it is not investment advice but simply a topic for the sake of discussion.   


1. Just how great is the risk of early assignment? With NVDA recovering in this case one would want to see the contracts go until mid April. Is being OTM increasing the risks here?  

2. Exercising of contracts (x100 per) is not something I'm interested in. I mean what in this situation as a case study can someone do to avoid losing more than they invested. I'm 1, fine losing that money I initially put in, knowing options were a risk but exercising early due to dividends is an added layer of complexity that has really confused my thinking here, this obviously adds more losses to the equation  

3. Is there a way to offload the short end of the contract. Meaning if when market opens could I close the $720 legs and technically have a Naked or long call option at $595. I'm trying to put together the math here in this scenario. Does this make sense...  

4. Alternative routes in the this scenario that allow me to 1-\_&gt; avoid losing more that what I put in, 2 --&gt; Break even, 3--&gt;See through on profits when NVDA goes back to 600+ end of this month/Early April. Any thoughts or strategies here?

Nucksy1,0.0,2.0,"I am a new investor overall, and have been tinkering for a year or so with minimal success after a break when I lost my shorts buying in the height of the 2018 cannabis buzz in Canada legalization period. 

Read about RKT on stocks and bought my first call options expiring at the end of this week for cheap last Friday when the stock was around $22, along with around 20 shares. 

I woke up yesterday morning and my $0.16 options were worth $1.00 so I sold them feeling like a boss (shortly after they were $5+). I also bought a couple $35c options for $0.47 and sold those for $3.85 (they hit $15.80 or something lol, fuck.)

I’m pumped on the gain, but all I can think about is the missed potential gain lol.

My other 9 option plays are deep in the red though lol so I know this was a fluke and that more than likely I’ll get my ass handed to me. I read that buying calls and puts on the same stock might be beneficial so am trying that but bought super cheap way OTM calls and am thinking that maybe it’s better to pay more and get closer to ITM calls even though it’s a bigger premium because overall the upside is bigger? 

I recognize now that RKT the last few days was a lucky move and not every day you are going to get 1,000%, or 10,000% like the people with awesome timing. 

Immediately after close I started watching YouTube videos and it was an option instructional video saying 9 out of 10 call options expire worthless and a 1,000% is usually rare. Is that true or are options just a seemingly better way to play the stock market with way more upside potential? 

When you folks consider your options strategies, do you sell off portions at a time to hedge your bets and take profits slowly? Even if I kept 1 of the options longer through the day as a lotto ticket, it would have substantially increased the gains. 

 I was able to get out of the shares this morning for the mid $30’s so overall I’m more than stoked overall. 

I picked up some puts today at $22.50 and $17 strike, but they expire Friday so I’m thinking it’s not enough time and they’re likely lost causes barring another bloody day tomorrow.

I’m not one to bet against the crowd, but I ate a pretty fat edible today and it just seemed like a good idea.

I'm assuming that the bulk of the activity in this call is made up of the players that are short the stock, creating a synthetic long by selling a put and buying a call.

I went to buy 1 contract for $0.20 (totaling $20). On Webull, it shows your maximum gain/loss, with gain being unlimited and loss being $20. Hit place order, and it said “Insufficient Buying Power” and something about options being risky (duh), and to try lessening the number of contracts I wanted to buy, and try again. But I was only trying to buy 1, so I’m not sure why that would be. I tried to get the exact alert text again, but it’s after hours so I just got that alert instead.

I have $250 or so in that account, which is a cash account. The funds aren’t settled (T+2), but I read from others they could buy options on unsettled funds (just not sell without a GFV). I have been able to buy stocks/ETFs on unsettled funds. I also was approved for Level 2 options and attempted to buy an OTM call, so to my understanding, that should have went through.

Any reason for that dilemma? The only thing I could imagine is that I was approved for covered calls, cash-covered puts, long calls / puts, and it was declined because I had insufficient funds to exercise that contract. But I asked that question yesterday (as I’d rather not have funds to exercise in that account if I’m not planning to exercise, just to be safe) and everyone said that wouldn’t be an issue.

Also, bonus question!: When I was trying to place the order for the ask at 0.18, I got an alert that for options in decimals, I had to place orders in 0.05 increments (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, etc.). Is that normal (on Webull or in general)? And if so, how do I see others with bids not in 0.05 increments? For various strikes at a glance, I see asks for 0.67, 0.12, 0.08. I think the phone app allowed you to place the order at the ask or bid (and I was ordering on my laptop), but I may have got the same alert once I hit place order on my phone. I ended up just trying to place 0.20 for a 0.18 ask. I’m guessing, even in that case, it would still fill at 0.18 (unless it increased to 0.20 between the time I placed it and when it filled)?

Graydrake1,0.0,4.0,"**Rule of Thumb on Portfolio Management for Stocks** 

Most guidelines suggest no more than 4% of your portfolio value be put in any one ticker.  This means a portfolio of any size has 25 holdings.   Recognizing via the selection of good companies,  the most you rationally expect to lose on any one ticker is about 25%, and this would only be 1% of your total holdings.

**Assessment of Risk - Stocks vs. Options**

Some options have defined losses, such as long calls, so I will limit my comments to these.  If a ticker does not move in your direction you may lose 100% of the option value.  If you have 25 option positions of the equivalent original value, you will have lost 4% of your portfolio asset value.  This loss is 400% larger than the most severe loss a trader might rationally expect in a stock portfolio.

**A Rule of Thumb for Sizing Option Positions.**

If you agree with the Rule of Thumb for a stock portfolio of max. 4% allocation for any one ticker, AND wish to pursue the same level of risk in each option position, your max. dollar allocation should only be approximately 1/4 of a typical stock position.   

**Conclusion**

* For most portfolio sizes the 4 to 1 ratio in allocation size is not practical, but options traders need to be aware of the added risk that options represent, and rationally restrict their dollar allocation to individual option positions accordingly.
* I am an options trader, I make about 400 trades per year and typically beat the market on an annual basis.   You can offset the initial obvious added risk of options, because of the power of their flexibility in all market conditions.  Failure to engage a strategy acknowledging the risk difference between stocks and options in portfolio management, however, brings a sudden and painful end to the trading careers of too many.",1,A General Comment on Sizing Option Positions,4.0,0.83,"A General Comment on Sizing Option Positions **Rule of Thumb on Portfolio Management for Stocks** 

Most guidelines suggest no more than 4% of your portfolio value be put in any one ticker.  This means a portfolio of any size has 25 holdings.   Recognizing via the selection of good companies,  the most you rationally expect to lose on any one ticker is about 25%, and this would only be 1% of your total holdings.

**Assessment of Risk - Stocks vs. Options**

Some options have defined losses, such as long calls, so I will limit my comments to these.  If a ticker does not move in your direction you may lose 100% of the option value.  If you have 25 option positions of the equivalent original value, you will have lost 4% of your portfolio asset value.  This loss is 400% larger than the most severe loss a trader might rationally expect in a stock portfolio.

LifeStuffAndThings,0.0,4.0,"Hey Guys,

Naked calls are a terrible idea and can really blow up your account. I have traded spreads and cash covered puts for a few years, but I have never taken positions that risk me being margin called.

Because of this, I have a question regarding writing far OTM Naked Calls on the date of expiry. The main reason I have not written naked calls in the past is due to the amount of power it gives the broker as a retail trader. They can raise margin requirements on a specific equity at will or the margin requirements raise when massive IV jumps occur and raise the underlying contract price. Both these result in margin calls and losses even if the written calls would have been profitable at expiry.

From my understanding, margin calls must be fulfilled end of day and if done so your position will not be liquidated. If you open up a far OTM naked call position on the day of expiry and your margin requirements move against you putting you in a margin call, but the call does not go ITM... what happens when trading ends and the calls expire?

Thanks for helping in advance. I know this sounds extremely risky, I'd just like to know what happens in these circumstances. If it is really stupid to do this, I'll stick to cash covered puts.

**Edit:**Well I stated it in a comment below, so here is the dumb idea:

My question here is directly related to whether a naked call position will be closed intraday if it is still OTM, but you are outside of your margin requirements due to a large intraday move.

Hate to use the meme ticker, but please blow up this idea:

GME - 800c exp Feb 26 - is currently going for 2.66$.

Let's say tomorrow it opens at $0.50 and GME remains at \~$165 on open.

I write a bunch of 800c exp Feb 26 calls on open for $0.50 that max out my allowed margin requirements for my broker (my broker has ridiculous margin requirements for this stock).

Intraday GME runs to $400 off of a gamma squeeze and takes the 800 exp Feb 26 contract to $2.00 for awhile. I get margin called for being x4 out of compliance on my margin. However, the gamma squeeze ends at $400 and does not make it to $800 (due to trading halts, shenanigans, whatever). At end of day, I was x4 out of margin requirements however it will expire OTM.

What is the impact of this trade and why is it dumb?

If there is a big stock price run-up pre-market in GME, then this play loses it's lustre. However, if it opens still in the high $100 range. I am willing to put a lot of money on the line that says that a multi-billion dollar company will not go x4 in a single day. It has also been proven that moves this large are shut down by brokerages, so I believe that fraud will be committed before the 800C 2/28 calls will be ITM.

I'd rather make money with the crooks than be beat by them.",1,Writing Far OTM Naked Calls on Date of Expiry?,4.0,0.75,"Writing Far OTM Naked Calls on Date of Expiry? Hey Guys,

WhatWhyNotCare,0.0,4.0,"Hi all new to options. I’ve done quite a bit of reading and I think wheeling a blue chip might be the safest/simplest strategy for now. One thing I don’t like about most wheel suggestions, though is the cash secured part, which to me is dead weight.  

Allow me to explain. I’m an index fund investor. Although I hold almost all of it in equities I consider myself relatively conservative compared to most people here. Though I’d probably be seen as an aggressive investor in the pf subreddit (my 1 year emergency fund is in bond ETFs - again, don’t like cash because it’s dead weight). Currently I’ve got $400k invested in all world index funds. I expect that to make about 7-9% per year. I consistently put about $4000 each month into index funds. That part of my strategy won’t change, but I was wondering if I could wheel a blue chip on margin and not go bust. 

Here’s my strategy:  
1. Put $100k of my portfolio into a discount broker, to shield the majority of my portfolio from bad decision making.
2. Find a blue chip that I’d be a permabull on. eg. I’ve been permabull on Apple for 10 years now
3. Risk up to 20% of portfolio selling naked 30-45DTE puts. If puts are exercised, I buy on margin. In the case of Apple, it’s about $12k right now.
4. If the put gets exercised, flip the wheel and sell weekly calls on it at the same strike price. As long as the calls don’t get sold, I pay about $25/month to the broker for the margin. Once the calls get exercised, pay back broker. However, I’m collecting premiums which offset the margin interest.
5. Using premiums, buy more ETFs, or buy a riskier long term play like $BB.

Upside scenario: At current volatility / option prices, about $1600-$2000 per year. Every time puts get exercised, I sell weekly calls which pay off the margin in 1-2 weeks. I make an extra 7-9% having stayed invested in index funds instead of holding cash.

Downside risk: 20% market correction happens. I bag hold the Apple stock. Try to sell monthly calls at original strike price - if there’s liquidity. I pay off the margin portion within 2-3 months using my paychecks, though considering today’s interest rates I’d likely just risk buying more ETFs and pay interest instead in a market correction.

Worst case: 2008 event occurs, both my ETFs and Apple stock are down 50+%. I lose my job, am unable to pay margin. I bag hold and am jobless.

Impossible worst case: Market goes down 80-90%, I get margin called. I’ve lost $100k. Money probably becomes meaningless. Start stocking up on ammo.

Again the reason I want to use margin instead of CSP is because I expect 7-9% if I’d use that cash to buy index funds instead. Let’s say 8% - $12k is like $1000/yr on index funds, whereas the wheeling only has upside up to $2000. Hardly worth it. However if I do it on margin I get both $2000 from premiums + $1000 from staying invested in index funds. About 25% return ($3k / $12k) on the amount I risk. That would double in 3 years and I’d be playing with “house money”.  


Are there any risks I’ve overlooked and is this strategy feasible for a conservative investor like me?

sethamphetamine,0.0,2.0,"Hello, I wish I had someone else to ask what may be a simple question.  I've been reading about credit spreads and have found conflicting information.

Anybody else have a clever trade, that takes into account the investors who are just itching to get their 365 days out of the stock so they can have long-term capital gains tax rate instead of short term?

20% of profit for a “buy and hold” investor is a big difference. 

One year ago, the market began its infamous dump. People snatched up shares at a massive discount, imagine buying QCOM at $60 a share...or CRWD at $40!

I have a theory that once many of these investors hit the 365-day mark, they will sell, or at bare minimum trim their MASSIVE profits, and since they held for a year, only be subject to around 15% capital gains tax, rather than the 40%.

Recently with think or swim the order execution has been horrible. If anyone has traded today February 23, 2021 with TD Ameritrades Think Or Swim platform you know what I mean.   
Couldn't get filled on orders, and not only that when trying to cancel an order the cancel request doesn't go through and fills you in that order 1 or 2 full minutes later. Since I scalp option premiums this is a big big risk. Someone I know reached out to TD today to ask if they have anything in their tech pipeline to address this and the answer is basically no, they have no plan on fixing the lag issue as of now.

I wanted to know if anyone has experience with other brokers or can compare brokers and know which has the best order execution and fills?

Someone I know reached out to TD today to ask if they have anything in their tech pipeline to address this and the answer is basically no, they have no plan on fixing the lag issue as of now.

I wanted to know if anyone has experience with other brokers or can compare brokers and know which has the best order execution and fills?   


I work on a Mac (i know some say thats not good but i cant change my machine just yet) so I can't use tradestation since its only windows compatible.

booty_legend,0.0,5.0,"Hey everyone! I'm new to options and the strategies that come along with it. The selling side has definitely caught my eye as an extra source of income. I was curious regarding a strategy. When selling CC and CSP on a stock like SPX that has option expirations every few days, why wouldn't someone just sell a CC for example ATM to collect the most premium, then assuming you're assigned do the same with a CSP, again collecting the premium. If the stock doesn't move too much within that time period and you aren't losing out much on the upside, what is wrong with this strategy (I'm using the term strategy loosely since this isn't much of a strategy). Obviously the goal is not be assigned, but it really doesn't matter in the grand scale of things. Granted you would have to have around $40,000 on hand or margin per contract, but making around $2,000 every few days doesn't sound all that bad.

I'm currently doing ALL my trading on TD's ThinkorSwim platform with paper money, and I saw something today that I couldn't understand.  I hope you fine folks can help.

Underlying:  NVDA   Date:  Today, February 23, 2021

In two orders, I bought 20 ITM 550 Calls at a price of 18.50 per contract during the morning downslide of the stock.  My strategy is a gap play whereby I buy CALLs on the opening downgap, expecting the stock price to rise to close the gap by Contract Expiration (even better if it's the same day).  At that point, I sell the CALL Options to exit the Position(s).

EDIT:  Based on the first reply below, I did buy 10 NVDA shares during the downturn about midday, an Equity Position, not an Option Position.

Total cost for the two (2) Filled Orders was $37,000, or $18,500 each.  I used the green ""POS"" (funny to type that) flags on the Trade tab to initiate a Closing Order on the 20 Open 550 Contracts.  In the Order Entry section, I selected the following:SINGLE,  SELL,  -20,  TO CLOSE,  NVDA,  26-FEB 21, (WEEKLY),  550,  CALL,  29.10,  LIMIT,  DAY,  BEST

Other OPEN positions include (NVDA):

EXP                               STRIKE  TYPE     QTY    PRICE       MARK                MARK VALUE

What is confusing me is my Account Statement section called Profits and Losses now shows ""Margin Req"" of $2826.95 where there was none before selling the 20 550 Call Options.  Do you know why that triggered a Margin requirement if I was closing a Long Call Position?

DutchOverlord,0.0,5.0,"I brushed up my knowledge of various options strategies. And I also touched upon probably the most basic one, selling covered calls.  I am curious what the collective knowledge is on this matter. Basically, you have two sides on the spectrum for selling covered calls. 1. Selling covered calls on hardly volatile underlying assets with an expiration date of fewer than 3 months. 2. Selling covered call on volatile underlying assets with an expiration date that is larger than 3 months.  Classical risk versus return approach. 

What side are you leaning towards and why?

For me personally, I use selling covered calls to scrape a bit of extra cash on assets that I don't intend to sell. So I lean towards the hardly volatile assets and selling with a short expiration date (mostly less than a month out).

greenday10Dsurfer,0.0,4.0,"Hello all, i am rather new to options but am trying to learn as much as possible and and am supplementing my limited knowledge with trading rather smaller positions trying to get the feel for the process, order placement, monitoring etc.  (mostly \~$100 calls/puts; a couple of covered calls; no CSP's yet).  An idea had popped into my head and i wanted to get some perspective from more experienced option traders.  Any feedback/criticism, advise, suggestion, point of view is appreciated.

I have, for some time now (around 7yrs), been diamondhanding BB shares 5500 @ 7.77 so needless to say - i like the stock; now after learning a bit about options i'm thinking that due to my ignorance i've most likely  given up on some decent opportunities to perhaps making some additional scratch selling CC's. 

For many years now - us, BB permabulls would gather round Stocktweet side to discuss and revel in the ideas and expectations that that year is the year BB will finally get recognized for the great value and unmatched potential it has compared to peers.  This year is no different, however this year i believe BB actually has some tangible developments and partnerships in the pipeline  to show for and ""general"" public is beginning to finally get the idea that BB is NOT A PHONE COMPANY!!! but i digress...

So BB shares 5500 @ 7.77 

BB is not known for wild swings and insane gap-ups (w exception or recent rather wild moves co-related with GME saga); 

Barring any black swan events i am very bullish on BB for 2021 but believe it might decline a bit from recent levels of \~$10-\~12 or go sideways until more partnerships are done and/or ER is finally showing definite improvement in fundamentals (also BO/M&amp;A is a possibility imo)

I was looking at the option chain to far OTM LEAPS \~$22 strikes and as of last Friday the going bid for JAN23 is around $3.00

So if i'm not mistaken i were to write 55 contracts for those LEAPS that would bring close to $17K 

I'd very much to use the $17K and buy more BB shares +/- 1,700 shares depending on SP, then use the 1,700 shares and write more CC LEAPS (for simplicity sake for the same strike/exp); so that's 17 contracts and another $5K which i'd use to buy 500 BB shares and again write 5 more CC's for $1.5K and so on until i guess i'd end up w 7880 shares...

Now as i've mentioned earlier - I like the stock, so i don't mind holding, on the hand if SP does get to $22 it will be a very generous premium to my per share avg. and would not mind letting the shares get called away as i believe i might get opportunity to buy them back if i really wanted to using the settled funds and maybe at discount say on a dip (based on years of watching BB SP) ??

So is this above any type of strategy or am missing something so obvious that would make the whole thing unworkable or perhaps it's one of the least optimal ways to utilize CC's or anything else i might be missing/misunderstanding?

freesincemybirth96,0.0,2.0,"Hey all, I have a question with how options work regarding taxes.

A bit of backstory, my brother in law trades options on the side and he lets me in on a piece of the action occasionally. It's really kind of him and I'm nothing but thankful. Recently we both put in $275 ($550 premium) on calls that ended up being worth $1,230 total ($615 each). It's a great return, I'm definitely not complaining.

We got into a misunderstanding on taxes however. I received $615 - trading fees, which left with me around 592.50. I then deduced the initial cost to show only gains, then paid his tax bracket taxes on gains as well as a kickback, the math went as follows:

592.50 - 275 = 317.5

317.5 \* .28 (his tax bracket) = 88.9

88.9 + 69.85 (to give him half of my gains) = 158.75 (The amount I paid him)

&amp;#x200B;

He's saying my math is incorrect and I owe his tax bracket on gains/premium. Math as follows:

592.5 \* .28 (his tax bracket) = 165.9 (amount I owe him)

&amp;#x200B;

I've already paid the amount he asked since I'm netting positive without having to move a finger, and I'm definitely not trying to short him. I just think his math is be wrong and I'm curious if I'm just crazy here. Thanks!

on Feb12 forward CCIV SP started to rapidly rise in anticipation of merger news and my CC's quickly went into ITM territory; however i really didn't think of an exit strategy ( a mistake i am aware of but continue making weather it's trading shares or options but working on this issue); since i didn't have much of an exit strategy and frankly was not aware of the different methods i can employ i started to frantically searching for the info (eventually the article from Charles Schwab and embedded Covered Call Decision Matrix helped me to somewhat understand the possibilities; link below)

So after some deliberation when the CCIV was trading around $62 (HOD) i have decided and rolled out and up to 2 for 75 19APR - got about $500 in premium difference; at the time of making that call i was and still am very bullish on CCIV due to pending merger news (shares of CCIV slid to around $52 19FEB due to no merger confirmation imo)

Now i understand there were multitude of possibilities out there and it's rather impractical to analyze this even in retrospect even with info we have now to determine what would have been an optimum solution or perhaps i'm mistaken and missing something rather obvious what could have helped me make a better or different decision due to my currently relatively high level of ignorance on the  subject.

swingorswole,0.0,4.0,"Would like feedback on my strategy. I've been testing it and it works well so far but would like to see where I'm taking unnecessary risk, ways to better hedge if needed, etc. Right now I'm using relatively small positions for testing.

I have been daily looking for very high IVR stocks where there is &gt;= 50% price spike DAY OF; that has no specific event (no recent earnings, no other external factors); options must include strikes available with distance of either $1 or $2.5.

I watch the stock to wait for an ATH where the dip begins within a few hours of the ATH. Once that happens I:

1. Open the call credit spread with the short strike at &lt;= .25 delta
2. BTO a put at the original stock price pre-pump

With a condor spread, I believe I should be creating a call credit spread at the top and put credit spread at the bottom, but in this situation I don't really have a solid idea of how far down the stock can go -- only that 90% of pumps go down to the original price or lower. So I would just BTO a put so I can STC at a higher price after the pump dies.

Some issues I see right off the bat:

* On these p&amp;d stocks, sometimes when I BTO a put I am at risk because there is very low volume for that put at the BTO
* The stock could go into what I think looks like a bear trap but in fact keeps going up past my short strike on my call credit spread

Would love feedback on this approach, pitfalls, and all the mistakes/assumptions I may be making here.

debussyxx,0.0,3.0,"For example, I was watching some OEG calendar spreads two days ago. The 15/15 for June/April was actually *higher* the day before it dropped almost 10% the next day. Of course, this being a delta positive position (calendar spread), this spread should have gone down when the stock fell 10%, but yet it went up a small amount. But if I was just scrolling through and buying options happy-go-lucky without knowing the spread prices the previous day, then I might have bought the spread thinking it was less than the previous day of course because the price was down a lot and so I thought I was getting a good entry.

I haven’t just seen this behaviour on this ticker,   but on a lot of stocks, even ones that are very liquid (the bid and ask spreads were small on OEG by the way).

At this point my game plan is to either just sell and take the loss and convert the remaining money into shares or just sell and wait for IV to hopefully drop some more then maybe reopen my positions.

Say I owned 100 of an underlying, currently trading at $49. I can sell **March** 19th 40P for $3.3 credit, and sell an **April** 19th 55C for $8.05, for a total credit of $11.35.

If the underlying drops past my $40 put and I get assigned, my total cost basis after credit received on assignment is $28.65, which is a very attractive price for this security.

If the underlying blows past $55 and my 100 shares get called away, I'm selling them for $66.35 after Credits received, which is a price I'd be thrilled to sell them at anyways.

If (best case scenario?) I get assigned in March on my puts, and the underlying recovers and I get assigned again in April on my calls, I'm essentially buying the underlying at $28.65 and re-selling it for $55, while retaining my original 100 shares and starting the trade over again.

find_your_moon,0.0,4.0,"Hey all,

I’ve been learning about options for a bit now and have gained a lot from the posts here and elsewhere on Reddit, so I figured I’d check with you guys on whether I’m understanding things.

Just to be clear, I haven’t made any options trades yet and I’m not in a rush to do anything until I get it all figured out. Just trying to stretch my wings a bit first by playing with different hypothetical scenarios.

During my hypothetical games, I thought of an approach that I’ve not read about, but think may be valid. Let me know if I’m on the right path or if I’m missing something...

Scenario:
You own 100 shares of XYZ at $100 per share and the current price is at $50 representing an unrealized loss of $5000. Assume for now that you still believe that the price will eventually increase and it makes sense to hold rather than sell and move on...

In this case, can you use a covered call strategy by selling one OTM call to begin to reduce your loss by collecting the premium?

It seems that if you choose your strike correctly and have reasonable confidence that the price will not be increasing enough to put the call ITM, then you can choose higher premium strikes closer to the current stock price, but below your per share cost basis. This of course comes with the risk of being assigned and selling your 100 shares at a loss if you misjudged price action in the near term.

Following on from this, would you just continue to roll the covered call prior to each expiration date (weekly? monthly?) if conditions favor continued and lucrative premiums or let it expire OTM and sell the next weekly/monthly?

Do I have this right or is my logic flawed?",1,Covered calls to reduce unrealized losses?,4.0,0.76,"Covered calls to reduce unrealized losses? Hey all,

ChrisP2a,0.0,4.0,"  Hello.

Looking over my 1099…

Last year I had 5 vertical (long/debit) spreads of an equity, where 4 of them were assigned a couple days early, and I was short the stock. I still had the long calls. (In hindsight I think I should have just waited the expiration, but I bought back the stock at a loss.)

Two days later on expiration, my remaining spread expired, and I booked a profit of about $1k on that.

It seems a portion of my loss on the buy-back of the short sales (exactly 25%) is being disallowed as a wash sale. I assume because two days later I ended up booking a profit on the same security.

Am I interpreting this right? Could have I avoided that wash sale by just letting my 4 long options be assigned, and the short-sale then covered?

Hitch2281,0.0,4.0,"I don't think I'm an idiot but I'm also not smart enough to give financial advice. Read at your own risk, this is not financial advise. 

Out of all the earnings releases for next week I have three positions. ROKU, BIDU, and DBX (DBX is bit dodgy on the volume but thought I'd take the risk. 

For each I've done a strangle strategy for a net Credit and am looking to make my profit on the decrease in volatility after the earnings release, and to a lesser extent from some theta decay. Regarding Theta, I did pick the monthly's so it is a bit long for that at  33 days left. 

ROKU Sold 350Puts and 615Calls for a net credit of 16.35

BIDU Sold 240Puts and 400Calls for a net credit of 12.5

DBX Sold 20.5Puts and 28Calls for a net credit of 0.84

**Why These Stocks:**

liquidity: DBX being the worst of the three, they all have decent Option liquidity. Particularly compared to the other stocks with earnings releases this week. 

IV rank: I'm on the sell side of life on these ones. All three are trending a higher IV rank and I'm looking for a reversion back to the mean after earnings. 

Big Move Risk: With other tech companies having concluded their earnings release were not seeing the same big up swings we saw in the past two quarters. 

 

**Why a Strangle, the strike price, and DTE:**

Same as the ""big move risk"" With the recent earnings release of other tech stocks I've seen that it has been harder to get large moves to the upside. This is due to us being at all time highs. The degree of positivity, IMO, for enrings needs to be beyond crazy for us to see the same moves we saw in the past two quarters.  

With the current positive trend I don't see a big downside risk but admittedly have not done a deep dive into this. The market at the moment has a lot of resistance to the downside (not that it cant happen)

the strike prices are based roughly off of a 1 SD move.  This gives us a theoretical POP of about 78-85% based on the last time I checked the ITM Probabilities. 

I didn't want to go less then 1.5 weeks due to any Gamma risk. The weekly's in some cases just didn't have the volume that I look for. I also didn't want to extend farther out as I'm looking for Theta to help my strategy out. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing the position:**

These are all earnings plays and I'm not looking to hold the trade to expiry. If I can achieve it I'll be looking to close these positions out at \~50%

**Management:** 

Should these positions goo off side. I'd first look to roll up the untested side to collect a bit more credit and hope that the stock comes back in range. If not, next step is to roll out in time to collect credit and see, again, if it comes back in line.

I didn't want to go less then 1.5 weeks due to any Gamma risk. The weekly's in some cases just didn't have the volume that I look for. I also didn't want to extend farther out as I'm looking for Theta to help my strategy out. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing the position:**

These are all earnings plays and I'm not looking to hold the trade to expiry. If I can achieve it I'll be looking to close these positions out at \~50%

**Management:** 

Should these positions goo off side. I'd first look to roll up the untested side to collect a bit more credit and hope that the stock comes back in range. If not, next step is to roll out in time to collect credit and see, again, if it comes back in line.

I have 108 shares of OGI that I bought at $6.24. Bad move, I realize. I'm looking to sell a covered call at a $6 strike price with a premium of $0.68 expiring on March 19.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the problem that I really want to buy US options like Corsair, GameStop, Sundial and a bunch of penny stocks. I have been searching for a while through numerous reddit posts and internet pages and did not find a lot...

Somehow there is a legal problem that the float of US options are too high (above 0.8 or something like that) and that this is the reason why they can't be traded. We are only left with option certificates, which are useless as they only allow trading with useless stocks.

The only helpful reddit post I found was: [An incomplete list of Brokers dealing in USA securities in the EU and UK, and other countries.](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/brokers/) A quick summary of the list of brokers that ""should"" have US options:

* BanxBroker
* Degiro
* First Trade
* Flatex
* Lynx Broker
* Interactive Broker
* Questrade
* Saxo Bank
* Swiss Quote
* TastyWorks
* Think or Swim
* Trade republic
* Trade station Brokers

Opened an account on Trade Republic -&gt; not trading US options

Opened an account on Degiro -&gt; not trading US options

And tried opening one on BanxBroker -&gt; failed to open one as I seem to be a ""too small fish""

If anyone has an account on one of the brokers and can actually trade options, please let me know. Cause opening an account and all that takes ages and I really don't want to fight myself through the whole list.

So if any German person has any broker that he can trade US options with, I really would appreciate a comment. Or if some of the stuff that I reed is actually true with ""US options in EU are banned"" I also would appreciate a comment about this and why.

**TLDR: I am trying to find an answer to this question once and for all, and hopefully saving some other retards time searching though the web like me.**

&amp;#x200B;

Edit\* If someone found a broker could you also tell me if they automatically do your taxes or if they request your tax number via registration. (Im very lazy regarding document stuff)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit\* Forgot about this one, if you have such a dream broker do they charge you extra when trading US options?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit\* (Hopefully the last edit) As I'm still a ""small fish"" please add any minimum deposit amounts or monthly fees.

canadianbeaver,0.0,4.0,"APHA and TLRY have announced a merger: 1 APHA will become 0.8381.  Lots of you know this, but here’s a very lucrative and surprisingly safe way to play this merger.

APHA is currently trading at $21.36. Selling a slightly OTM ($20 CAD) 7/16 APHA put right now will yield ~$7 per contract. 

TLRY is at $32.16 USD, so is worth $41.81 CAD, and if every 1 APHA is worth 0.8381 TLRY, the current implied value of APHA at conversion is $35.04.  It’s got significant upside from its current $21.36, right?

I hear you already: “What if TLRY comes way down? APHA doesn’t have to go up!” And you’re totally right.

How much will TLRY come down?  Another 33%??  If it does, TLRY will be at $21.55 USD, or $28.01 CAD, meaning APHA is still worth $23.48 CAD, more than its current $21.36 price, and a fair bit more than the $20 strike price of the put you just sold.  The put would still expire OTM leaving your full $7 premium all yours.

In order for you to break even or come out behind you’d have to see APHA below $13 CAD ($20 strike less the $7 premium you received), meaning TLRY would have to drop below $11.93 USD ($13 CAD APHA price / 1.3 FX / 0.8381), a loss of 63%.  That’s a lot of downside protection.

Timing-wise, the 7/16 contract has 155 DTE; management has said repeatedly they expect the deal to close by the end of Q2 at the latest.  That’s 140 days away, so the arb gap will have fully closed as shares will have converted, or if the deal somehow gets pushed back, will be substantially closed by then.

IV is as high as it will ever be on APHA right now (look at the weekly chart!) so you’re getting the most premium on that time you ever could.  It’s about as low risk premium you’ll ever earn.

sainglend,0.0,4.0,"It sounds crazy? Nah, it will make sense. I'm typing from mobile while in bed, so we both want this brief.

One strategy that people often run is the wheel. Sell weekly (or monthly) puts until you get assigned (or roll). Then sell calls until you get assigned (or roll).

A more capital efficient way of doing this is a wide put credit spread. For example, I could sell a 33P ON KR for 19 FEB for .40. Or I could sell -33/+31 for .35. now I only need $200 to enter the position instead of $3300.

What does this have to do with an Iron Condor? An iron condor is generally built to be delta neutral, using a put credit spread at lower strikes and call credit spread at higher strikes, like +32P/-33P/-34C/+35C, with the max profit achieved if the underlying stays between the short strikes, 33 and 34. Suppose you open for a 0.6 credit, then the breakeven would be 32.4 / 34.6 and the max loss 0.4.

But what if your goal is the wheel? Then you can construct a bullish, lopsided Iron Condor! This doesn't work well with all stocks since premiums have to be decently high. Here's an example with a volatile stock, TLRY.

Let's examine +29P/-32P/-34C/+35C for 19 FEB.

Notice the put spread is wider, which allows you to capture more premium than a narrower spread while still limiting your downside risk. If you add the two credits together, say you can open this for a 2.20 credit. That's great! The goal should be that the credit is greater than the width of the call spread.

Possible extreme outcomes:

1. Underlying stays between 32/34, I keep $220.

2. Underlying spikes. Call spread experiences max loss. My profit is $120.

3. Underlying tanks. Max loss is width of the put spread minus the premium, 3 - 2.2 = $80 loss. OR I can close the 29P, and take assignment with an approximate .8 per share loss (with some pin risk; NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED with volatile stocks). Since this is a stock I wanted from the outset, I'd do the latter. 

So, even though this is a ""bullish"" iron condor, I'd use it when I'm short-term neutral to bearish on a stock I want.

I realize that part of it has to do with the bid/ask spreads and last trade price of each option. But how has this thing gone from $37 + change when I got in to over $43 at today's close ($3+ ITM), and I'm actually showing a net loss of $8.00 at the close ...

Now, implied volatility is at a staggering 211.22% which is obviously gonna widen bid/ask spreads and increase premiums significantly on the whole chain. But I didn't expect 1) RIOT to rise THAT quickly or 2) such a huge disparity between a highly favorable move in the underlying and my estimated gain/loss in my position on ThinkOrSwim ...

What the hell is going on here, and how should I manage this position? With the momentum Bitcoin is showing, I'm considering rolling up on the 48 call and widening this spread ... maybe to 50, 55 or even 60 ... at first I expected BTC/USD to cool off for a week before heading to $50K, but it seems that it's gonna exceed our expectations again (as usual!) as more money floods into the market. Or perhaps it'd be more beneficial to take advantage of this high IV and sell a put or put spread for net credit, possibly with a shorter lifespan and higher theta.

I'm really not sure, and I'm confused by ThinkOrSwim's evaluation of my unrealized gain/loss ... hoping some other experienced options traders can help me figure this one out!

DaFountain98,0.0,4.0,"ARK ETF’s are vicious. They are rooted in new fields/emerging industries, have risen in value much faster than traditional ETF’s and index funds, and contain major extrinsic value. I’ve been looking at ARKQ specifically for LEAP potential. Volatility is relatively low, especially when considering the rate of change in price in the past 180 days and some of the more heavily weighted stocks in the ETF (NIO, TSLA, etc). 

Now, I am concerned because I feel like some of the holdings are overbought and don’t support their growth. How safe can an ETF that is held in an experimental, mostly theoretical, and majority unprofitable industry be, truly?

Either way, I realized some gains on short-term SNDL calls and GME shares. I am the lucky 1% who did not hold the bag the past few weeks. Turned a minuscule ($30 initial, $700 in since then) investment into a roughly $1000 portfolio over the past 3 or 4 weeks.

I bought a 9/17 $120c at $5.10 and have the other half of my portfolio working short term ITM calls on various tickers. How risky is this? By technical analysis, it seems safe enough. Volatility below 40% at time of purchase, theta non existent, and the price has risen $30 consistently quarter over quarter.

If they both go in the money, I won’t be able to afford the premium on the $135 to buy myself out, and I won’t be able to sell the $120 because it’s being held as collateral. I fucked up and didn’t enter as a spread so I can’t close both positions simultaneously. I’m getting nervous and I might just close every other position to buy myself out of that cover and let the $120 ride, but then I will literally have all my eggs in that basket, and would have lost $200 for the pleasure.

Seasoned old-hands, lend me your ears.",4.0,0.84,"I’ve been speculating short-term with options for a year. Been doing some DD and reading up on LEAPs and Theta Gang theory. Seasoned old-hands, lend me your ears. ARK ETF’s are vicious. They are rooted in new fields/emerging industries, have risen in value much faster than traditional ETF’s and index funds, and contain major extrinsic value. I’ve been looking at ARKQ specifically for LEAP potential. Volatility is relatively low, especially when considering the rate of change in price in the past 180 days and some of the more heavily weighted stocks in the ETF (NIO, TSLA, etc). 

Now, I am concerned because I feel like some of the holdings are overbought and don’t support their growth. How safe can an ETF that is held in an experimental, mostly theoretical, and majority unprofitable industry be, truly?

Either way, I realized some gains on short-term SNDL calls and GME shares. I am the lucky 1% who did not hold the bag the past few weeks. Turned a minuscule ($30 initial, $700 in since then) investment into a roughly $1000 portfolio over the past 3 or 4 weeks.

I bought a 9/17 $120c at $5.10 and have the other half of my portfolio working short term ITM calls on various tickers. How risky is this? By technical analysis, it seems safe enough. Volatility below 40% at time of purchase, theta non existent, and the price has risen $30 consistently quarter over quarter.

mrwhooper,0.0,4.0,"I am currently selling PMCCs, by selling a weekly call at around .3 delta and buying the LEAP on the same stock/etf at around .8 delta. The leap is about 1 year away from expiry.

Most of these pmccs, when the sold call leg goes from OTM to ITM, the sold leg incurs a loss while the LEAP incurs a gain (Net profit). This is the normal and expected scenario.

However, on rare occasions, even when the sold call goes from OTM to ITM, the sold call shows a loss and the LEAP still shows a loss as well. This happened before with my BABA and GLD pmccs. Is it better to close these leaps for a loss, or wait for them to expire?

tracyXTMAC,0.0,6.0,"I am kinda new and recently learned about LEAPS, and just wonder if it is the best way to go long with ETFs. Specifically, I am referring to China-related indexes, like FXI.

Here’s my reasoning:
1) LEAPS amplifies ur buying power compared to holding actual stocks.
2)Most of the CN companies currently do not pay any dividend, so the gain solely depends on stock price increase, which LEAPS can deliver just as well.
3)ETFs tend to be less volatile so IV is minimal.

Am I missing anything? Is there any reason ppl should hold actual ETF shares over LEAPS?

And it also got me thinking, why don’t we also do LEAPS with, say, the ARK funds. Since they are mostly on growth stocks and hence not a lot of dividend yield, we are basically betting on price going up to make profit, and with LEAPS we can potentially avoid the 0.75% fee (not sure about this one tho, can someone confirm?).

Edit: looks like we cannot escape the fees thru LEAPS/options.

notathr0waway1,0.0,5.0,"Hey guys first post so please be gentle.

So I work in IT and Solarwinds the monitoring software is a piece of shit.  I won't go into it any further but it's nowhere near state of the art, and I used to complain about it and say I wanted to short it.  Well there was a huge hack of their software announced on December 12th and I got my chance.  I rode it down from 20ish to 17.50ish and got out.  I can't see them winning much new business going forward.  

This past Friday security researchers disclosed another vulnerability: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26026931   This second vuln deals with the original product (Orion) as well as some janky MFT product and it shows shows that their software is pretty poorly put together, thought out, and might have even more blind spots looming.  I thought, great, gonna short it again on Monday but someone told me ""never short a stock, only buy puts"" so I start looking into it and the stock went up big on Friday, puts near the money went down and calls near the money went up. For both Feb and March expiration.  WTH is going on?  What do market participants know that I don't know?  Well the clue is it's earnings season.  $SWI are set to release earnings on Feb 25.  So it seems kind of obvious to me that a lot of people are thinking their earnings are going to beat estimates and trying to get in on the action now.  That and general market sentiment is bullish, they are a “tech” company, etc.

So the big hack was announced around December 12th and the stock tanked that Monday the 14th.  That was 17 days before the end of the quarter.  Probably late enough and because it's the holidays, not enough to affect orders for that quarter.  So I think people are thinking that it was trading at ~20 before the (first) hack, the price dropped, but they are about to announce good financial performance in a couple of weeks here.  But that ignores the long term prospects of the company.  They have acquired a few OK technologies (Pingdom comes to mind) but their core monitoring product sucks.  Their only clients are hidebound government agencies and companies that still run on-prem stuff and mainframes.  They claim their product works well in the Cloud but it doesn’t.  The main advantage is their monitoring is agentless, which is nice but these days the cyber security guys are forcing you to bake endpoint security like Cylance, BigFix, etc into your machine images anyway so what's the big deal adding another one like DataDog or whatever?  

Anyway I'm only looking at this from the perspective of someone who has seen this POS software used at multiple jobs and literally can't believe people would still buy it (the main software which has the same name as the company).  Now granted, large IT organizations are generally run by incompetent fuck heads who never have to face the consequences of their bone headed decisions, so even terrible products continue to get used, but having serious cybersecurity vulnerabilities is often a death knell for companies like this.  In my opinion their long term business prospects are much, much worse then they have been in the last 12 months, and their stock has been as low as 12 something (the one time they missed estimated EPS in the past year).

A few theories are that they are going to play games and try to make Q4 2020 look as good as possible, then potentially trying to book as many losses as possible in Q1 2021, to get a boost so their execs can liquidate as much as possible in between.  Another theory is that they are an entrenched player in the market and even having shitty software won't stop them from selling to clueless IT execs.  Another theory is there are people anticipating another short squeeze like with GME.  There is obviously a TON of short interest due to the factors I’ve described above, and the evidence is in the “news” section of the stock quote where there are all those class action lawsuit announcements, which we all know is just games the shorters play.  But in this case the company is not demonstrating evidence that it’s on the upswing and IMO the shorters are right.

Keep in mind 1% has been the objective, but a few got away for whatever excuse I make. Just curious. Has anyone here ever had that realization moment?

I understand the call options and put options as I have been learning from few YouTube videos lately.
As weed stocks are going up I was thinking of buying a CRON $14c at a premium of 1.13.
I understand that as I go deep ITM the premium increases.So I selected a strike price of $14 with the current share price as $14.80.
Confusing part for me is how to you select the expiry date.I understand that with more time to expiry the premium increases as more implied volatility is involved.
Do you think $14c expiry 02/26 with a premium $1.13 is a wise choice?

Any suggestions are appreciated.",1,CRON call option.Suggestions please.,2.0,0.59,"CRON call option.Suggestions please. Noob here..

absloutemattness,0.0,3.0,"Hear me out, 7.6k investment into SENS gets me to 2k shares, I sell a covered call for 2 years with a strike at 7$.

The contracts sold will make me 5800$ immediately, my profit if the shares are exercised is 12200$ with the premium. 

My liability is a 1800$ investment. 

So I’m risking just that but my money the 7.6k could be tied up for 2 years. 

I’m trying to see where this can actually go wrong.

I’m fully comfortable risking my 1.8k, and I believe they’ll hit between 10-30$ within the next year or two.

This is my first sell to open covered, so I want to make sure I’m not shooting myself in the foot. What do you think about this plan?

armorrig,0.0,3.0,"Good evening fellas. Very new to options and hopefully someone can shed some light.

I'm just wondering why I am getting an Error Committing Trade when I try to sell a covered call for BB. The message states ""Underlying is a hard to borrow stock. We are not accepting this order type at this time.""

How do I go about selling a covered call for my shares?

Thank you.",1,Covered Call for BB Rejected,3.0,0.72,"Covered Call for BB Rejected Good evening fellas. Very new to options and hopefully someone can shed some light.

I was just thinking about t  which property (intrinsic value vs time value) to choose for an option for better returns? Should we be looking at a call option with more intrinsic value than time value because TV decreases as we approach the option expiry date? For a put option, will it be better if it has some intrisinc value (i.e. ITM)? Is there an ideal percentage of both to ensure healthy returns? 

Thanks guys !.",1,Intrinsic value vs Time Value for an option,3.0,0.72,"Intrinsic value vs Time Value for an option
