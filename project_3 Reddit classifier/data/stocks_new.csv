0,nivekx,0.0,0.0,"Im currently interested in investing in a ETF that follows the S&amp;P500 Ive done my fair of research and while SPY and VOO are pretty good, I use IBKR and I live outside the US, therefore IBKR charges 30% over gains (ie dividends) not capital appreciation, this is due to some US tax policy for investing in US instruments

I did a little research and found that theres another ETF that follows the S&amp;P500 called CSPX it is an accumulating ETF which basically reinvests the dividends in the stocks of the ETF and since it doesn't give you the dividends you avoid part of the 30% tax.

Im planning on holding this for a few decades and I was reading the little book of common sense investing the other day and it kinda blew my mind how over long periods of time these ""costs"" or taxes compound over time, call me a boglehead if you want but that resonated a lot.

The thing is I can't find de CSPX in IBKR I visited their page and I found its under a code name called SXR8

[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SXR8:GR](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SXR8:GR)

But I also found another ETF owned by them called CSSPX

[https://www.ishares.com/ch/individual/en/products/253743/ishares-sp-500-b-ucits-etf-acc-fund](https://www.ishares.com/ch/individual/en/products/253743/ishares-sp-500-b-ucits-etf-acc-fund)

While I found both CSSPX and SXR8 in IBKR I found on the ISHARES page the actual CSPX symbol

[https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/253743/ishares-sp-500-b-ucits-etf-acc-fund](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/253743/ishares-sp-500-b-ucits-etf-acc-fund)

So while I can find CSSPX and SXR8 (which according to IBKR is the same) I can't find the CSPX one.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any difference between all of them? CSSPX, CSPX, SXR8? Is there a better choice between the 3 of them?

San Mateo, California-based Roblox is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and gaming consoles. The reference price is not an offering price to purchase shares but rather will be a performance benchmark for when Roblox's stock starts trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers. Roblox has opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). This means the company is not selling any shares in advance of its market debut, as is the case with IPOs. Direct listings are still relatively rare, though they are becoming increasingly popular way to go public amid criticism that investment banks underwriting IPOs underprice shares being sold to help create a first-day trading ""pop"" for the benefit of their big trading clients. Reuters reported last week that U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through an IPO. Roblox said in January it had raised around $520 million in a new Series H private fundraising round in a deal which valued it at $29.5 billion, more than seven times the $4 billion the company was valued at in its Series G round 11 months earlier.

I can make a DCF model from scratch. I could talk your ear off about the different kinds of relative valuation, why certain multiples work best for different industries and the assumptions behind stuff like CAPM and WACC. Don’t need a primer on valuation itself.

What I really am wondering is this: why does this actually matter? Obviously value as a strategy has been a total disaster for the last decade, but I’m honestly not being glib. Like why, mechanically, do we expect a firm’s actual valuation to converge with its intrinsic value? What’s the point of going through this analysis? 

And why shouldn’t we just start insulting everyone that spent the past decade avoiding Amazon and Netflix because of their (tbf astronomical) forward p/e multiples?

I guess you could say that the valuation reflects the risk adjusted net present value of all future dividends and maybe the price an acquirer might pay in the future.

25,veggie-man,0.0,14.0,"iStar (STAR) is a REIT in transition moving assets to their ground leasing company called SAFE. There is a massive mispricing between the two intertwined companies.  **iStar's market cap is $1.3B yet owns $2.5B worth of SAFE** *and* **$3.1B worth of assets yielding 7.9%.** As of Q4, there was only $50M of non-performing assets. This is trading at nearly an 80% discount!

# iStar’s SAFE investment ($2.5B):

iStar created the ground leasing company SAFE in 2017,  which is a REIT that owns ground leases, not buildings.  There is already a lot written about SAFE, so I'm not going to summarize that; instead I'll focus on the mispricing. iStar owns 34.8M shares of SAFE currently valued at $2.5B ($73 / share)( [Slide 11](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008) ). Based solely on iStars SAFE holding, **iStar should trade at $34.25 a share**($2.5B of SAFE/ 74M iStar shares outstanding).

Is SAFE legit? Goldman thinks so with a recently initiated $101 price target (Jan 2021), with a street average of $90 a share. If SAFE reached Goldman’s PT, this would translate to an iStar holding of $3.5B in SAFE. Based on **Goldman’s SAFE Price target**, **iStar should trade at $47.10** a share, some 268% where it trades now.

At this point, the mispricing is so stark that **if you bought $73 of iStar** (i.e. 1 share of SAFE), you would get ***1.93 shares of SAFE***\*, plus iStar’s other underlying assets worth some $3B.\*

# iStar’s Other Assets($3.1B):

iStar breaks out their other lines of business into three buckets:

* Net Lease Consolidated Assets: $2.162B yielding 7.9% ([Slide 12](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Net Lease Venture II: 300M yielding 9% ([Slide 13](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Real Estate Finance Portfolio: $646M at 7.2% ([Slide 15](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report).

In total, they have only $52M of non-performing assets.  These assets total **$3.1B yielding 7.9%.**

# Upcoming catalysts:

I strongly feel it's a matter of time before the market realizes this massive price discrepancy. Here are some possible events:

* Goldman initiated coverage on SAFE on January 27th, 2021. Why not cover iStar if they own 63% of SAFE?
* Three major assets of iStar are Asbury Park, Magnolia Green and Grand Vista. They are looking sell these off over the next 2 years. This would be a massive cash event that could trigger a large iStar share repurchase program.
* iStar has been trying to simplify its message by selling off legacy (though high quality) assets. iStar is nearly complete with this process and plans to begin messaging this year
* SAFE x STAR One-Stop Capital Program was launched in Q4. This combines deals that allow companies to ground lease through SAFE, then allow iStar to offer financing. This could offer some additonal topline growth and further prove their business model is scalable and synergistic between iStar and SAFE going forward.

There is a lot of information already out on iStar and SAFE.  I'm a big believer in the SAFE and iStar business models, though my intention here is to highlight the massive price discrepancy between the two stocks.",stocks,"iStar (STAR): Massively undervalued, Market Mispricing REIT",14.0,0.79

So long story short, with it currently sitting pretty at $40, I find it a really attractive buy, especially given the fact that it's been close to $100 (high of $94.81). The catch is, I wanna sell my position in Twilio to fund the purchase of a butt ton $NNOX. The twilio value is double the initial investment.

My logic is, $NNOX will at least double at some point in the coming 2-3 months with FDA clearance. Therefore, I can potentially buy back into Twilio at an equal or greater amount and then use whatever I have left elsewhere.

Now I asked my father, who's taught me about stocks the most, about their opinion on this. He doesn't like the idea because he doesn't see the same outcome as I do an the probability of it occurring. His arguments primarily revolve on paying short term capital gains taxes and also the earning of Twilio. My rebuttal was that I would recoup my position shortly after the doubling of $NNOX.

36,Florida_Knight77,0.0,29.0," As everyone is well aware, the market has been a wild ride for the past couple weeks, with tech being crushed while ""re-opening"" and other value plays like energy have mostly performed well. We've seen big moves out of the airlines and cruise companies, but I personally feel that Coca-Cola is a stronger re-opening play than either of those.

KO is trading at just under $51 as of today's close, down from its pre-COVID high of $60 last year. The company was hit hard by their consumers being stuck at home for months, unable to dine out and attend sporting events or concerts. Revenue and earnings were down in 2020, and even with vaccines coming out it may still be a while until they return to 2019 levels.

With that being said, Coca-Cola took steps to re-organize their business to become more efficient in order to respond to the pandemic. I think that they can emerge from the pandemic as a more focused business, and once top-line revenues catch back up the company could really see some improvements in their earnings.

Their CEO touched on some of these aspects in their earnings call back in February:

Even with the headwinds they faced in the past year, KO still managed to increase their annual dividend to $1.64, their 39th consecutive annual increase. Of all of the so-called ""reopening plays,"" I feel like KO has not had a huge bounce due to changing investor sentiment. For example, cruise lines like Carnival are issuing new shares just to stay afloat (literally), and are months away from even being able to receive passengers. Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I'm not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I'm just surprised that more people don't seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There's a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning.

With that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (\~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I've been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.

I decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I'm not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I'm obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank 50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I'd hate to miss out on those gains.

Is KO a good re-opening play? Are there better value plays out there rn? Can tech keep running after this correction? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments. There was a lot more research that went into this one as some of the kind commenters identified gaps in my research methodology last time so I have tried to make up for it here.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.

### TL; DR

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.

2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with

3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.

4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. 

2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.

3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).

4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. 


Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

- Price = $13.45
- P/E = -12x
- EPS = -2.12 (dil)
- Forward P/E = 8.5x


# Detailed Analysis

### Bull Considerations

- $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.

- $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).

- Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes^(1) and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).

- The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of &gt; 9%).

- Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.

- Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.


### Bear Considerations

- Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.

- $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.

- $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)

- $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.

- Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.

- Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.

- Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.


### Neutral Considerations

- Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.

- Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.

- Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date^(2). Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (&lt; 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement^(3). I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.

- $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.


### Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.
  - Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025^(4).
  - Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth^(5).
  - Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026^(6).
  - Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

2. Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).
  - VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025^(7). Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
  - Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027^(8). The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres^(9).
  - Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
  - Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027^(10). However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

3. Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.
  - The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022^(11).
  - The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026^(12).
  - The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025^(13). While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

4. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. 
  - Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025^(14). However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%^(15).

5. Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.
  - The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%^(16).
  - Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually^(17).
  - Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021^(18)). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR^(19).
  - Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025^(20).

### Competitive Advantage

1. Adaptive Networking:
 - Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
 - From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&amp;T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either^(21, 22). N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
 - $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route^(23).
 - The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
 - While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&amp;T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

2. Collaboration:
 - Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
 - While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
 - Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

3. Connected Security:
 - Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
 - If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
 - Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

4. Edge Computing:
 - Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
 - As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with &lt;5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
 - An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
 - While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

5. Hybrid Cloud: 
 - Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
 - Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively^(24).
 - If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

41,BASEbelt,0.0,16.0,"TACO Earning Report released yesterday afternoon!

Put on your seatbelt and get ready for a very interesting Company Analysis on $TACO!!!

Del Taco Restaurants Inc. is an American fast-food restaurant chain that specializes in American-style Mexican cuisine as well as American foods such as tacos, burritos, fries, nachos, and shakes.

Why was Del Taco’s earning report awesome? Because the C-Suite bought back a bunch of their shares last quarter! Not to mention the C-Suite has not sold a share for over two years! These factors combined with Del Taco serving boatloads of Tacos to increasing their 2020 revenues to match their 2019 revenue levels with fewer stores opened during the pandemic!

With the $1.9 trillion relief package on the horizon and potential talks about marijuana legalization, we may be seeing a demand increase for Fast Food!

Here are the Bull case highlights from yesterdays Earning Report on TACO:

1. Earning report had an **EPS smashing analysts’ estimates by 6 cents** on a per-share basis!!!
2. Only 5.9 million shares of TACO sauce available for General Public purchase. The company repurchased 496,356 shares last quarter! **Low available shares!**
3. Fintel shows Insider ownership of 56.22% with no one selling in the past two years! C-Suite has the biggest Dimond Hands ever!!!
4. 14% short interest reported on earnings day and I predict the shorts will cover out of their positions in the next day or two as the stock is breaking their resistance levels and at its ATH price.

Now for the reason why this has a bullish future!!!

1. Based on the earning report Franchised comparable restaurant sales increased 7.5%! The company is looking to pivot with more franchisees as they bring in the revenue!
2. Del Taco is offering a new “Fresh Flex” Store design recently announced to new franchise owners. Double drive-through lanes, delivery pick-up stations, and dedicated parking lot areas for those who want to park, eat tacos, and go!
3. Del Taco is expanding into Columbus Ohio! Market exposure into Columbus = an increase in their Stores to break 600 store locations this year!
4. Analyst shows a strong buy with a price target of $12.5 on average and $15 high. Currently, there is a **low resistance barrier at $11.71** which should be passed this week!

Bear case

1. The CEO John Cappasola hasn't been very active on PR and has no Twitter to push PR out.
2. There is a low volume on the stocks and the stock has been prone to HF Shorting the stock.

TLDR: Del Taco will be increasing market shares throughout the U.S. starting this year with a new Franchise (Fresh Flex) rollout which will pivot the company and capture more market shares! This is stable stock during times of uncertainty as shown in their 2020 revenue and has a good growth projection!. Great stock to own!

This is not financial advice. I love Tacos, I love the Stock, and I believe TACO stock is extremely undervalued!

Position 75 12.5C Mar 19th (If the stock price increases quickly I will probably sell early near the 25% profit. Otherwise, I'll ride it to Mar 19th and use those earnings to buy more stocks as I believe this stock will keep on its increase projection)",stocks,Review of $TACO stock Earning Report very Bullish future!,16.0,0.8

Canoo’s last S-1 was filed almost two months ago, but I hadn’t read it until tonight. I did read the one available in August, and shared [my research](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/j6u367/canoo_is_on_to_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in October.

After wrapping my mind around the subtle, positive changes in messaging in their latest filing, and the [impending premiere of Canoo's newest vehicle](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/m0og3t/canoogoev_pickup_truck_world_premiere_march_11th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I'm considering what may be the most interesting question the company has forced us to ponder in months:

When did the pick-up truck become the next thing?

We’ve seen it in a few renderings, and [Tony mentioned it was coming back in December](https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-canoo/canoo-reveals-electric-delivery-van-plans-for-pickup-microfactories-idUSKBN28R21Q), but it hasn’t ever been included on their roll-out schedule.

That order has always been:

* Consumer Van (short-term lease/subscription, 2022)
* B2B/MPDV (sales, 2023)
* Sedan (short-term lease/subscription, 2024 or 25)

And that’s how it was reflected [in the company’s latest prospectus](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-001996/fs12021_canooinc.htm), which was published in early January. It discusses (as it did in August), the three offerings listed above in meaningful detail, but never mentions the truck. [It wasn’t discussed in the investor presentation either](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_75917b64e8f13bc03dbc9e3230eeade6/canoo/db/1087/9680/pdf/HCAC+Canoo+-+Investor+Presentation+-+FINAL.pdf).

Which made me wonder:

* Why is the truck being revealed before the sedan?
* Is it going to be *released* before the sedan?
* If so, why the change? Was it due to a commercial order?
* Or is it simply because they believe they’ll move more units across segments with two vans (B2C and MPVD) and a truck than they could with a sedan in it’s place?

The reality is, we won’t know the answer to any of those questions until the event wraps up on Thursday (at the earliest), but it's fun to think about, and based on the conclusions I'm drawing while going through this exercise, I suspect we’ll end up appreciating at least a few of the answers that eventually come our way.

———

Here are a few quotes from the S-1 that add credibility to the notion that this truck roll-out could be the result of a pressing market opportunity that Canoo recently decided to take advantage of:

“We are actively exploring \[new\] market opportunities and will continue to carefully assess and pursue \[them\] as they become available.”

and

“In addition to this current planned vehicle lineup, we have evaluated and continue to evaluate the consumer and commercial vehicle markets, including projected trends and developments, to identify new areas of demand and product opportunities. Our skateboard platform uniquely positions us to efficiently allocate capital to meet current and evolving demand and margin opportunities by allowing us to quickly adjust volumes and add new product derivatives.”

———

And here are a handful of statements from the latest S-1, that produce questions we're all looking forward to gaining answers to:

* “We are \[currently\] in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging our technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” Who?
* “We are in advanced discussions with several parties regarding the licensing of our skateboard and other technology.” Who and what other technology?
* “Our skateboard platform and our steer-by-wire and centralized computing architecture make us uniquely positioned to take advantage of continuing advancements in autonomous vehicle technology. We are in discussions with some of the most prominent companies pursuing this technology.” Who?
* “We are also in discussions with a number of other partners and expect to be in a position to announce many more partnerships in due course.” Who and when?
* “We and a potential contract manufacturing partner have been working together on vehicle designs for manufacturability and production planning since early 2018.” Still focused on contract manufacturing in most current S-1, but Tony mentioned micro-factories in December. How do they plan to scale production?",stocks,What can we read into GOEV/Canoo’s upcoming truck reveal?,14.0,0.86

51,psychotrader00,0.0,257.0,"After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. 

The Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Courtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, “This is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you’re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don’t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?”

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire.

52,EchoFreeMedia,0.0,20.0,"Hi all. I have seen some great posts here and I wanted to share some due diligence I have done over the last 24 hours on Avangrid, Inc. (AVG), which I think is poised for a move upward. This is just my personal musing and should not be interpreted, taken, or inferred as financial advice. Full disclosure: I own two March 19, 2021 50 calls and I am considering purchasing shares and more calls.

TL;DR - AGR is one of the larger energy companies in the US, recently received a long awaited environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (""BOEM"") as to its massive offshore wind farm, and appears to have support of the Biden administration. The company and its stock could be poised for growth and upward movement.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first learned of this company yesterday while researching the Biden administration's timeline for green energy projects. While doing said research, I came across press releases and news on AGR. The BOEM has finally released the environmental impact statements as to the Vineyard Wind 1 project. It seems that it was being held up by the Trump administration for political reasons. Here is some information from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005701/en/AVANGRID-Offshore-Wind-Joint-Venture-Vineyard-Wind-1-Achieves-Key-Regulatory-Milestone):

&gt; ""AVANGRID, Inc. (NYSE: AGR) confirmed today that the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Vineyard Wind 1. The issuance of the FEIS is the final step before a Record of Decision (ROD) from BOEM, the last approval required for construction on the project to begin. The project is under development by Vineyard Wind, a joint venture between Avangrid Renewables, a subsidiary of AVANGRID, Inc., and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP).""  
&gt;  
&gt;""With the issuance of the FEIS, Vineyard Wind confirmed that the project remains on track to reach financial close in the second half of 2021 and begin delivering clean energy to Massachusetts in 2023.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Located 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, Vineyard Wind 1 is slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the United States. With a generating capacity of 800 megawatts (MW), the project will provide enough electricity to power more than 400,000 homes and businesses in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...""

It seems like AGR has plans to build other offshore wind farms:

&gt;""In addition to Vineyard Wind 1, Avangrid Renewables is a partner on Park City Wind, an 800 MW project to serve the state of Connecticut, as well as on additional lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island to deliver up to 3,500 MW. Avangrid Renewables also is developing Kitty Hawk Offshore Wind that has the potential to deliver 2,500 MW of clean energy into Virginia and North Carolina.""

There is also AGR's acquisition of PNM. AGR has recently been [moving to purchase](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210212005493/en/PNM-Resources-Shareholders-Approve-Proposed-AVANGRID-Merger) a large energy producer in New Mexico. I will not hazard a guess as to how this will affects the share price, but according to the above article:

&gt;""AVANGRID announced the strategic PNM Resources merger combination in October 2020 in an all cash offer for PNM Resources’ shares at $50.30 per share, an $8.3 billion enterprise value transaction. The resulting entity would be one of the major clean energy companies in the US with ten regulated utilities in six states and the third largest renewables company with operations in 24 states.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Approval by PNM’s shareholders is an important step toward realizing this strategic transaction. Our two companies share the same values and we are passionate about our customers, employees, and the communities we serve,' said Dennis V. Arriola, CEO of AVANGRID.""

Some of the financial data I pulled from Nasdaq today:

\*\*P/E Ratio\*\*25.7

\*\*Forward P/E 1 Yr.\*\*21.33

\*\*Earnings Per Share(EPS)\*\*$1.88

\*\*Annualized Dividend\*\*$1.76

Thus, unlike a lot of typical green energy growth stock, AGR is already profitable and pays a dividend.

According the head of the National Ocean Industries Association President quoted in this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/03/08/biden-climate-windfarm/), it seems like offshore wind could end up being a huge area, with the potential for $160 billion worth of investments over the next fifteen years:

&gt;""Monday’s announcement drew praise from industry. National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito said it was “critical for the project developers and for the offshore wind industry as a whole.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Milito called on the administration to move even faster, noting that it has been two years since the last federal offshore wind lease sale. He noted that a recent analysis suggested near-term lease opportunities could generate more than $160 billion in new investment over the next 15 years, but that Interior’s Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management “must first open the door to new leasing.”

I like the dividend, the potential for growth, and the alignment with the current political climate. I am mulling whether to buy shares in addition to trading the options. The one concern for me as a long-term investment, however, is that the P/E ratio is still a little high for my taste. I generally avoid ""growth stocks"" in my investment portfolio. I am on the fence.

71,qwerty5151,0.0,19.0,"I've been seeing conflicting descriptions of what happens with wash sales recently and thought it would be good for this community to clarify what happens in different situations.

It seems like everyone understands that if you buy a stock 30 days after selling for a loss, that loss isn't deductible. However, there seems to be confusion over the tax implications of subsequent actions. 

Let's say you originally buy 100 shares of a stock at $100. You then sell those shares at $80, for a $2000 loss. If you rebuy within 30 days, I think most people understand that the $2000 loss is not deductible and instead gets added to your cost basis.

Let's say you rebuy 100 shares within 30 days at a price of $70. Your cost basis should now be $7000 + $2000 = $9000.

Now, let's say the stock drops again and you sell at $60. This is where there seems to be confusion about what is deductible.

My understanding is that the new loss would be $6000 - $9000 = $3000, due to the increased cost basis. 

***QUESTION 1***: Is this $3000 loss is deductible, despite the original wash sale? 

I've been assuming yes, but I see a lot of people that suggest it isn't deductible. Is it correct that deductible losses are always determined from the cost basis at the most recent sale (ignoring long-term vs short-term issues)? I keep seeing people say that the deduction cannot include losses from previous wash sales, but if that is true, why would the wash sale increase the cost basis? I thought that was the point of the increased cost basis.

There are horror stories of people making $200k in taxable gains that they lost entirely through wash sales, making them owe taxes on the $200k despite losing it all. Couldn't that only occur if a wash sale occurred within 30 days of a new year, or if they never closed their position after a wash sale? As long as you sold before the new year and didn't rebuy, this couldn't happen, could it?

***QUESTION 2:*** Is a wash sale a reason to never rebuy a stock within 30 days?

I've frequently see people say ""I sold at a loss, so I have to wait 30 days to buy back in otherwise I can't deduct the loss."" Isn't this true only if they don't resell that same year, or if they create another wash sale in January? Basically, I'm seeing people wait to get back in on a rising stock simply because it is within 30 days. If you want to be be able to deduct the current loss within this tax year, then sure, that makes sense to wait. However, if you don't mind risking pushing that deduction to a later time, doesn't it make much more sense to buy back in if you think the stock will continue rising? I'm basically seeing people deciding to not rebuy a stock because they are afraid they won't ever be able to deduct a loss.

**QUESTION 3:** Ignoring long-term vs short-term gains/losses, can't you always *eventually* deduct an equivalent amount regardless of wash sales? 

Basically, because the cost basis gets adjusted with wash sales, aren't those losses always included when you close your position, either resulting in decreased profits, or increased losses. If so, is there anything critical missing in the suggestion: ""don't rebuy within 30 days if you want to deduct the loss within the current year."" I understand that tax-loss harvesting strategies can be complex, but many of the explanations I've seen for wash sales seem inaccurate.",stocks,Common Wash Sale Confusions,19.0,0.93
72,Dr_Pips_Rips_Dips,0.0,1.0,"Hey Traders, 

Today I'm writing about one of my favorite secondary indicators, Volume Profile Visible Range (""VPVR"").  What I mean by a ""secondary indicator"" is that I generally do not trade solely based off of the VPVR. When I decide to put on a trade, frequently off some of the prior indicators and techniques I have introduced (moving averages, RSI, Stochs, historical horizontal support/resistance), I will then look at the VPVR to see if there is any further confluence with the indicator. If the VPVR lines up nicely with some of the other things I'm seeing I will then adjust my risk appetite or confidence for the trade. That being said I have met some good traders who use the VPVR as one of their primary indicators along with historical support/resistance levels. VPVR can be quite effective on it's own for certain trading styles.  

**Background Info**

VPVR comes from a family of visible volume profile indicators that essentially display the volume done at various price levels on an asset along the right side of the chart, thereby enabling a technical trader to quickly identify the highest volume nodes at specific price levels. This allows a trader to identify price levels that have heightened significance because of the substantial volume done at these levels. 

I prefer VPVR over the Fixed Range and Session Volume visible ranges because it allows me to move my charts around more freely without having to adjust the inputs on the indicator. VPVR will basically spit out the visible volume node data for whatever price action you currently have on your screen. 

See this 1 Day chart of S&amp;P 500 Futures to get a quick introduction to VPVR: [https://imgur.com/gallery/M8DUSmo](https://imgur.com/gallery/M8DUSmo)

**Why do High Volume Nodes (""HVN"") matter?**

These high volume nodes (""HVN"") carry significance in markets because they are areas where a lot of price action and price discovery has occurred. If price holds above a HVN it can be generally interpreted as market consensus that the asset should hold its currently levels and possibly move higher. The opposite applies when price breaks through a HVN. This concept ties into and is closely related to why historical support/resistance levels are significant. Distilled to its simplest terms,  HVN's are levels where sophisticated market participants and algorithms have put on positions and they will generally defend their positions with more buying/selling, however when these levels are broken they will be very quick to flip to the opposing buy/sell side in accordance with their risk management guidelines.  As a result,  a lot of explosive price action can happen around these HVN's, either as a bounce, rejection, or break through. 

**The Point of Control!**

This concept is further amplified when you come to the Point of Control (""PoC""), because it is THE HIIGHEST VOLUME NODE. The market participation, active positions from that level, and significance to overall trend when looking at higher time frame charts (1d, 3d, 1w) is further heightened for the PoC. The PoC is a great spot to look for potential bounces on price action and also for quick and sudden reversals in trend when broken. 

**VPVR as a Secondary Indicator**

Here is a little demo of how I frequently use the VPVR as one of my main secondary indicators: [https://imgur.com/gallery/ejXBDZd](https://imgur.com/gallery/ejXBDZd)

A trader could then add to their long positions at relevant levels on the way up. 

Conversely, if oscillators and price action are looking pretty bearish and a trader thinks the previously identified liquidity zone might break this time, VPVR could be used as follows: [https://imgur.com/gallery/cz3jWdl](https://imgur.com/gallery/cz3jWdl)

In the example above you will notice that I am using the VPVR in confluence with exponential moving averages (""ema's"") AND historical horizontal support/resistance levels. I find that the VPVR truly becomes powerful and effective for my personal trading style when used in conjunction with these other indicators. 

Another great tool to use in confluence with the VPVR are Fibonacci retracement/extension levels. When a HVN or the PoC lines up with a critical fibonacci level it is another ""confidence booster' for me when trading.  Fibonacci retracements will be one of the next installments in the TA series so stay tuned if you want to learn more about fibs!

**The Danger of Low Value Nodes (""LVN"")**

As previously explained herein, HVN's have significance in the market because that is where a lot of prior price action has taken place so there will be many market participants interested in those areas. Conversely, LVN's act as a vacuum or air pocket where price will absolutely rip through because there is not a lot of price history or market participation at those levels. So, when I see HVN's getting increasingly sparse underneath an asset as it continues to go up I take that as a ""watch tf out"" warning sign, because when the asset reverses it has the potential to do so in a very nasty way.

See this 1D chart of MDB to see the significance of LVN's: [https://imgur.com/gallery/kcbm21M](https://imgur.com/gallery/kcbm21M)

Why am I buying this stock?

This company is killing it financially. Revenue growth has been growing from 126M to 158M 2018-2019 and has increased since then. The profit margin is crazy with 65M on 160M revenue, which leaves 15M a year to R&amp;D. The best growth companies always operate at a loss to pump money back into the company. Even still, they turned 5.21M in Net Income.

UCL is a fairly new company that recently flopped it's IPO, which looks like an excellent buying opportunity. They are continuing to grow in Asia and have recently expanded their footprint in the North America with new partners in the US and Canada. 

They have a huge opportunity to grow, with not a lot of room to go down based on financials and growth alone.

While BB is still on their watch list (you can see this from [https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/) chart he posted), I don't believe they are following each other due to the lack of volume BB has.

**Apple Inc** [AAPL 3.52%](https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ) [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-tv-plus-announces-programming-partnership-with-nobel-laureate-malala-yousafzai/) a multi-year partnership with the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Malala Yousafzai.

**What Happened:** Apple announced on Monday its plan to add the 23-year-old women’s rights activist’s production company, Extracurricular, to its streaming service.

Yousafzai’s content will include original dramas, comedies, documentaries, animation and children’s series.

Yousafzai, who has published three books for both adults and children, is also the creator of an online digital publication, Assembly, which has published stories from girls and young women in more than 100 countries, according to Apple’s blog.

Yousafzai will use her Apple TV+ platform to “bring families together, forge friendships, build movements and inspire children to dream,” said Yousafzai. “And I couldn’t ask for a better partner than Apple to help bring these stories to life. I’m grateful for the opportunity to support women, young people, writers and artists in reflecting the world as they see it.”

**Why It Matters:** Yousafzai will join a lineup of other well-known figures on Apple TV+ such as Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Idris Elba as the streaming service seeks to add educational content to its roster and expand outside the entertainment genre in a further effort to compete with **Netflix Inc** [NFLX 3.08%](https://benzinga.com/stock/nflx#NASDAQ), **Roku Inc** [ROKU 8.01%](https://benzinga.com/stock/roku#NASDAQ) and **Walt Disney Co.** [DIS 2.26%](https://benzinga.com/stock/dis#NYSE).

**What’s More:** On Oct. 9, 2012, [Yousafzai](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai#:~:text=Malala%20Yousafzai%20(born%20July%2012,%201997)%20is%20a,person%20to%20have%20won%20the%20Nobel%20Peace%20Prize.) was shot in the head by a masked Taliban gunman in retaliation for her activism. After recovering in Birmingham, England, Yousafzai began advocating for the right to education and has since toured the world speaking to audiences at the United Nations, Harvard University and the Oxford Union.

Yousafzai graduated from Oxford University last year and has received dozens of national and international awards, as well as honors for her work to support women and children.

Yousafzai also started the [Malala Fund](https://www.malala.org/) to support girls getting a safe, free and quality 12-year education. 

Although Apple and Yousafzai have partnered together before on a number of products to support women and children, “The partnership has since expanded, and in Brazil, Apple’s 10 Developer Academies have partnered with Malala Fund to advance girls’ education opportunities there and around the world,” Apple said in the release.",stocks,Apple TV+ Partners With Women's Rights Activist Malala Yousafzai $AAPL,1.0,0.55

**Apple Inc’s** [AAPL 3.53%](https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ) smartphones are set to get camera upgrades in 2022 and 2023 that will make them more robust and increase their shooting capability, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, AppleInsider [reported](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/09/kuo-unibody-lens-coming-to-iphone-in-2022-periscope-lens-in-2023) Tuesday.

**What Happened:** The iPhone will come with a “unibody” design in 2022 which will integrate the voice coil motor of its camera and the lens array, according to Kuo.

This move could free up internal space in the device and increase the robustness of the smartphone made by the Tim Cook-led company, according to AppleInsider.

Apple plans to add a telephoto camera on its high-end iPhones from a 6P lens array to a 7P stack in 2022 as well. 

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is reportedly planning to move all its rear-facing iPhone lenses to the 7P stack in the coming years. 

The analyst said that, in 2023, Apple will introduce a telephoto lens design to the iPhone. This type of design helps to extend the focal length of a compact lens array, as per AppleInsider.

**Why It Matters:** Kuo had previously made the prediction regarding the telephoto lens design and given a timeline of 2022.

According to Kuo, Apple will also fine-tune iPhone’s optics this year and make the move from glass to plastic cover materials for Face ID.

The company also plans to add a new telephoto lens to its high-end models which will come with a 6P lens stack, an improvement from the 5P design found currently, as per Kuo.

Long on SABR, the IT backend with full exposure to travel industry recovery. Revenue closely correlates with traveler count. Stock is poised for a short squeeze with 20% short interest.

\---

With the USA vaccine plan in full swing and the estimates of enough vaccines for all adults by May, travel stonks had a huge boost in confidence. With the summer travel season coming in hot, people are flocking to all kinds of travel stocks: airlines, cruises, hotels, casinos, etc. One that has been flying under the radar is $SABR, the Global Distribution System IT backend that services ALL these industries and benefits directly from increased travel numbers. As travel increases, their revenue directly correlates. In a nutshell, I like this stock for multiple reasons, including a position unique to SABR: a 20% short interest. As the population with immunization increases, pent up travel demand should cause a huge influx of leisure travel. IMO, I think the amount of leisure travel will exceed 2019’s as the world opens back up. Also, SABR is a better reopening play than airliners because business travel loss does not affect them as much.

# What is Sabre Technology?

Market Cap: 4.776B

Total Share Float: 317M

Institutional Ownership: 105% (yep, that’s higher than the float)

Sabre provides the infrastructure that allows major ticketing and booking sites to operate. They provide the data that allows sites like Expedia and Google Travel, and many others to operate. Their customer base includes:

· Expedia: Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com, Tripadvisor.com, SeatGuru.com, Cheaptickets.com

· Booking: Kayak, Agoda, Priceline, CheapFlights, Momondo, OpenTable, RentalCars

· Google Flights and Hotels

· Hilton Worldwide

· Marriot

· Hyatt Hotels

· Caesars Entertainment

Essentially, they cover 35% market share of all travel booking transactions. Competitors include Travelport (not public), and Amadeus (mainly European travel). So, if you want a “picks and shovels” company with heavy exposure to the Northern Hemisphere’s travel industry, this would fit the bill. Another fantastic move they made at the start of 2020 was partnering with Google Cloud to create an AI driven solution that should create more value for their clients, while reducing overhead. The Sabre Travel AI development will be launching this year and bodes well for the technical moat that they are building. The fruits of this partnership should manifest in the coming years.

# Recovery Projections

Due to the close correlation between travelers and Sabre’s revenue, I took the liberty of modeling out the two datasets of Price and Travelers relative to each other.

[https://i.imgur.com/jJbmNRa.png](https://i.imgur.com/jJbmNRa.png[/img])

The correlation is relatively strong, and even demonstrate a breakout in speculation in the recent months due to positive vaccine news. As the number of travelers increase, a reversion to the mean should continue to carry the stock price upwards. I’m pretty bullish on the trend and think there’s plenty of upside to go in Q2 and Q3 of 2021. My price target is **$22** by end of year.

# But What about Business Travel?

The amount of total business travelers is expected to drop in the coming years as people realize they can sit in their bedroom on Zoom and not even put on pants while working. This is true, and SABR is pretty well positioned to handle it. Business travelers account for 12% of airlines’ passengers but drive more profit due to memberships and amenities. In some cases, they represent 75% of certain airlines’ revenues. So decreased business travel is absolutely brutal to airline companies. However, even if 12% of travelers never come back, SABR can shrug it off. Because their revenue correlates with **QUANTITY of travelers** **and not quality.** Looking at the above graph, even at a sustained average of 2M travelers, SABR share price should be trading around $20. For this reason, SABR is a better reopening play than airliners.

# Short Interest of 20%

For reasons that still elude me, Sabre has a relatively high short interest that continue to pile up, despite many signs of recovery. There are currently **61.3M shares sold short, with a total float of 317M.** Considering the daily volume of **\~6M**, we are looking at a situation where shorts will take **10 days to cover the entire position.** The smaller the daily volume, the more difficult it is for shorts to cover their position without causing a spike in price. This means that **SABR** **is poised for a short squeeze**. It may not happen violently like what we saw in some other meme stocks, but at the very least, it may cause natural buying pressure over time as the shorts unwind.

# Bear Case

The risk factors include:

· New debt from 2020 debt offerings and refinancing

· Share dilutions in the amount of \~$500 million

· $4.74B of long term debt (64.85M is current debt, which is easily covered with $1.5B in cash reserves)

· Delay in travel reopening, or more crazy COVID news

· Lower than expected travelers returning. Business travel is expected to decrease, but it impacts SABR far less than airliners.

Ultimately, this is a bet on the travel reopening. This is not financial advice, etc. Do your own due diligence and come to your own decision on what to do here. If you have issues with the DD, please poke some holes in it and let me know your bear case.

They know that it's not necessarily the build of their hardware that sells, but the characters. There are tons of collectors of Nintendo merch -- seriously, people will buy anything with Mario on it. Nintendo was giving out some special edition enamel pins for Mario's 35th birthday and they are being scalped on [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Super-Mario-Bros-35th-Anniversary-Pin-Set-2-Two-Wave-2-IN-HAND-RARE/164715041059?chn=ps&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;itemid=164715041059&amp;targetid=1068323850710&amp;device=m&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9061081&amp;campaignid=11612432397&amp;mkgroupid=114834375322&amp;rlsatarget=pla-1068323850710&amp;abcId=9300456&amp;merchantid=6296724&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5eCBhCBARIsAEhk4r4RbOf4yLUdgHB7J7Ixu2JsDsAEIbRG5hSjWBj3B8bgIJz6UsjD61MaAjnBEALw_wcB&amp;pageci=5b3660be-2c5a-4a93-90cd-4259139ee94e) for crazy amounts. With Super Nintendo World opening soon in Japan then (eventually) in Florida and California, I see them as kind of the Disney of gaming.

Since the pandemic, their sales have been through the roof. Animal Crossing released at almost the perfect time for an open ended game and became a ""console seller"" game. The Switch has been an innovation due to its portability, and since they release their next gen consoles on a different schedule than Xbox and Playstation, they don't compete directly with them on hardware releases. Many people who have an Xbox or Playstation also have a Switch which puts Nintendo in a class of its own. I don't think many people have all three.

Right now, NTDOY has dropped to about $68 a share from an all time high of low 80s. I don't know how to determine if it is accurately priced but I will likely pick up a few during this dip. Wondering what other people think about Nintendo as an investment.",stocks,Thoughts about NTDOY,35.0,0.9

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I started buying around $64 a share, kept buying into the high 80s, also own a bunch of ITM and OTM calls for 2022/2023, recently started selling ATM naked puts for those dates as well.  It's my 3rd largest position after Apple and Google.  My post isn't to pump the stock, I'd love for it to keep going lower so I can keep buying more LEAPS, but I'd love to hear some arguments as to why my thesis is wrong so I can have some differing viewpoints.

Buying Sony today to me feels like buying Apple in 2013.  ""No revenue growth, one trick pony, no innovation, etc.""  This is what they used to say about Apple in 2013.  I disagreed and plowed 80% of my net worth into Apple.  At the time, Apple was trading between 11-13 PE.  That seemed extremely cheap to me for a company that is part of a duopoly on a product that people are addicted to and will stare at for 8+ hours a day.  

Sony is currently trading near a 12-13 PE with close to 45b cash on hand and barely any debt. Ex cash they are trading under a 10 PE.  They haven't had much revenue growth the past years, but I expect that to change being at the beginning of a new console cycle. They are killing earnings and you can't even find the PS5 in store. They makes a device that people are addicted to. Like Apple, they get a 30% cut off the software that other people make to run on their device. They are part of a duopoly/triopoly and are the dominant player.

Sony is much more than just Playstation.  Their company is hitting on all cylinders in movies, music, image sensors, etc, but I focus on gaming because that's where I see the real potential.  If Playstation was its own entity trading on the Nasdaq, would it not garner at least a $200 billion valuation?  10x sales is not that much for a company growing at the clip that PS network services has been the last few years.  And yet here we are, with Sony's total valuation ex cash sitting at 50% of that.

Gaming is still in its infancy.  NES in 1985 was the first time gaming became mainstream. Investing in gaming now is akin to investing in Ford in the 1950s.  Sony's biggest mistake was not selling the PS5 for $699 because it's clear that many people will pay that, but I still think they are setup very well for the future.  I would pay 127B market cap for Playstation division alone, everything else that Sony produces is just icing on the cake.  

Change my mind.  Tell me why I'm wrong on Sony.  I don't expect them to be as big as Apple, but I don't think a 300-500b market cap is unreasonable if they continue growing gaming earnings at the current pace.",stocks,Sony is one of the most undervalued stocks in the entire market.

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

I'm just getting comfortable with selling covered calls, particularly on $F, &amp; was wondering if this actually, despite being an options trade, could reduce volatility for one's account value (at least in some cases). 

In particular, I sold 7x 4/9 14c. Ford's been more volatile in the last few months than historically, I believe, but this trade &amp; the strategy in general don't strike me as particularly risky. Ford being Ford, I can't imagine it breaking $15.50 (a 22% gain from today's close in 4 weeks) without some huge news. So while I'm limited on upside, it's likely minimal, and this acts as a hedge on declines as well. If I have to sell out of my position, I expect it'll be near the expiry date &amp; so I'll be able to re-enter, having made a solid gain.

Please let me know if there's anything I'm missing with the above logic.

After watching the madness happen in Texas, the power outages, bursting pipes and more (hope everyone in TX is doing better! &lt;3 ). It got me thinking about America’s overall infrastructure problems and the failed promises from different Presidential administrations over the years.

Here’s what I’m thinkin:

Rolling blackouts in Texas makes the rest of the country take a second-look at their power grids and deeper into overall infrastructure. There is a new political push to update America’s outdated infrastructure after decades of neglect (https://infrastructurereportcard.org/). This also has potential to create new jobs and help recover from COVID’s impact. It’s really such a win-win idea to help our country in an area we desperately need an overhaul. IMO the only thing holding work like this back is ‘politics’.

Biden and Democrats would love to pass legislation like this while they have a majority. Even Trump wanted to get infrastructure work done, so there would/could/should be support from some Republicans as well. Pete Buttigieg is a young-gun in the Democratic party, has shown willingness to tackle big challenges - he would love to get his name attached to a large and historical infrastructure bill. IMO, one thing holding it back is the GOP not wanting to let the Democrats get a ‘win’ by passing (more) historic legislation. 

https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-us-infrastructure

‘from roads and bridges to freight rail and ports to electrical grids and internet provision. But the systems currently in place were built decades ago, and economists say that delays and rising maintenance costs are holding economic performance back.’

(from Trend Trading for Dummies by Barry Burns)

Imagine a futuristic TV game show where you're sitting at home in front of your TV, watching a bus driving down the city streets The bus is packed with people yelling at the driver trying to tell him which way to go next Your job is to predict where the bus is going and type your predictions into a computer one block before the bus gets there.

Is it an impossible task? Almost! But some things could make it easier. Some events could put the odds on your side — even if just for a moment.

For example, if the driver stopped at a traffic light in the right lane and had his right-turn signal blinking, that would be a reasonable indicator that the bus is about to turn right You could type into your computer that the bus will turn right here and go on at least to the next cross street.

Of course, the bus driver could go straight anyway (ever been behind a driver who's had his turn signal on for blocks without turning?), but the odds are that when people activate their turn signal, they turn in the direction of that signal.

If the driver is crossing an intersection and you can see up ahead that the traffic light at the next intersection is yellow and about to turn red, you could type into your computer that the bus will stop at the next light. Will you be correct? The driver could speed right through the red light without stopping, and that does happen occasionally, but the odds are that the bus will stop at the next light. Even a police car with sirens blaring will slow down at red lights.

If the bus is speeding north (the direction or trend of the car) on the street at 65 miles per hour (the speed or momentum of the car), the odds are against it being able to stop on a dime at the next intersection. It's pretty safe to say that it would be an exception to the rule and not the driver's intention to stop that soon.

This example illustrates how strong momentum puts the odds on your side that the trend will continue. In trading, if you get into a trend that has strong momentum behind it, you have a high-probability trade that the trend will continue after you enter your position instead of coming to an end immediately after you place your trade.",stocks,Cool Explanation of How Momentum Investing Works,9.0,0.84

164,Miladyboi,0.0,25.0,"First, I would like to start this off by saying I don't care about the short term outcome of the markets I just like to talk about it and try to predict it for fun in my boring ass life. Anyways, I truly believe that at least for tomorrow we're going to have a true bounce based on what people think are good deals and not just a dead cat one. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first reason, one pattern I was noticing among a lot of stocks like TSLA, AMD, APPL, and a bunch more were that there were a lot of the little spikes in the ah chart. I think that means it's when institutional investors buy big portions and usually when this would happen I wouldn't bat a second eye but today it seemed like it was happening with so many stocks and not just once but multiple times across nearly all of tech.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, although futures aren't an accurate prediction of what's going to happen tomorrow, they're all up big, and for the first time in a few weeks were back to normal where the Nasdaq is leading and although I know it's because it fell much more it's still a promising sight to see as other times futures were up the dow and SMP still led. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, although I could be completely wrong about this and it's juts a hunch, the Nasdaq is down around 10% on the dot, the correction I have been comparing this the most to is mainly the one in October, where much like this one tech was heavily beat down although for slightly different reasons. Anyway, in October when the Nasdaq was down around 10.6% that is when a true recovery had begun to happen, and although this could be something completely different, I believe that is another promising sign.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, it's that nothing can repeat forever. The thing I'm trying to say here is that every single morning we wake up, see the Nasdaq up, met by rapid selling. But can this really continue? I understand it technically could but then wouldn't everyone just short it in the morning for easy money, and because I personally believe there is no such thing as ""easy money"" there had to be a point where the Nasdaq holds strong and the suits simply decide to just buy back into tech. 

Additionally, are we not gonna talk about how fucking extended these recovery plays are. Just a heads up I own BA and JPM which in my mind no way BA is overvalued while JPM could be but I believe with how this recovery is going and with Powell promising interest rates to stay low they're probably safe but what the fuck is going on with UAL, DAL, and all the other airlines. Some of these airlines are close to break even when we all know the travel industry especially along business is going to change forever and their revenues are still down big with the prospects that in 2-3 years they would be back to where they started. Also, don't even get me started on hotels and oil. Anyway, what I'm saying is that at what point to people start taking a profit of the recovery plays and actually start rotating back again to tech. I understand it may not happen this fast but you never know.

167,idrthrb,0.0,11.0,"**My Take on FTHM:** **Fathom Realty**

I am posting about this ticker because I love this company. First, I am not a financial advisor, just a Real Estate Agent who is very proud of their organization. As a Fathom Agent, I have received stock from the company and I have also purchased stock on my own outside of those grants because I believe in the product so much.

On to the information:

First, this is a 5.13mm float stock that moves quickly, so beware. It was an IPO that launched on 7/30/2020.

Also, this stock has EARNINGS on 3/10/2021. 

As far as when they will be profitable, a 2/10/21 article by Simply Wall St projected that FTHM will be profitable by 2023 at their current rate of growth. Again, not an expert so that is why I am posting that.

**Why agents are moving to Fathom over major brokerages:** 

1: They pay significantly less commission with Fathom than the other Major Brokers

2: The Fathom proprietary technology, IntelliAgent, saves agents time and money and makes it easier to get paid faster.

3: Free CRM Program for Agents

4: Stock Incentive

**In Depth Detail:**

1: Simple enough, Fathom has one of the best opportunities for agents in the market when it comes to KEEPING their own commission. At a brokerage like Keller Williams, you are expected to pay 20% to 30% of your commission on each sale to the brokerage. On a $300,000 sale at 3% commission, that comes out to $1,800 (@ 20%) or $2,700 (@ 30%) of your $9,000 commission. These brokerages also have desk/monthly/errors and omission (e&amp;o) fees that are $25+ a month. At a certain amount of total commission paid, some brokerages “cap” the agent and they then get to keep 100% of commission. I have seen this be anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 (this will vary by market).

With Fathom, an agent only pays a one-time yearly fee of $500 (it comes out of the first commission check), and then $450 per transaction up to 12 sales. Then they pay $99 a transaction afterwards. A Fathom agent pays a total of $5,900 before they cap, then $99 afterwards for every transaction.  This is simply a PHENOMINAL deal for the agent.

I reviewed a number of other agencies like Fathom where you keep 100% of your commission and pay a transaction fee. I did not find one that beat Fathom. The closest second was Realty One. I really liked their offering as well but their costs with monthly fees and transaction fees were double what Fathom was.

The only way I could figure out how to keep more of my commission was to open my own brokerage, which has significantly more liability.

2: Fathom OWNS a program called IntelliAgent which every agent they have today uses to submit their paperwork and to obtain funding on their transactions. An agent uploads certain documents to the program in order for their district manager to review for compliance. While this sounds simple, it has been a nightmare in the industry finding something that works across different states with different requirements per transaction. Fathom has navigated this hurdle and IntelliAgent makes it easy for the Agent to get paid. I can speak personally that before I worked for Fathom I had to hire a Transaction Coordinator for each sale I made ($300+ per transaction) just to move the paperwork through my old brokerage. With Fathom I have never needed any assistance because IntelliAgent works so well. This will be a KEY factor in how they scale up from the 27 states they are in today.

3: Right now Fathom gives all their agents KV Core, which is a CRM /Marketing platform for agents to use to help run their business and customer drips. It is the same program a number of real estate companies use (I believe EXP uses KV Core). It is a VERY good program. But they do not OWN the program and I am sure they pay a hefty sum to offer this as part of their package.

On 3/2/2021 Fathom closed a deal to purchase a company called Naberly Solutions. With Naberly, Fathom will have the last piece of the puzzle they did not own; their own proprietary CRM software. By owning the software, Fathom will reduce their costs as they no longer will be paying for KV Core for agents and differentiate themselves from other brokerages. Owning their CRM should also be a major plus for investors. This will be a savings for Fathom once it is rolled out to their agents. I have not seen a timeline announced for that at this time.

4: One final reason agents are moving to Fathom is because of the stock program. Right now, seasoned agents are being given stock grants for joining Fathom. Agents who qualify are being offered $200 per transaction they had the year prior to joining Fathom, up to $6000 in grants. These grants come with a three-year vesting schedule which will help keep agents with the company. A lot of the original agents received their stock grants at $10.00 per share when the company had their IPO last year. The stock is currently selling over $30.00 and was over $50.00 before the market downturn the past few weeks. Fathom also launched a program to incentivize current agents to recruit new agents. Agents also get stock grants for each transaction they complete.

A lot of brokerages have an additional hook to get agents to recruit, but if you look more into them it is more of a pyramid scheme than an incentive program. No one has a program like Fathom is offering with their stock grants. I also believe the upside on the stock is significant and many agents moving over see the potential as well.

So if everything is cheap and the agent is getting such a great deal, how does Fathom make money? They do so by scaling the business. For the past six years they have been on the INC 500/5000 Fastest Growing Companies in America and are currently in 27 states. Because of the influx of new agents in 2020, they had 74% revenue growth between Q3 2019 vs Q3 2020.  

Fathom also bought a title company in 2020 which should create additional opportunity on each transaction completed by their agents to make additional revenue by being the company who manages the title search (around $75 to $200 per transaction). This does not mean they WILL get that additional revenue on each transaction, but the opportunity will be there when it wasn’t before. 

I do not expect the acquisitions to end there. They just acquired 230 additional agents in Atlanta through the acquisition of Red Barn Real Estate on 3/5/2021 to add on to the 200 agents Fathom already had in the area per their press release.

Overall I moved my business to Fathom for the reasons I listed above. I believe in the company and I like the stock.",stocks,FTHM Fathom Realty DD,11.0,0.88

I still hold some GME, which I don't want to have tied up in an ACAT transfer given everything that is going on.  I have mid-five-figures in Robinhood and I'll be adding almost the same amount in new cash.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand, my options are:

A) Partial ACAT - move everything except GME and leave that with Robinhood for now.  Sell it when I'm ready to sell, then move the cash later.

B) Deposit my matching funds in the new brokerage and buy everything in the new brokerage at the same time I sell everything in Robinhood, then move the cash from Robinhood.  This is nice because it is fast, and it saves on the transfer fee.

C) Are there options I haven't thought of?

&amp;#x200B;

Option A is annoying due to Robinhood's transfer fee, but that's not the end of the world, and I'm guessing is my best course of action?  I mostly don't want to leave anything with them at all, but I guess that wouldn't be the end of the world either.

What kind of issues does Option B create?  I'm assuming tax issues are my biggest challenge?  I just don't know how this would affect me.

183,psychotrader00,0.0,48.0,"Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights

The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

**1. Product and history**  
**2. Future of the company**  
**3. numbers, number, numbers**  
**3.1 market cap, outstanding shares, employees, ownership, stock movements**  
**3.2 earnings, dividends, margins and growth**

**5. sources and listings**  
**6. TLDR**

# 1. Product and history

Kemria Oyj is a finish organisation that was founded in 1920 to focus on delivering fertilizers and mining chemicals like sulfuric acids. To make it short from here, they got a lot of capital and over the next couple decades they just bought themselves in to a lot of chemistry fields through aquisitions and merger of and with other companies. Only since 1971, the company is named Kemira.  
Basically they never stopped doing this until after the 2000s in which they decided to not just buy up every chemical company there is, but rather specialize on a couple products. They were already running on basically every continent selling to over 100 countries.  
The products they specialized on was the paper industry, water industry and its recycling as well as the energy efficiency optimization. The company is all about using ressources right in a world where ressources are getting shorter in supply which brings me to point 2:

# 2. Future of the company

The company is building it's business around a couple megatrends like recycling, clean water as well as reliable energy saving. More and more business are trying to get access to affordable energy and are forced by the public to set on clean water and recycling resulting in a bigger and brighter future for this massive company. But a company betting on future trends while being 100 years old? Exactly! The company is running profits for decades while still going into massive trends and how good these profits are is mentioned below in point 3:

# 3. Numbers, numbers, numbers

**3.1 Market cap, shares, ownership, movements**

Kemira is making moves in over 100 countries with it's over 5000 employees while currently sitting at

* **Market Cap:** **€2.100b with** **152.92m Shares outstanding**

These shares are currently owned by 2/3 institutions, companies and insiders while only **32.7%** are open for the general public.

These shares moved **18.0% up** in the last 365 days while over a period of 30 days they actually lost **1.7%.** This might be okay in comparison to the overall finish market moving **16.8%** in the last 365 days. But looking at the chemical industry in finland moving **23.2%** in last 365 days and **2.2%** in the last 30 days, they seem to underperform.

So let's look at the finances to understand why this might be.

**3.2 Earnings, dividends and growth**

Lets look at the price/earnings ratio:  
**-&gt; Kemira: 16.1x -&gt;Industry23.9x -&gt;Market27.7x**

While Kemira Oyj stock was even going down a bit while market moved up and significantly lacking in stock price performane compared to the market, it actually has a far better earnings ratio than the industry aswell as the market. This is also supported by the price/book ratio being at **1.8x** compared to **2.2x** in the finish market.

The **dividends** being payed by Kemira are representing a **4,21% return** coming up on March 25 with 68% of earnings being payed out. Interestingly enough, this is higher than the average of the top 25% dividend stocks in the industry paying **3.9%.**

In terms of growth the company is forecasting a growth rate of **5%**, which is funny as they predicted this the last years aswell, while growing earnings by **12.1%** per year on last 5 year average which last year growth rate being at **19%.** ( Interestingly enough, the industrys growth rate in last year was negative with a downfall of **-10.5%**, showing that Kemira is setting on future trends in the chemistry sector)

The company is not only building up more clients and getting into more technology but also leveled up their net profit margin from **4.1%** to **5.4%** YoY.

One downside factor for investors might be their debt level sitting at **66.2%** debt to equity. (last year was **66.6%**)  
This might possibly be a good thing though as their interest payments are well covered by EBIT with a **7.7x** coverage aswell as an operating cash flow of **47%.**

# 4. Personal opinion

Kemira Oyj is not only a company in a northern european country giving it a basic security in terms of fraud and legislations, but it is also a company that has been build for a century. They are currently running a business in a solid industry and are outperforming the market in terms of growth rate and price/earnings ratio while still having the least stock movement. Their financials are solid with a good EBIT while also having massive amount of cash flow and a dividend yield of over **4%.** The management not only knows how to perform through rough times, but also make their company better through them by even lowering their debt and increasing their profit margins.  
Besides the long and safe history of the company and its good financials, I think it will also have a huge chance coming up in the sectors they are building up. Water will soon be a scarce ressource just like precious metals and the same goes for energy. Kemira is positioning itself in a perfect way by being a giant in a race of rabbits looking to be the next big thing coming from 10 people to 10.000 while Kemira can just go from 5000 to 10000 quite easily.  
Even if you do not see the future upside potential, then the finances alone lead me to the conclusion of a company that is overlooked and heavily underrated. This is a sale that might not last for long, but it can really boost your portfolio in terms of balance, safety and dividens. While I am not a financial expert, I expect the stock to move from its current price of **13.79€ to 15€** by july and with it currently gaining traction and news coverage in some places I can see it hitting **16€ or 17€** by end of year if we keep seeing this bull market continuing. This might sound like a stupid play with a gain of **25%** max this year but compared to 0% interest I think its a nice deal and it presents some cooler notifications on my phone compared to GME movements and other bets.

IF they play their cards right aswell and keep outperforming the market, keep lowering their debt, keep building up their margins and continue with great financials, the price/earnings ratio will very soon be a lot higher. Add this to the future trend they are facing and they might be able to make big moves resulting in a 5x in this decade if you use your imagination for a minute.

Followup from this post. I was invested since 2019 but this time I just couldn't shake the feeling of it going down fast. Ever since the [China fiasco](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/tech/tesla-china-regulators-intl-hnk/index.html) and the way Elon purchased bitcoin just came across as such a desperate publicity stunt.

I was studying the dividends of different companies, and how the stock price changes in correlation with anticipated dividends, and I made an observation.  


AJRD Aerojet Rocketdyne which was bought by Lockheed, is paying a 5$ per share dividend this year.  
Share price is 51 USD.  


As stated in Financial report Q4: [https://ir.aerojetrocketdyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aerojet-rocketdyne-holdings-inc-reports-2020-fourth-quarter-and](https://ir.aerojetrocketdyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aerojet-rocketdyne-holdings-inc-reports-2020-fourth-quarter-and)  


 On December 19, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a one-time cash dividend of $5.00 per share (including shares underlying the 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes (“2¼% Notes”) on an as-converted basis) (the “Pre-Closing Dividend”).   


The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on March 24, 2021, to the holders of the Company’s shares and convertible senior notes as of the close of business on March 10, 2021. The $56.00 per share price under the Merger Agreement is expected to be reduced to $51.00 after the pre-closing payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend to the Company’s stockholders and holders of its 2¼% Notes on as-converted basis.   


  
As compared to other companies' dividend, this is pretty good.  


My question:  


\*Is the price likely to stay stable (50$+) Until the dividend is paid?

DISCLAIMER: i’m new to this channel and neither a financial advisor nor an expert. 

the following is just intended to explain my intuition about what has been happening in markets over the past weeks and why many people are seeing red. 

—

# 1 : the value of companies

whoever values a company professionally, usually applies a discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation. it's not the only method to find the actual value, but by far the most common one used by analysts. the idea here is that a company has the value of the sum of all its future cash flows. this is a solid assumption, because in the end cash flows are what determines whether the company is successful in the long-term and how much money it can distribute to its investors. so the two basic questions are: how high will these cash flows be and what value do they have currently?

# 2 : the time value of money

now let's say a company will make 1bn in cash next year. that amount is not actually its current value. if i had the money now, i can invest it and gain interest in that one year. an important tool joins the party now: the risk-free rate. this is, usually, the interest rate on certain short-term government bills or bonds. they are risk-less, because in theory states cannot default. now, if i had the 1bn right now, i could make 1.5% return with it during the year, without any real risk. therefore, in one year from now, this 1bn only amounts to 985 million in todays money (you just divide by 1 + interest rate to the power of years). basically money loses value if you have to wait for it, because you have to miss out on the opportunities of doing something profitable with that money until then. 

# 3 : discounting

the process of deriving the current (usually lower) value of future cash flows is called discounting. you discount the future cash flows to their present value. this is where the DCF got its name. many applications use the risk-free rate as discounting rate, in stock valuations however, a common rate is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). the WACC is a weighted combination of a companies financing costs from the two main sources: debt and equity. debt financing are things like bonds and credit and their main cost is the interest they carry. equity financing is usually the emission of stocks and the cost of equity is whatever yield investors may demand, given the risk of the investment. the WACC incorporates both debt and equity costs based on the firms capital structure. 

# 4 : forecasting cash flows 

let's get back to our DCF from the first point. you would generally model the specific cash flows of a company for about 5 years and then add in something called ""terminal value"" for everything that comes after that. it is unrealistic that any forecast after 5 years is still accurate, so you just assume a company's last cash flow will grow with a certain rate (e.g. 2% like the global economy - at least long-term) and then calculate the total final value of said company, assuming it will exist forever. let's stick with the 1bn example: assuming this is the last year modeled and we assume 2% growth and a WACC of 1.5%. then, all future cash flows amount to 51 billion. this is called gordon-growth-model: just calculate the next cash flow after the last one with your growth rate and then divide it by the discount rate minus the growth rate: (1bn * 1.02) / (0.04 - 0.02). usually most of the companies value comes from this ""infinite horizon cash flow"" and the value is highly sensitive to both the discounting rate and the assumed growth rate. these future growth and interest rates are precisely what commentators mean when they say ""expectations are already priced in"" and it is one of the reasons why it is hard to beat the pros at their game. 

# 5 : inflation

of course, an interest rate of 1.5% is not getting you any real return if inflation is just as high: the money is being devalued per unit at the same speed as the units of money grow. this is why real interest rates must incorporate for inflation. the fisher equation shows this relationship: real interest rates are equal to the nominal interest rate minus inflation. if we stick with 1.5% interest and have an inflation of 0.5%, then the real interest rate is 1%. 

# 6 : what is happening right now?

central banks all over the world are pouring money into the markets and governments are using the chance of low interest rates to finance large fiscal stimuli in order to stabilise covid-hit economies. this new money supply creates inflation and the interest rates on bonds must compensate for it. higher expectations of inflation are therefore priced into the yields of such bonds. these higher interest rates however mean that all current valuations must be adapted for the new discount rate: we must now discount all future earnings with a higher rate and will end up with a lower present value of the firm. 

# 7 : where will it end ?

nobody knows - honestly. but valuations have gotten pretty excessive. i dont want to blame SPACs or robinhood, but they are definitely part of it. there are just too many companies with sky-high valuations that have not even made revenue or generated real income. these growth stocks have all of their value stuck in those projected future cash flows and they are not only getting discounted. investors are probably (and hopefully) also reevaluating whether growth expectations are somehow realistic or whether the valuation is not justified. lastly, debt financing costs of these companies (which often have no cash to pay for projects) also increase and lead to a higher WACC. if you are looking for a hedge against higher interest rates, financials are the place to be: their business model is to lend money at a rate higher than they borrow it for.

I am checking my portfolio several times per hour, reading tons of articles about this company and that forecast, at least few hours per day on reddit (stocks, investing, wallstreetbet sub reddits...), also at least an hour listening to podcasts related to investing.  I had a sort of an epiphany last Friday, as I was on a boat trip with friends, beautiful weather and all, everybody having fun, I was sneaking to the rest room every 30 min to check my portfolio. 

True, I like making gains, but after losing 60K of unrealized gains in just 2 weeks and go a bit on the negative on my investment account of 9 months, which I was mostly putting only high growth stocks, I have realized that it is just not worth the stress and amount of time needed to keep up to date with all the news, politics, pandemic status, etc... At least I thank God that I am still in the green (still up by around 100k in total, but that is mostly due to my investment account that is almost 6 years old and to which I have been adding mostly conservative/value stocks and the few growth stocks I have there, I have been taking profit regularly rather than wait for something to become a 10bagger).

So my plan for this year, hopefully before summer, is to have transferred at least 60% of my porfolio into some boring indexes like vanguard (I have less than 1% on that now), 20% on some sector ETFs (semiconductors, clean energy, for example), and play the individual company stock game only on  20% of my portfolio, which I will check not more than a couple of times a week  (to keep track of things and make some buys or profit taking).

Do you think my approach is OK? Anyone on the same boat?

235,Milanoate,0.0,1.0,"The TDOC book value was 18-19B, or $105.7 per share. That would give the price to book value ratio of less than 1.8.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TDOC/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TDOC/key-statistics/)

I admit I rarely pay attention to the book value for fast-growth stocks as it is generally a very small number compared to the market cap. However I was surprised by this number of TDOC, as 1.8 is the number for a big blue chip, not a number for growth tech companies. If this is a valid number, then the stock is very much undervalued.

However, when I looked at the history of the price-to-book ratio, I found there is a sudden jump of book value at the end of 2020 (from 13-14 to \~2 in one day, between 12/30 and 12/31). This suggests a sudden change of the valuation of certain asset, maybe overvaluation. Anyone knows what happened there? What changed the book valuation so dramatically, or maybe my source of data was wrong?

242,Neighbor_,0.0,3.0,"The GME situation has me thinking: What is the optimal way to play a squeeze? It's ridiculously hard to find any information regarding the specific trades you should be doing to exit a squeeze in which you have a long position in. Obviously you want to sell near the peak to maximize gains, but the peak is never known beforehand.

Because squeezes aren't that common, there isn't much data available to develop a hypothesis around. For this reason, this will mostly have to be speculation.

Even though squeezes themselves may be rare, the concept of a stock going up rapidly and each investor put into a prison's dilemma ensues more often than this.

So how to optimally play this is the question. Let's also use the hypothetical of GME going to $150 -&gt; $10,000 over a day as an example. Obviously, you don't *know* it's going to go up that high.

 *  What should you be doing during the ride up? Constantly set sell limits 50% above current? Refresh your stop limit to stay under $100 below current?

 * What *the hell* does the ride down look like? It seems likely that quite literally nobody would be trying to buy a stock that is going from $10,000 -&gt; $20 rapidly. **Can you even sell during the ride down?** It feels like nobody would be buying at that point.

 * How necessary is it to form a selling plan early? If you're trying to just wing-it and watch, is this even a viable option. Or would you be placing your sell limit @ $9,000 when it's down in the hundreds?

Shouldn't bond yield always be higher than inflation rate?

# Introduction

Let's get started. If this looks too long for you, please know that half of it is literally pictures. Just gonna say right here that I'm not going to be detailing this down to the point of analyzing every car model the company sells, even though it's probably important. Mainly because I'm lazy and don't want to write that much, but I am for sure no expert in cars at all and I don't have the qualifications to lecture you on car models. Maybe some car genius in the comments will. Also, I'm not gonna be discussing sector rotation or whatever. Figure out how to play it if based on your market thesis. Alright enough chit chat let's get to business.

Keep in mind the recent price range: $38-31

**Company Biography:**

NIO Limited designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV.

So to summarize:

\- Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars

\- Offers a multitude of charging solutions

\- Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later)

\- Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own)

\- Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages

Now that's a handful and we don't have all day, so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS. This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment, it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things.

# Market and Competition

**Market**

Honestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future, but it's worth mentioning regardless.

The EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%, and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026, worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD, or $500 Billion. (Also, for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is, it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%. Not overall, but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur.) What's more, is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth. Here's a graph that represents these projections.

If we take a more specific look to NIO's market, analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts, now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025. Beyond that, the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration, respectively.

**Strategy**

The Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board, so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model. Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent, stable order flow, rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. (Courtesy of J.P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady, Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.

We could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out. [Apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170556if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kucf6r/chinese_autist_here_gonna_share_you_western/) Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don't have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.

BaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.

Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the Chinese government favors BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there's that too.

**Catalysts**

I don't actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in.

\- European Market Expansion

\- Rapid Clean Tech Movement

\- New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors

\- NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year

\- Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but here's an article written by [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-chinese-ev-maker-nio-might-be-coming-to-america-51612892800) claiming that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market.

**Local environment**

Let's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 143 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.

This all sounds great, right? We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let's move on.

Now as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here's why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.  On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they're the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where's the relation to cars? It's not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.

\- China is the *largest* EV market in the world, representing roughly *50%* of worldwide sales.

\- From 2019 to 2020, Chinese EV sales increased *550%,* from 200,00 units to 1,300,000 units.

\- China expects sales to grow nearly *40%* this year despite the pandemic, growing from 1,300,000 units to over 1,800,000 units.

Between these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability.

# Financials and Numbers

Not gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.

**Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook**

* Q4 Revenues grew 46.7% Quarter over Quarter, reaching $1.02 Billion, while many expected $1.04 Billion.
* Deliveries reached 17,000 Units for Q4. For reference they sold 40,000 units in 2020.
* NIO projects 20,000+ Units for Q1 of 2021, which is 15% quarter over quarter. Again, for reference they sold 40,000 units for 2020. What's more is that in Q1 2020, they only sold 4k cars but in Q1 2021 they're projected to do **400%** that number a year later. This type of growth is probably the most appealing aspect to potential investors the way I see it.
* Gross and Vehicle Margin grew to 17.2%
* NIO generated positive cash-flow
* Despite the tech restraints from battery/chip shortages, management says production levels will be able to remain 'normal'
* Even with the production constraints through Q2, NIO's outright delivery and revenue growth are visible - the company is on track to deliver nearly the same amount of cars in Q1/Q2 as it had in 2020.
* NIO trades at about 13.1x projected FY21 revenues

**Q4 Negative Highlights**

* Due to the Semiconductor/Chip Shortage, NIO is expecting a bit of a bump in the road in terms of deliveries in the early half of the year
* With the combination of chip and battery constraints, NIO expects monthly production through Q2 to cap around \~7,500 units,  a 25% decrease from Q1 projections.
* Net Loss for Q4 clocked in at $1.3 Billion USD
* Operating Losses weren't reduced a whole lot
* Missed EPS estimates
* No dividend

# Investment Outlook

**Analyst Consensus**

Need a third opinion? This is one of the **biggest green flags** IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 31-38 (As of Mar. 5)

Price targets:

\- HSBC: $49

\- Morgan Stanley: $80

\- J.P. Morgan: $75

\- Deutsche: $70

\- Bank of America: $70

\- Goldman Sachs: $64

\- Daiwa: $100

**Conclusion**

Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the Asia Pacific market, but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of [William Li](https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-li/?sh=894e17911a13), calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'. There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others.

For this thesis, I think it's important to keep in mind how much the price has dipped recently. I mean within the past month it's been as high as 61, and as low as 31. EV's have taken a beating in these red days, and may even continue to decrease. I personally find any prices under 35 extremely appealing, but that general sub 40 area is pretty solid IMO. Hell, it almost went sub 30 on the 5th. I primarily like the growth opportunity Nio presents, especially when considering the discount its been at. It's also important to recognize that these dips may continue with tech/growth/EV stocks, so probably factor that into your opinion and remember to also consider the long term prospect.

This took hours, hope you enjoyed.

My positions: None, I'm absolutely broke, I just like to write analyses and research.

--------------------

In case you don't know either of those terms:

**Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.

**Fails–to–Deliver** — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.

------------------------

However, it doesn't explain the consequences of a FTD from naked shorts.

Couldn't hudge funds just naked short until eternity instead of covering in the required 21 days.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-8-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq set for sharp drop after Friday’s comeback

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Monday, with a sharp drop in the Nasdaq and tech names indicated to start the new week after Friday’s big turnaround. Tesla shed another 2% in the premarket after closing Friday below $600 per share for the first time since early December. The stock has lost a third of its value since its all-time intraday high in late January.

&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday all broke three-session losing streaks, with strong advances. For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 gained 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. However, the Nasdaq dropped 2% last week. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were up nearly 3% and 2.3%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq was just above breakeven ahead of Monday’s open.

*****

&gt; # 2. Treasury yields rise after Senate Covid relief bill passage

&gt; * Senate passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill Saturday wasn’t enough to put stocks in the green Monday as more economic stimulus on top of an already recovering economy continued to stoke inflation concerns. That’s pushing bond yields higher Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading around 1.6%, shy of Friday’s one-year high. The 10-year yield has risen rapidly since the end of January, adding more than 0.5% in a little over a month.

*****

&gt; # 3. Biden says direct payments of up to $1,400 going out soon

&gt; * The Democratic-held House aims to pass the Senate-approved Covid stimulus package on Tuesday and then send it President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill approved in the Senate on Saturday comes with a smaller, compromise federal unemployment benefits boost and without a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation includes direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, which Biden said Saturday could start going out within two weeks.

*****

&gt; # 4. Stocks to watch: Disney, Comcast, GameStop, GE

&gt; * Shares of Disney rose more than 1% in Monday’s premarket trading after California officials on Friday cleared theme parks to open at reduced capacity on April 1. They closed nearly a year ago due to the pandemic. The order includes Disneyland in the southern part of the state, Comcast’s Universal Studios Hollywood and others. Disney World in Florida and Universal Studios Orlando opened with capacity limits over the summer. Shares of Comcast, parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC, fell in the premarket.

&gt; * Shares of GameStop surged about 12% in Monday’s premarket after Bloomberg reported that the company tapped board member Ryan Cohen to guide the video game retailer’s transition to an e-commerce business. Cohen, a major GameStop investor and founder of online pet retailer Chewy, will lead a board task force on digital changes.

&gt; * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland’s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world’s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday’s premarket.

*****

&gt; # 5. Oil prices rise after Saudi Arabia facilities attacked

&gt; * Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose above $70 per barrel Monday for the first time in more than a year. The surge came after Saudi Arabia said Sunday that its Saudi Aramco facilities were targeted by missiles and drones. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attack. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also moved higher, trading above $66 at nearly a two-year high.

**Stock: UWM Holdings ($UWMC)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: +1286.9%

Month on Month increase in mentions: +2762%

Average sentiment across mentions: **+21.83%**

**Core Product**

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC’s mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)

**Financials**

UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.

UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.

Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.

Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)

Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to the GME case in short interest (140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)

NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).

**Risk and Competition**

75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC’s refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.

There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don’t completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).

The full impact of UWMC’s CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn’t work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.

**Conclusion**

This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play.

**TLDR: Do you invest in companies that you find ethically compatible with your values?**

**Not so TLDR** \- I am lurking here for quite a long time and I particularly love this subreddit - I find it grounded and really helped me reset my head after the GME craze of a couple of months back.

I am reaching out because, as you are, I like to invest: I am doing it for a while and it is a very healthy way to approach your finances when it comes to retirement, FIRE, or just direct your future a bit.

But I like to care about the environment, and I want to put my money where my mouth is (is this the expression?).

So I started to diversify in the direction that I care the most about - ETF Clean Energy, Sustainable companies (ex. Blackrock), etc. (and I will admit, still have a good chunk in ETF World, which includes as well terrible companies, therefore I am trying to slowly dissociate from the ETF).

And this makes me wonder: How many other people base part of their DD on the sustainability of a company? Is it something that should be taken into consideration?

276,MrNoOneYet,0.0,26.0,"Hey guys - this is NOT financial advise, and I own stocks myself.

I think Ericsson could be a nice bet for the medium-long term portfolio. 

Ericsson is, to say the least, leading the race in 5G - and they are... Swedish! This is increasingly important due to the other major 5G companies being Asian (Samsung and Huawei). 

It has been said that Huawei is leading in this 5G race, however, recent investigation uncovered that: 

“Ericsson leads the field with 16.1 percent of 5G patent families. Samsung has 11.0 percent, and then Huawei with 9.4 percent (the rest of the industry accounts for the other 63.5 percent).”

Apart from this, Ericsson had a new CEO take over in 2017 and has presented sound financials since. They have even suggested to increase their upcoming divided to 2 SEK.

With 5G being specifically designed for the M2M context (IoT), I see it playing a much more important role in society than 3G or even 4G has ever done.

Consumer discretionary should outperform consumer staples in good times. This shows XLY (which is mostly Amazon and Home Depot) is dipping, but the equal wait versions (in the middle) show things are just fine. Just because Amazon is falling doesn't mean the average stock here is doing bad.

PFE is expected to gain $15 billion in increase revenue because of the covid vaccine in 2021, which is a 20-30% increase in revenue. I don't think this is priced in yet.

**The Trade:**

Buy long dated calls. PFE volatility is super low and calls are cheap AF. I bought 50 delta September calls for \~$200.

**Now expanding on this:**

\- Yes PFE stock price shot up and back down in December, bc of the news of FDA approval. People got scared out of their positions and the price dropped way wayyy back down, and its at a solid support to buy from right now.  high upside, low downside at this point.

\- The operational costs, and research &amp; development costs were priced in last year, (for the most part). This is why they had low earnings last year. They had the upfront operational costs for the vaccine, but they had no actual revenue yet, bc the vaccine had not been distributed.

\- Expected 2 billion doses to deliver by end of 2021, but may change if additional contracts are signed. So there is even more potential revenue growth. The revenue growth will probably peak in 2021 and taper off in 2022. However, the view of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla is, "" I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting now.""

\- There is a ton of negative attention on PFE stock right now. It seems to be nothing to do with the fundamentals, but just the fact that the stock is boring and not moving. But there has been the idea floating around that the covid vaccine isnt a money maker. I actually thought this myself before i started to research it.  Here is some of the ridiculous negative comments [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnowlf/why_did_game_changing_vaccine_stocks_like_pfe/)

\- Diving a little deeper into the trade idea. Buying calls is a brilliant play and credit goes to an article I read by Trevor Soare. PFE is sitting at a historic lows of implied volatility (IV). This means calls are cheap. Next earnings will be in 2 months, so there will be an increase in volatility up until that point. So my calls will gain value even if the stock price doesnt move. This will also provide some cushing even if the stock price does go down.

\- Micheal Burry has 15% in long calls on PFE. However noteworthy, Warren Buffet did exit his PFE position last year.

“Amazon orders more than 1000 natural gas powered engines...” What’s their play here? Why natural gas when it doesn’t meet zero emissions? 

Simply put, the answer is renewable natural gas (RNG). If you read the news from major fleet operators the past two years, they are ALL relying on RNG and making major commitments to RNG, at least for the next decade. Amazon, for one, is well aware that the nat gas engines can utilize RNG. This strategically puts them in a position to meet zero emission standards. UPS has made HUGE commitments to RNG going as far as purchasing large supplies of RNG with commitments up to 2026. FedEx as well. Anheuser-Busch with Agility... list goes on. Theme here for major fleet operators is RNG. Existing natural gas infrastructure is there unlike electric infrastructure. The only question in the future is can supply meet increased demand? 

What is the advantage of Hyliion’s primary product Hypertruck ERX set to debut this year? Electrification powered by RNG! This means more miles than conventional nat gas RNG trucks AND less demand on RNG = cost savings aka the perfect solution. I think with this understanding of current environment, we can expect to hear some major announcements and deals in the future with ERX.

Basically, the ERX is the logical next step for Amazon and UPS. As they are already heavily investing in RNG, the Hyper truck ERX is a no brainer (once it’s out).",stocks,Why I’m long on Hyliion $HYLN,16.0,0.8

287,Environmental_Yam_57,0.0,19.0,"While the media has drew a clear linkage between recent yield spikes (particularly on the 10 yr) and inflationary worries to the corrections in growth stocks - I believe the true reason that the market has been spooked is because the perceived transition from a Fed-based market (back into) an economy-based market.

As market participants are betting on the end of Covid pandemic is near, one realization is that the Fed will gradually decelerate QE and eventually stop “babysitting” the market. Recent yield 10 Yr spikes and comments made by JPowell could have been seen as evidence to back up this expectation. 

In short, since the start of the pandemic, the Fed has encouraged cheap lending and borrowing via purchasing long term securities such as the 10yr vía open market which artificially increased bond prices thus suppressing yield; the unprofitability of long term assets has then led a big influx into more liquid assets such as cash (known commonly as “liquidity traps” to increase money supply). 

Given the subsequent abundance of liquidity, risky assets, especially those of more speculative nature such as growth stocks then saw very strong momentum during these cheap money environments
since participants are now fully “risk-on”.

However, with vaccines becoming widely available and an economic re-opening appears to be imminent, market participants are sensing that perhaps soon, QE will decelerate as Fed let go of the leash. Evidently, recently bonds sell offs which led yields to spike at a worrisome pace led participants to further believe Fed is ready to “let go” and eventually preparing for transition back into an economy-based market. 

Given the above, I think the above will at least partly justify why some of the richly valued growth stocks have been selling off; while re-opening stocks outperformed. I think at this points, perhaps hints of YCC can quickly stop the tech hemorrhage; otherwise the market will continue to remain volatile until an equilibrium is found. 

Please let me know your thoughts! 

TLDR: 1) the recent correction of growth stocks is likely due to the uncertainties faced by participants caught in midst of a transition from a Fed-based market back into an economy-based market. 
2) The perceived ending of “liquidity traps” (rather than purely inflationary worries) is the true culprit behind the market sell offs IMO.",stocks,The reasons I believe that’s causing the recent market corrections,19.0,0.84
288,x--BANKS--x,0.0,49.0,"It’s clear the narrative of the market right now is about the rotation from growth to value stocks. There are going to be a lot of fearful investors moving their money, and a lot of fund managers buying up value stocks to please their skittish customers. 

So I started looking for stocks with a low P/E ratio and the highest StarMine scores. StarMine is a scoring system used on Fidelity and some other brokers which uses an aggregate of analyst ratings. In other words, these stocks are universally rated buy and a likely target of cautious investors, and their low P/E puts them into the value basket. I’m not trying to get complicated. I’m looking for undervalued stocks with mainstream surface appeal. 

(Important to note that I am not saying StarMine scores are an accurate ranking of stocks, but only that I'm using them a proxy for where mainstream money will go during this rotation.)

The first group is what I’ll call Value Boomer Bait:
 
* StarMine Equity Score of 9.1 or higher
* Consumer discretionary company with a household name  
* P/E ratio below 18

This gives you four good leads:

* WILLIAMS-SONOMA (WSM)
* AUTONATION (AN)
* JACK IN THE BOX (JACK)
* 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (FLWS)

Two similar leads without household names are AMERICA'S CAR-MART (CRMT) and HAVERTY FURNITURE (HVT).

The second group of obvious value stocks I found are some undervalued recreational boating companies with steady growth. ONEWATER MARINE (ONEW) and MARINEMAX (HZO) are high-end boat retailers, both with a StarMine score of 9.7, both with a P/E ratio of 11.9, and both with steady growth that was unaffected by the market sell-off. You can also look at BRUNSWICK CORP (BC), a manufacturer of boat components, which has a StarMine score of 9.4 and a P/E of 19.3. 

A lot of people have been looking at homebuilding recently, so here’s the homebuilders with a StarMine Score of 9.1 or higher and a P/E below 12:

* GREEN BRICK PARTNERS (GRBK)
* CENTURY COMMUNITIES (CCS)
* BEAZER HOMES USA (BZH)

And finally, here is a list of the top StarMine Equity Score by each sector, so I’m guessing you’ll see inflows into each of these:

Comm. Serv.

* 8.7 LUMN Lumen

Cons. Disc.

* 10.0 ASO Academy

Cons. Stap.

* 9.8 BG Bunge 

Energy

* 9.2 DVN Devon Energy

Financials

* 10.0 SF Stifel Financial 

Health Care

* 9.8 HOLX Hologic 

Industrials

* 10.0 ATKR Atkore

Info. Tech.

* 10.0 LOGI Logitech

Materials

* 9.7 Tronox

Real Estate

* 9.8 IIPR Innovative Ind Properties

Utilities

* 8.7 AY Atlantica

Obviously this is just a starting point for capturing the mainstream money, but I think there are some good buys here if you want to add value stocks. Or you could throw a dart and pick any of about 30 financial stocks that are universally rated buy. My picks are: 

* ROYAL CANADIAN (RY, 9.4 StarMine, 11 P/E)
* CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK (CM, 9.4 StarMine, 10 P/E)
* ENSTAR GROUP (ESGR, 10.0 StarMine, 3 P/E)
* VIRTU (VIRT, 9.9 StarMine, 5 P/E)

Everybody is saying that the stock market is going down because of the higher yield in bonds. I get why that would happen. I know it COULD be the reason. I don't want an explanation about why higher bond yields affect growth stocks.

However, would it be possible that there would be a bond selloff for some other reason at the same time as a stock selloff, making it seem like one is causing the other?

Of course, a bond selloff drives the price of bonds down and thus its yield up.

Is there something that shows us that bond yield is going up for some other reason than a bond selloff?

Edit: Someone asked so here is my theory about the cause of all this:

I think there is enormous pressure on the short sellers, which make a up a huge part of the market to close their positions because of margin calls. A lot of stocks with VERY high short interest have been going steadily up (like GME, to name the biggest one) and the short sellers need to liquidate both their bonds and their stocks to pay for those overpriced stocks and close their positions.

So, at the same time as the stock market is going down, the bond market is too, driving the yields up. They have no correlation between each other but they are both caused by short sellers needing liquidity to buy GME and other stocks they shorted.",stocks,"Cause and effect, bonds and stocks",3.0,0.72

They were on sale and I assume people will be using them during the pandemic. Average intelligent move. There was no depth to it.

Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting).

**Why ARK?**

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations**
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies 
   * To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point*** **for more research**

**My Process &amp; Selection Criteria**

* First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.
* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.
* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings):
   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 71%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26%
   * LTM revenue growth: 46%
   * LTM gross margins: 48%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36%
   * LTM revenue growth: 27%
   * LTM gross margins: 87%
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%)
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data.
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 57%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15%
   * LTM revenue growth: 33%
   * LTM gross margins: 53%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products

**Edit:** One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys.

I just discovered that they're getting charged 7% interest even though I've never used margin.  Turns out that Questrade doesn't automatically convert CAD to USD so when I use CAD to buy US stocks (which I did), they treat it as though I've borrowed that amount of USD and charge interest accordingly.  This strikes me as being about as close to theft as you can get.  They're charging interest on money I haven't actually borrowed simply because they don't bother to convert currencies (which they do in registered accounts, by the way).

Is this standard across all brokerages, or just a terrible Questrade policy?

Any advice on how to fix this mess?  I don't have the extra cash to deposit to cover the ""loan"", so their only other suggestion is to sell the stocks and then convert the CAD to USD.

313,GoldnDiesel,0.0,13.0,"So like many of us, I've been following this movement with meme stocks very closely wondering if there is money to be made other than just some quick day/swing trades. I've done a ton of research, specifically on AMC because although many expect the ""squeeze"" for GME to be much more likely, the price it's at is very unrealistic and so IF it doesn't happen, then there's not much in terms of future value with a stock already prices that high. Basically it seems much more reliant on a squeeze than anything for your investment. 

AMC I'm looking at with a slightly different view.. yes it is a meme stock, yes it is overpriced at the moment, yes they have been bleeding money due to Covid..

But with all that said, apart from just the ""potential"" for a squeeze, this surge in price they were able to capitalize on and sell shares to raise funds last month to reduce their debt significantly. They also gained an extremely high amount of publicity and sentiment from the public, they have now discussed the option to issue even more shares (which will be kept basically in the war chest by the sounds of it) and I believe they have a very positive plan for them.

These shares can be used for many things, not just in a negative way by diluting shares to raise capital (which if they went this route, I'm sure they would have BIG plans for that money). Instead I think it may be used for positive things like dividends or a stock split. 

Think about it, the company was in the dirt on the brink of bankruptcy and was/still is being heavily shorted.. why not make the big brain move and reward investors who saved them, and screw over the short sellers who tried to destroy them? Is this not what Tesla did? 

Of course, they are losing money, the Earnings report on Wednesday will show this. But that's not at all what I'm thinking about, investors these days aren't just buying things that make sense from a financial perspective. There is reports and facts backing that up.. So I'm actually fairly optimistic that they will release some big news with plans to grow and thrive long term. Is that a bit speculative? Sure, but they would be very smart to do this while everyone is riding the wave. 

They know they need to make change, thus my thinking of the current price actually a fairly reasonable price point. Not because of the current financials, but because of the sentiment behind what is currently happening and basically the value many are seeing just by holding and having faith that the company will improve its business model and come out with progressive growth ideas for the future. 

I'm NOT the typical meme stock investor relying on the potential squeeze. I am optimistic about the long term potential here, and think the downside risk is actually not as big as people think (unlike GME at its current price). When I say long term potential, I'm thinking maybe $12-15 over the next year or so? Do I hope it can be higher? Of course, but I think that's on the safe side, while my downside price point is around $6. So I definitely see a higher reward vs risk potential in AMC. 

There are plenty of other DD posts around if you are looking for some numbers to back this thought/theory up. I have read all of them, and have come up with this prediction on my own.

317,gohackthat,0.0,8.0,"Hello investors,

As we await for another tumultuous week ahead, I wanted to share a strategy with the group to help mitigate some of the risks embedded in our portfolios.

Quick reminder, my goal is to share the things I was taught in hopes to not only help educate others but also to remind myself of those key lessons because I often forget them myself.

I understand many people have started trading this past year and that is exactly why I started this forum. I'd hate to see people lose their hard-earned money but more importantly, give up on the game without learning anything.

Two parts to this memo: market thoughts and hedging strategy.

**1) My view on the markets right now.**

Like I mentioned in this memo, this correction is more concerning than the ones we've experienced recently, specifically the September 2020 selloff. It's because of the inflation expectations, rising yields, and Fed's complacency on letting the long-end rates soar, all of which together triggered MOVE index to tick higher. (MOVE index is the interest rate volatility index, similar to the VIX index for stocks)

📷

Not only higher volatility but also a steeper yield curve.

📷

What I also talked about in the memo is that I am not as worried about this correction because of the following reasons.

\- Liquidity in the markets is strong.

\- Fed has been constantly emphasizing its continued support to the proper functioning of the markets.

\- Fiscal spending is not going away.

\- Expected economic recovery

Given the limited data resources, this is the best of what I could find from CapIQ to assess the short-term lending conditions.

📷

Also from what I found on other sources, it seems that the short-term borrowing rates are holding steady, most likely because of the expected cash dump by the Treasury (see the memo for what I'm referring to) and Fed's short-term Treasury purchases.

Not only the liquidity but the Fed and fiscal spending have been the primary drivers of the markets in the past few months, neither of which is going away anytime soon.

Lastly, the expected economic recovery given the vaccine rollout and pent-up demand will likely support the markets for an upward bounce.

Below chart shows the market sentiment as to how bearish the market participants are. It seems to me it's getting more attractive to buy into the markets because the higher the ratio, more bearish the sentiment is.

📷

Ideally, I would want to get charts for FRA-OIS 3 month spread (up to date, most are available as of 2/26), commercial paper spread, and S&amp;P 500 put-call ratio. But what I have right now seems to be sufficient enough to know that we are not headed for a severe market malfunctioning.

C**ombining all of those, I think it's more likely that we are going to see a deeper correction given the technical indicators but I have a very low conviction on this call and we can never time the bottom so my guess is just as good as yours. I do, however, have a higher conviction that we'll see a market recovery and it's wise to slowly buy into dip.** The best way to behave in a correction is to continue to monitor individual names and determine if they're cheap enough to buy or not.

**2) How to hedge yourself**

I should probably have posted this way before to prepare people for a correction like this and my apologies for it.

I will tell you how I try to hedge myself and this is something that works for me but it may not work for others because everyone's risk tolerance is different. Please keep that in mind when you are reading this.

Here's what I typically do. Please realize that this is a rough outline of what I do and by no means everyone should follow these steps.

📷

After a correction of more than 10%, I start buying into the selloff more aggressively. I may be trying to catch a falling knife but I'm willing to risk losing that money for the potential reward in a market recovery.

When the market breaks the previous high and rises a bit more, I start slowly hedging myself by buying short-term debit put spreads.

Here are instances where I bought the hedges.

📷

As you can see, my timing is terrible. I began buying the hedges more than 2 months before the actual corrections happened. As a result, I lost a substantial amount of money through hedges.

Specifically, this is the type of put spread I buy.

Long leg

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 5-10% lower than the current underlying

Short leg:

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 10-15% lower than the current underlying

The idea you are trying to express through the combo of these two legs is that I expect the markets to correct anywhere between 10-15% in the next two months.

If the market corrects more than 10%, I gain on the long. If the market corrects less than 15%, I gain on the short.

The reason why I like this spread more than outright naked puts, straddles, or covered calls is that it requires low capital, you can express your view on the markets better, and it is simpler than other strategies.

**I am no expert in options and I would like to keep things as simple and as easy to understand as possible.**

If you were to execute the said hedging strategy today, here's what I would buy. In fact, I bought this spread on 3/1 when QQQ was $320 and I still have it. I only bought it for no other reason than simply following the 5 steps outlined above.

📷

Long leg: 5/21/2021P $280 $7.67 ask price

Short leg: 5/21/2021P $260 $4.33 bid price

The net premium that I have to put up is $3.26.

It's cheaper than paying $7.67 to buy put option but still protects me just as much when QQQ drops.

This is the performance profile showing what happens today if QQQ moves +/- 10% today or by the expiration date (May 21st), from Interactive Brokers platform.

📷

You can see that if QQQ drops 5% today, I get $184.20 in gains and 10% drop gives me $420.24.

If QQQ is down by 10% by 4/7/2021 instead, a month later, then you gain $385.37 on this spread.

📷

Lastly, we gain $1666 if QQQ is down to $260 by the expiration date 5/21/2021 or lose the entire premium ($334, different from the above mentioned net premium because of mid-price convention) if QQQ is above $280.

📷

The scenarios sound pretty attractive to me. If I expected QQQ to drop from $300 today to $260 today (more than 10% correction), then this spread does a good job hedging. If QQQ closes above $280 (7% drawdown), I only lose $334.

**Now we know which spread to buy but how much should we buy?** The answer depends on how much of the portfolio you want to hedge.

There is a concept called a delta-neutral portfolio. This simply means that if you have a $100k in stocks, you have just as much in options that will offset any gains or losses, thus delta-neutralizing the portfolio.

For instance, look at the long leg we talked about before. 5/21/2021P $280.

📷

We can easily calculate what the ""Delta Dollar"" is for this put option.

You have a delta of -0.238, or -23.8%, and the underlying (QQQ) is $309.

$309 x -23.8% x 100 = -$7,354

Underlying price x delta x multiplier = delta dollar

In plain English, this means that buying the put option is equivalent to shorting $7,354 of QQQ.

So if you have $7,354 in QQQ, this put will make your portfolio delta-neutral. $7,354 in QQQ - $7,354 in put option = 0.

A 1% decline in QQQ will increase your put value by $73.5 (1% of the delta dollar) but will decrease your QQQ shares by $73.5 so it evens out.

As you can see, you gain $82.6 on your put option if QQQ declines by 1%, slightly different than the $73.5 we calculated because delta actually changes as the price of the underlying moves, which is a result of gamma but we won't get into that here and I will cover it in the later series.

📷

**The point is that buy as many spreads as you would like to delta neutralize your portfolio.**

If you are more bullish and only want to delta hedge only 50% of your portfolio, then you would buy enough number of spreads so that the total delta dollar equals 50% of your portfolio.

The good thing is that in most brokerages, there is a column called ""Delta Dollar"" that will calculate it for you, like the one below.

📷

This is not the longer one but the shorter QQQ put spread that I have and as you can see, it hedges $105,575 in dollar terms.

Please note the delta dollar changes every day based on the underlying price moves so if you are buying this spread, you have to frequently monitor the movements to make sure you are properly hedged.

**Summary**

Which leads me to my last point about hedging yourself.

I am a proponent of spending as little time as possible monitoring the markets because I would rather spend time understanding new companies, doing research, or learning some new trading strategy.

If you are buying short-term spreads, by definition you have to spend more time on trading so please keep that in mind.

The point of today's memo was to reiterate my thoughts on the markets and how to hedge yourself in tumultuous times like this.

The first reason I think is that people are greedy and once they see a stock move up 100% in 6 months, they get fomo and hop on when really they should not have done so. Then they realize the hype has died and we see a correction where now they are down 15% from ATH, which brings me to my next point.

The second reason is they PANIC. They see their investment loses 15% in a week and they realize they made a mistake. So they sell at a lost and move it to cash. Which brings me to my next point.

Third reason I believe is that they don’t have PATIENCE! If you are convicted that a stock is a strong company, then you have to ride it out and be patient. Strong companies usually will pull through unless they are in a fraudulent situation.

The biggest reasons, imo, are that people can just get greedy and get fomo then lose patience when their greed loses them money.

I see a lot of doom and gloom regarding what may be a coming market correction.

Do you think the elites/wealthy only make money in up markets?

&amp;nbsp;

I understand if youre currently in a stock and its value has dipped quite a bit over the last few days/weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

That can be concerning. 

&amp;nbsp;

However, history has shown us that over the longer term, solid companies generally recover and continue to climb.  

&amp;nbsp;

If you do have any cash on the sidelines or are thinking about taking a loss and trying to recover in other plays, there are ""options"".

&amp;nbsp;

The time may be upon us when it makes more sense to sell short, buy puts and scalp for short term gains.

And if there is a market correction specifically due to inflation, theres money to be made there as well.

328,sendokun,0.0,9.0,"The sharp rise in yield is due to significant expansion in scale of treasury auction while the market has not been able to adjust and keep pace. It’s a classic issue of short term surge in supply while demand is not able to expand at such quick pace. But there is a simple solution that has proven to work. 

The Fed can relax the calculation on bank’s required capital holding  (last utilized in April last year). The issue with the swing in yield is also largely driven by the fact that the scale of the auction has skyrocketed while the trading market itself has not kept pace. But the banks who buys these treasuries must hold them on the book, thus add to their required capital holding. In order for the bank to comply, they either have to increase capital holding or must unload these holdings from the books. This causes the banks to be forced to sell these bonds by increasing yield to avoid having to raise capital holding. So an easy fix would be for banks to be allowed to exclude these treasuries when calculating required capital. I mean, comparing to any other assets, these treasury holdings are about as safe as it gets. This way the bank does not have the pressure to unload these treasuries quickly thus helping to ease the pressure from the short term supply surge. 

I do think that if the yield continues to rise due to poor auction result, the fed will not act directly to intervene and will instead just reenact the temporary rule change on capital holding requirement. I think the fed has incentive to actually keep the yield in check, because it directly affects two things, stock market and housing which are both the largest wealth generator, retirement funding and household expense for most Americans.",stocks,Sharp rise in yield driven by short tedemand-supply imbalance.,9.0,0.92

I started doing my due diligence on a couple of Canadian stocks. While comparing numbers like 5 year growth estimates on yahoo finance, I noticed that the stocks being traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange TSE had a negative 5 YR projected growth, while the same stock on the NYSE had a positive 5 YR projected growth.

Personally, I've been buying as much of Canoo as I can. Using the proceeds from selling Covered Calls, I have been buying a bit of everything except for Tesla as I believe it to still be way too overvalued.

It's no doubt we are in a bit of an EV bubble, and some if not most of these companies and the others may not make it in the end.

Lucid, while have such a huge market cap with no real product yet...seems to have plenty of high powered investors in...namely Black rock and Saudi money

Arrival, another big name allegedly that has contracts with Amazon to build buses and delivery vans. 

Tesla....you guys already know.

Canoo, it's a bit of a weird one. Offering multiple vehicles from delivery vans, consumer subscription vans, trucks, sedans...and all using the same chassis or ""skateboard"".

Hyliion, they are attempting to take on the 18 wheeler market by offering hybrid EV trucks. While seemingly a competitor to Tesla's truck offering, their CEO does seem a bit.... Eccentric. But maybe it's not a bad thing.

However, since rising Treasury yields generally coincide with a growing economy, the lower equity risk premium is often offset by consumer demand etc driving up earnings and therefore share prices. But that boost isn't equally distributed throughout the market, so the rising bond market will affect some stocks more than others.

So there are two variables to consider: sensitivity to a rising bond market and gains from near term economic growth.

As I understand it, companies with valuations that are more heavily dependent on far future earnings will be most sensitive to interest rate hikes. That's because future cash flows have to be discounted more aggressively in an environment of rising Fed rates since it becomes more expensive to borrow money to make it to the horizon of profitability. So investors might be enticed away from growth stocks and into value stocks and increasingly profitable ""risk-free"" Treasuries.

So the big question is which stocks will be most sensitive to a rising bond market? Are there technical indicators you can use to determine a stock's sensitivity to a rising bond market? High P/E would seem suspect, for example...

The options greek ""Rho"" measures the price change for an option relative to the risk-free rate of interest... Is there something similar for stocks? That would be a freebie.

And of those sensitive-to-rising-bond-market stocks, which ones stand to benefit the least from a booming economy? That gives us our trim list.

Hi everyone (Strap in because this might be a long rollercoaster), Note: I rounded each cost per share to dollars only ($164.22 to $164)


I recently started investing due to WallStreetBets and this whole Gamestop saga but now I feel like an idiot who has a big problem. I created a Fidelity account (due to research on Robinhood and there issues in general) in December 2020 and bought 30 shares of Gamestop at $19 a share ($570 total). Then, in January 2021 as the stock was increasing and getting ready to go to the moon bit by bit, I bought 10 more shares for $38 ($380 total), 20 more shares for $78 ($1,560 total), then 3 more shares for $232 ($696 total), and then 2 more shares for $309 ($618 total); all for a total of 65 shares ($3,824 grand total cost). The day to the moon (or alpha centauri) finally came on January 25th, 2021, and when the trading halts happened with Robinhood and other brokerage firms as GME was exploding, my dumb ass didn't sell (people were telling me to as well) as I thought that the momentum would've continued after the halts and GME would've actually skyrocketed to thousands of dollars of share and I would've actually made some life changing money.


Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and I became a bagholder who watched the price fall down faster than humpty dumpty sitting on a wall and having a great big fall since. So, not even knowing how selling a stock works might I add (I thought that I could sell each stock I bought separately for a certain price), I started to paperhand and first sold 10 shares for $68 ($680 total) thinking that it was the 10 shares I bought for $38 a share ($380 total), but I guess it's just the 10 shares from the 65 shares I owned in general. Then, when the stock price got to $47 I really paperhanded and just sold the rest of my 55 shares ($2,585) for a loss in the first week of February as I thought this whole Gamestop saga was completely over, and I felt the weight of GME was finally off of my shoulders and I can invest the rest of the money in other stocks (especially penny stocks).


Then, out of nowhere, comes February 24th 2021, Ryan Cohen tweets a picture of an ice cream cone (which I guess maybe was a code to people, investors, etc that he will really change Gamestop for the better within the future), and a few hours later once again Gamestop Gamma Squeezes from $40 or $50 to almost or actually $200!!! Now, I know I'm an idiot, but, I actually rebought at least 10 shares a few days later this time around for $133 ($1,330 total) right before it dropped to $108, but when I looked at my positions on Fidelity it shows Gamestop as a wash sale and the average cost basis is now $164 ($1,640 total) a share. I actually freaked out and then did some research on what a wash sale is and I have a few questions:


1 I know that I won't be able to add the loss on taxes next year, but, do I need to pay taxes for the 10 shares that I sold for $68 a share.


2 Will the rest of the 55 shares that I sold be taxed, and how to include this wash sale for taxes in general.


3 Now that I have to make up for the loss, if, for instance, GME went up to $200 a share and I sold all 10 of my shares, would I actually profit the $360 ($2,000 - $1,640), and not have a washed sale if I buy GME shares again after profiting.


4 Now, how would this be included for taxes.


5 If I bought more shares now with the wash sale, will my avg cost basis increase even further than $164 a share


6 As for options, what would happen if I bought calls (or even puts) now even though I have a wash sale for rebuying shares at a loss.


To conclude this rollercoaster guys, If I knew about the wash sale rule before all of this I definitely wouldn't have sold for a loss at all and just held. As a matter of fact, if I knew the halts would've killed GME when it was just about to skyrocket I definitely would've sold when it reached $400 to $500 a share. If anyone is able these answer these questions, you have my absolute gratitude.

For example, they recommended buying Amazon still at north of $3K/share this month. In 2002-2003, they recommended buying it and it was $17 and it also split 7 times since that point. How would a ""wise investor"" still unquestionably buy that? Yes, it exploded 18000% but realistically will it reach north of $500,000/share? I guess it could, but seems highly unlikely.

Are there any recommended resources or methods to better explore and learn about startups, emerging IPO's, etc. that might be better bets for beginning investors willing to take a larger risk? Looking at market histories even 5 years back, there are MANY companies today north of $500/share that just years ago had periods of time that might have been south of $20/share.

Teva is grossly undervalued. The CEO restructured the company cutting all the dead weight in the last couple of years making it profitable while it’s making more billions in revenue than its current market cap. Teva is saving lives by making cheaper, generic product of expensive medicine that would otherwise not be affordable. Unlike other huge pharma companies already worth 100s of billions of dollars, Teva market cap is low by comparison with an extremely low P/E ratio and has potential to 10x in value. Unlike recent stocks that already increased 5000% in a couple months where people are fomoing in at the top, this ship has not sailed yet. Its price is the lowest it has been in decades so getting in now has lower risk but a huge upside.

The price right now is %80+ lower than all time high which was \~6 years ago. It has spent more time in the last 2 decades at more than double this price and is gravitating back to the 20-30 range in the near future, especially when considering inflation. Its last stock split was in 2004 where its price was around $28 and only increased in following years until 2016. Inflation since then till now is %40+, meaning if it kept up with inflation the price now should be at around $40 but it is available for $10.5. 

There is also a decent amount of shorts trying to keep the price down during this period of consolidation so people (and some huge investors) will lose interest and sell the bottom while the shorts can eventually load up their bags at such low prices on the way back up.

Some sectors have always performed better than others.

On the growth side, information technology and consumer discretionary have outperformed healthcare and even communications.  During downturns, they outperform even traditional utilities.

On the value side, financials is the star player.  Energy is in a secular decline.  ""Real estate"" is an underperformer because the bulk of this sector is commercial real estate, not the stuff of people's diversified income streams.

So instead of broad index investing, why not construct a three- or four-sector portfolio by market cap that consists of the above?

They hire experienced portfolio managers with lots of wisdom, analysts who have been researching and writing about stocks for years, and young hungry college grads that want to learn the business and contribute their energy. They formulate their strategy and buy stocks that are within the strategy’s guidelines. Within those guidelines, they do almost everything they can to make maximize profits (options, shorting, other derivatives). They make money on the downside of a stock by shorting it (borrowing and selling massive amounts of shares which drives the price down) and they make money on the upside by covering the short (buying the shares back cheaper) and buying more shares to profit because their large positions drive the market up. All the big institutions talk to each other, pay for high grade research services (Bloomberg) and hire statisticians and economists as well to gather more insight on where stocks and the market are going. Most of their actual trading is done by algorithms and computers which express their strategy and each move is carefully and quantitatively planned out (a farcry from how most retail investors invest). They build positions in stocks slowly so as not to disturb the price much (if it gets too high in the bidding process they lose on cost basis) and once they are in the positions they set multiple trailing stop losses and hedge the position every which way (put and call options, shorting, futures) so they aren’t killed in a downward move. These institutions like to invest in all the same companies together, because it provides some comfort and justification if the trades go wrong.

Institutions are more realistic in their investing than retail investors. They will jump in on an overhyped company KNOWING that it will crash one day soon, and set the appropriate stop losses to prevent losing out when that finally occurs. While we invest in a company because we believe in it and want to be in for the long term, they see one of their institutional buddies sell, and then they hit the sell button or their stop losses get triggered, sending the price to floor. Everyone runs for the exit. The stock’s price gets pounded down, and retail investors are left holding the bag because they believed in the company for real.

Institutions are not all knowing, and the majority of them will not beat the S&amp;P 500. They get burned on stocks, they take the wrong sides of bets, and they have no predictive insight when it comes to the macro economy at large.

All this said, at the end of the day, they move the market and we do not. We have to live with them because we depend on them for success (only they have the power to drive stock prices up by buying in large blocks). Whatever stocks we buy, we will never buy enough to actually affect the price. In summary, If they like our stock, we will succeed. If they hate our stock, we will fail.

I'm 24 years old and basically entered the market by self directing during the 2020 rebound.

A substantial part of my portfolio is made up of faily broad market funds like VGRO (Canadian), VOO and the likes.
But to cultivate my interest and increase my knowledge about investments, I made the decision last year to self manage about 40% into equities and pick companies.

 I made some great returns but during the last month, I realized I was heavily into growth tech and started to trim back to cash to rebalance. This coincided well with the fast drop of growth lately. Seeing what I perceived to be appetizing prices for stocks I liked I jumped back in Friday and while I went down a little bit I felt comfortable with the prices, but I then read a lot this weekend about the move toward value, the effect of inflation, etc and I am lost as I seem to find a lot of contradicting information about value vs growth, how they perform during bull or bear market and the effect of inflation on the stock prices. I need help to make sense of things.

1) Knowing the rebalancing of my portfolio will be done to diminish the time I spend monitoring the market with a 30 year time horizon but still being concerned about the immediate performance based on if I picked stocks at a good price, should value or growth be over represented?

I have found contradicting info about value vs growth in the sense that by a measure of long term, value seems to clearly outperform growth, unless you shrink the time horizon because since about the 1990s, growth has been outperforming value.

I've also found sources that say that value performs better during the rebound from a downturn (so is the move from growth to value we are seeing the market signaling the start of the real rebound? ).
 How value perform during the ""crash"" seems to vary. For the 2000 bubble it went well but the crash was mainly with growth stocks (tech). During 2008, many stocks considered like value performed worse (banks for exemple).

374,xsist,0.0,10.0,"Historically stocks have been considered a partial hedge against inflation. So with inflation on the horizon I thought it would be interesting to discuss the effects of inflation on the price of the S&amp;P 500.


1. Can we actually expect to see inflation rise?

The argument for inflation is pretty straight forward. Over the last few months we have seen an increase in government stimulus, with another $1.9 trillion added today. Meanwhile the pandemic has decreased spending. With the end to the pandemic coming into view this means that we could be looking at a near future where a population newly flush with cash all run out to buy things they have been putting off buying. In this scenario demand outpaces supply driving demand-pull inflation. This sentiment has been endorsed by the fed who generally believed to be a good sign for the economy.

So it does seem likely that we will see an increase in inflation. Though it's just a prediction, and we all know how those usually turn out.


2. What effect will rising inflation have on the price of the S&amp;P 500?

With rising inflation, buying power decreases. This means companies pay more to produce goods while consumer purchasing decreases due to lost buying power. Meanwhile bond yields tend to increase pulling money away from stocks. 

On the surface this seems like an open and shut case for inflation driving lower market returns. So then why are stocks traditionally considered a hedge against inflation?

The usual answer for this seems to be that companies balance sheets typically increase in proportion to inflation. Moreover the whole driving force for demand-pull inflation is increased demand resulting in companies raising prices and ultimately resulting in increased profits. 

So inflation is good for stock prices then? Didn't we all just agree it's bad?

The truth, like so many things in the market, seems to be that the effect of inflation on the market is inconsistent and depends on a great many more factors than just inflation itself. 

So reddit, what's your take? What factors do you think will influence the current pro-inflation market and what do you see as the outcome?

* ""potential to eventually impact an estimated $8 trillion in global sales on an annual basis and unlock its projected 630-fold growth in the next decade.""
* ""[autonomous driving] features the kind of benefits to road safety that may have policymakers eager to secure its widespread (and possibly mandatory) adoption.""
* ""... GM thinks it could be an estimated $8 trillion industry.""
* ""And the clock is ticking…because a software update I believe is due to be released in just two weeks could kick off “Phase 2!”""
* ""the median market cap of the ten stocks we’ve selected is 1/23rd the size of Tesla.""
* ""eight of the ten stocks in this strategy guide aren’t currently recommended anywhere else at The Motley Fool.""

Fool also gave 3 hints on the stocks it will reveal:

* ""The “Chinese Tesla” which made $535 million last year…in a fast-growing Chinese market which could grow to $330 billion""
* ""The under-the-radar stock we see as the “hands-down leader” in producing vehicle camera lenses, the eyes of any autonomous vehicle. A total necessity once “phase 2” kicks off – after all, if the car can’t see, how can it drive?""

### Get Started

This document attempts to describe a system that:

- Is cost effective and accessible for any range of income. 
- Incentivizes curiosity.
- Adapts to the investor that uses it or grows it.

Ultimately, what the following strategy written is a strategy knowing as “Focus Investing” which is a style that embraces volatility and rigorous decision-making.

The reason this document is written is because there are systems in place that allow for automated investments for as little as a dollar a month. That is an incredible tool that opens access to the markets from people’s pockets that otherwise would never be able to invest. The goal of the document is to guide an investor past two major beginner hurdles:

1. Investing in your first stock
2. Keeping your decision-making process under control

### TL;DR

The art of investing will always be based on the practice of making good decisions and the practice of maintaining the correct temperament through the good times and bad. You have to be comfortable missing out and you have to stay confident in a self-respecting strategy.


### The Setup

There are three primary components, so it will cost an investor as little as $3 a month. The automations that allow this to happen are:

- Monthly scheduled deposits
- Dividend re-investment
- Recurrent $1 ***daily***/weekly/monthly investments

The three components that work together in a step-by-step assembly-line:

- Save cash to be prepared for proper opportunities.
- Maintain a pool of sound and common sense ideas to control decisions(ETFs)
- Create a list of assets that feel as valuable as property such that initially purchasing and finally selling the asset is a time-consuming process.

My recommendation is the following on a recurring schedule:

1. Purchase $1 of your favorite company that you analyze rigorously.
2. Purchase $1 of SPY ETF to diversify
3. Hold cash to practice having saved cash for good opportunities.
4. Never allow yourself to hold more than 10 assets.

The reason that I recommend this setup is because you will inevitably have a million questions that may feel like they need to be answered. And often times you best choice is to not make a choice at all. Your goal, again, is to master the decision-making process and not the action of actually investing.

It is the nature of feeling uncertainty to ask many questions as a means to gain control, but truthfully, most of the best investments are often the most obvious ones in your respective expertise. An auto-mechanic that figured out to invest in Autozone and Home Depot is fundamentally as effective as a PhD engineer that invests in Tesla.

You are young. So take your time. Time will always be your most valuable asset, so use it and spend it wisely. 

My $720 setup is as follows, with each stock written about at length in my profile.

- $120 cash (waiting to invest in MOD Pizza and Impossible Foods)
- $120 split up into 30 sector-targeted stocks/ETFs
- $120 per asset (Autodesk, KSU, Pinterest, Square)

I’d like to start by recognizing the good things about Tesla. Tesla is the global leader in battery technology, vehicle software, supercharger network, and full self driving. Traditional automakers are so far behind Tesla that they don’t provide meaningful competition. As of today, I don’t believe Tesla is overvalued at its current price, $597.95. But it’s expensive. I believe in the company, but as someone with a 3-5 year time horizon I’m not buying it’s stock. I believe the downside risk is still big while the upside is limited. Here’s why. 

1. Execution risk. Tesla has a lot on its plate, from rapid expansion of manufacturing/logistics, R&amp;D costs for full self driving and world-best battery tech, new vehicle development, and doing something productive with a solar business which is dragging on the company. Not meeting lofty expectations in any of these will drag on the stock price.

2. Competition. I’m not worried about traditional car companies or upstart EV companies. What I’m worried about is Apple with iCar and Google with full self-driving. Apple is dangerous not because of car expertise, but because of their tech savvy and brand loyalty. Their competition is several years down the road, but very dangerous. And in case you were unaware, Google’s subsidiary Waymo which is considered the leader in autonomous driving tech is reportedly valued at $30 billion. Both Apple and Google can seriously jeopardize Tesla’s dominance in the EV market.

3. Elon Musk. Tesla’s stock price is largely a bet on the vision and drive of Elon Musk. However, Elon Musk has suggested in the past his goal with Tesla was to get the world to switch to EVs. Now it seems he’s succeeding in that, and if he steps down as CEO and focuses on his primary interests, space and hyperloop, I believe we will see a prolonged bear market in Tesla stock. 

I love Tesla as a company and I hope they prove me wrong. And I’d like to mention, even if my bear case plays out, Tesla will still be one of the most valuable companies in the world. But I wouldn’t be surprised if the stock price still hovers around $600 in 5 years (still a $573.9 billion market cap).

Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be talking about a pretty boring dividend payer: Quest Diagnostics. They've seen a good run-up during COVID and they showed up on a PE screener I ran recently, so I figured I'd check it out.

**Business**

Quest is the world's leading provider of diagnostics and testing. They actually end up serving about the equivalent of one-third of the American adult population every year which I find staggering. They've seen a spike in revenue (see revenues section for more detail) during COVID as they were the first actor in the testing space. Normally, I'd go into more detail by breaking down their various business segments, but Quest only operates in one segment so this section will end up being short.

**Growth Strategy**

[TTM Revenue 12/31/10 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/YYI1qTz)

As you can see, after 9 years of stagnation, Quest finally got a major pickup from COVID. Now, they have to take this opportunity to continue growing. They document some of these strategies in their recent 10K. To cut through the corporate jargon, I'll summarize the 4 points:

1. **Strategic Acquisitions:** Besides providing an opportunity to grow, acquisitions allow Quest to extend its footprint further. Personally, I think an attempt to break into foreign markets could be good if done right, however, this would be very difficult due to varying regulatory standards.
2. **Partnering with Others:** The idea here is simple. By partnering with health plans, IDNs, etc, they can increase market share and become a go-to provider for advanced diagnostics tests. They've been successful in implementing this thus far as evidenced by a 2020 Anthem partnership.
3. **Provide more Tests:** Nothing much to add here, it's pretty self-explanatory. By offering more solutions, they can drive growth through more facets.
4. **Increase usage of their consumer solutions:** Quest saw large growth in their QuestDirect platform. QuestDirect is a consumer-initiated testing platform. This means that you can order tests to do at home or a Quest Patient Center or you can ask questions online.

**Revenues**

[TTM Revenue 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/OU9lCd0)

Quest has grown revenue 22.12% YoY, 27.57% over the last 3 years, and 26.03% over the last 5. Just by looking at the chart, you can tell that a large portion of growth came from the pandemic, but quantifying that makes that fact even more apparent.

Moving to Net Income, you're met with the same story on a more drastic scale. YoY, Quest has increased net income by 66.28%. Quest has grown net income by 85.71% over the last 3 years and 101.41% in the last 5 years.

**Margins**

Quest currently has a net margin of 15.16%. This is encouraging compared to their historical margins. 3 years ago, their margin was 10.43% and 9.42% in 2015. Comparing that with its competitors, Labcorp has a net margin. of 11.13%, Buffett favorite Davita has a net margin of 6.70%, and Abbott had a net margin of 12.99%.

**Assets/Liabilities**

[Total Assets 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/OsVbxNQ)

[Total Liabilities 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/CHGjnJB)

As you can see, both Total Liabilities and Total Assets have increased about the same amount over the last 5 years. The only difference here is that they have significantly more assets than debt. They have a current Debt/Equity ratio of 0.59x and interest payments are well covered. To look a little deeper, subtracting long-term debt of 4.01B from total liabilities of 7.22B and we see that Quest has 3.21B in short-term liabilities. Quest only has 1.16B in Cash on Hand which means that there's 2.05B in short-term liabilities that aren't covered by cash. While this isn't amazing, it's expected and I would be very surprised if this wasn't the case.

**Free Cash Flow**

Quest has grown Free Cash Flow by 71.94% over the last 3 years and 184.41% over the last 5. This is promising as it implies they'll be able to continue dividend growth. Speaking of dividends....

**Dividends**

Quest currently pays a 1.92% annual dividend ($2.24 quarterly) which is well above the average health care dividend yield of 1.54%. On top of that, it's a consistent dividend. Quest has a 22.64% payout ratio and had grown its dividend for 9 years prior to COVID. They lowered their dividend 1-cent to $2.21 focus their capital on testing, however, they are back to growing with the next yield being $2.24, 2 cents above their previous highest yield in 2019.

Quest's next ex-dividend yield is April 6th.

**Price Ratios/Other**

This section aims to go over all of the relevant ratios and percentages that didn't fit anywhere else. I'll show the ratios on the chart below, and then I'll break them down.

&amp;#x200B;

|Ratio|Quest|Labcorp|DaVita|Abbott|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|11.20x|9.82x|14.32x|31.78x|&lt;15|
|P/B Ratio|2.29x|2.44x|7.25x|6.23x|&lt;2x|
|P/S Ratio|1.69x|1.67x|1.14x|6.05x|&lt;2x|
|P/FCF Ratio|10.05x|15.36x|9.55x|45.58x|&lt;15x|
|ROE|23.04%|19.47%|39.81%|19.37%|\&gt;20%|
|PM/RG Ratio (My personal creation)|0.58x|1.99x|30.73x|4.30x|&lt;2.5x|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for this sector may be under 15x. The problem is this number cannot be universally applied. While Abbott does supply testing solutions, they are also a supplier of drugs that has grown revenue significantly faster than others and have seen more consistent growth since their spin-off of Abbvie than many others in the testing space, including Quest.

That being said, Quest has the second-lowest PE in the testing space and looks pretty attractive from this angle.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 2. Other than Abbott, many testing providers have exhibited choppy growth and a temporary boost as a result of COVID, so I'd like to see them trading pretty low compared to book value. Interestingly, none of the major testing providers were below 2x. This could mean 1 of 2 things.

1. Many companies in the testing sector are overvalued compared to book value.
2. My P/B number was unreasonable and arbitrary.

I'm inclined to believe the latter, but I'd be interested to see what you guys think.

**P/S Ratio**

I said a good P/S Ratio was 2x (same as my P/B threshold), and this time, some companies actually qualified. In fact, most of them did with DaVita trading at a low 1.14x P/S Ratio, Labcorp coming in with a 1.67x P/S Ratio, and Quest coming in closet third at a good 1.69x. Overall, P/S Ratios look good all-around.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I'm pretty new to using this ratio, but I identified under 15x to be a good multiple. When I Google what a good p/fcf ratio is, the consensus is 20x, but since many of these companies have stagnating revenues, so I decided to hold them to a higher standard. The only two qualifiers here are DaVita and Quest with DaVita coming in at an impressive 9.55x and Quest coming in at a cool 10.05x. So far, these numbers are looking good for Quest.

**ROE**

I was looking for an ROE higher than 20% here, and we again saw Quest and DaVita being the only qualifiers with Quest coming in at 23.04% and DaVita producing an impressive 39.81% ROE. If you're going to have potentially stagnating revenues, you should really be good at efficiently generating capital, and that's what Quest is.

To break down Quest's ROE further, let's look at their historical ROEs:

|Quest Ratio|2010|2015|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ROE|18.51%|15.73%|16.10%|14.05%|15.47%|23.04%|

Looking at this chart, we're told a different story. Quest historically never broke 20%, it was only because of COVID that they recently broke through. That means that next year (2022), we could see a return to 15-16% ROEs. Let's compare this trend with DaVita's historical numbers:

|DaVita Ratio|2010|2015|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ROE|17.82%|5.17%|12.98%|3.70%|24.65%|39.63%|

While it looks like DaVita had an ROE of above 20% before COVID, this drastic 2019 move can be attributed to UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of DaVita, not an improvement in the underlying business.

The takeaway here is that these high ROEs are likely temporary, and they will go back to historical levels once COVID is no longer a threat.

**PM/RG**

This is a ratio I thought of myself this last week and I'm excited to see what you guys think of it. I wanted to find a ratio that could measure how rational price movements were, however, I couldn't find one. I ended up creating a pretty simple ratio to measure it. While I may change it up in the future, I think it works for now.

The Ratio works by dividing the price percentage movement over some period by the revenue percentage movement over the same period. So, for example, if ABC's price went up by 50% over the last year and their revenues only went up by 25%, they'd have a PM/RG of 2x.

I decided to measure price and revenue movements from 1/1/2020 -&gt; now. I put an ideal PM/RG ratio down as being &lt;2.5x. Normally, I'd want to see it be under 2x, however, since testing stocks have been a big beneficiary of COVID, I decided to give a little more leeway. The only two companies that qualified here were Labcorp and Quest. Labcorp had a PM/RG of 1.99x and Quest 0.58x.

I'm very surprised with Quest's PM/RG. They only appreciated 58% compared to revenue. To me, this could be a *potential* indicator that Quest has been undervalued by the market.

**DCF Valuation**

Assuming a -1% 5yr Revenue CAGR, an 8% Discount Rate, a 22.4% EBITDA Margin, and a Terminal Revenue Multiplier of 3.8x, Quest's fair value is $188.48 (a 59.8% upside from the current price of $117.96). Let's go over some other scenarios to give ourselves a range.

**Bullish Valuation**

I think I find it highly unlikely Quest will be able to capitalize on the recent increase in revenues to continue growing, but that'll be what I'm assuming in this scenario.

With a 1.5% Revenue CAGR, an 7% Discount Rate, a 22.4% EBITDA Margin, and a Terminal Revenue Multiplier of 3.8x, Quest has an implied Fair Value of $225.89 (91.5% upside from the current price of $117.96).

Again, this scenario is **VERY** improbable, but I figured I'd include it just for an idea of the theoretical max FV.

**Bearish Valuation**

I'd peg this as unlikely, but plausible.

Assuming a 5yr Revenue CAGR of -2.5%, a 9% discount rate, a 20% EBITDA Margin, and a 3.5x Terminal Revenue Multiplier, Quest has a Fair Value of $151.86 (28.7% Upside from the current price of $117.96).

**PE Valuation**

I use the PE Valuation as a way to sanity check my DCF Fair Value. Using an average 1 year PE of 14.51x and a current TTM EPS of $10.47, we get a Fair Value of $167.83 (43.10% Upside from the current price of $117.96). As we can see, the PE Valuation is pretty in line with the DCF Valuation we came up with above.

**Risks**

1. **Regulation:** A large part of the Biden Administration's agenda was based on making healthcare more affordable. While it could be all talk, the Democrats having majority control of the Senate and the House make any regulation Biden proposes is fairly likely to be passed. This could drive down profitability throughout the Healthcare sector.
2. **Competition:** This is going to be a risk no matter what sector you're in. There are a lot of large testing providers, so there's always a chance margins are driven down by a competitor's more effective and cheaper test.
3. **Failure to produce new tests:** The title is pretty self-explanatory. If Quest stops being able to license and create new tests, their revenue growth will slow/stop. The FDA being overwhelmed by COVID treatment/vaccine cases could make this risk a reality.
4. **Failure to defend IP:** If Quest fails to protect their Intellectual Property and they lose the rights to exclusively market their tests, competition will be driving down margins more aggressively than before.

**Conclusion**

I'm bullish on Quest. They're significantly undervalued and even with declining revenues being assumed over the next 5 years, they're still trading &gt;35% below Fair Value. Compared to competitors, they've appreciated very little and their safe dividend makes this a good long-term hold.

People are saying this confidently, as if it's a measurable fact, and that it's continuing to occur.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this makes sense I guess since growth (EV, tech, etc) stocks have been hitting ATHs as well as highly prospective (read: overvalued) valuations, so seems like a good time to pull out. COVID recovery seems to be in swing, and prospects of reopening are good (barring any real scare with new variants). This seems to mean that value stocks, which are dependent on the economy rolling at a normal pace again, will be more viable with expected production (and therefore earnings and stock price increase). Fair enough.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't understand is that people are *still* saying there is an ongoing rotation away from tech and toward value stocks. HOWEVER - it's been three weeks of bleeding profits in these growth industries! Why would any self-respecting hedge funds, investment banks, whatever companies invest tons of money, wait a few weeks to redistribute their wealth like this after taking so many losses? No way they line up taking turns 'company 1 gets to pull out first, company 2 gets next highest profits next week' and so on until the red-headed stepchild company gets to pull out last. Also, I can't see that, among all large investment institutions, that some would have significantly better information or whatever to be able to pull out first and time it correctly (I imagine we're assuming that the investment redistribution we're talking about is primarily the large investing institutions with millions/billions invested). I'd expect this kind of investment redistribution to take place quickly, maybe over the course of a week - not have half the companies wait until much of the losses have already hit before they pull out and lose the prospective gains in the industries they want to invest in before they bought in.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I look at it, and clearly I probably need some clarification. **When people reference general events like 'rotating investments from growth to value stocks', what is the mechanism of action? What kind of metrics/markers/data can you view and justifiably verify this claim? Why didn't we see this happen quickly? Why do people think it's still going on if huge investors would have to lose a lot of unrealized gains at this point by waiting weeks to pull out when they should know better?**

&amp;#x200B;

403,Redditor45643335,0.0,144.0,"I know many people had money during 2020, saw the crash but thought it was going lower so they didn't buy in. Then when it started going up they still didn't buy because they missed the bottom or they became convinced a second crash was coming and the lows would be revisited and they'll have their chance to buy.

Well we know how that turned out.. they might just be thinking this recent correction is *the* infamous second crash they've been predicting all these months.

I know there's a lot of uncertainty going on in the markets recently and you'll find plenty of doom and gloom stock market articles on the internet if you look for them.. You might be looking at this recent correction combined with reading doom and gloom headlines and gleefully rubbing your hands thinking to yourself ""I knew my time would come, now I just need to wait a little bit more and then I'll buy, probably close to the bottom"".

But this will almost certainly be a terrible mistake, and it would be the same terrible mistake you made last time. I get it, psychologically you want to buy at the cheapest possible price so you get the biggest return AND you lower your downside loss potential. It's very attractive and the temptation to try and time the market sucks you in, you become so fixated on not losing money and buying the cheapest price that you end up never making money either because you never pluck up the courage to actually buy in the first place.


---

I have a friend who pulled his money out of the S&amp;P in 2008 at around the 1000 point market (a 30% loss) to try and buy in lower, and while the market did in fact go lower, he was unable to time the bottom because he waited too long and was too greedy. To this day he still has not bought back in... Not because he thinks the price is going back to 1000, but because he is so bitter that he made this mistake he just cannot bring himself to pay the now 250% - 300% increased price.

At first he waited, then he waited some more and after a few years he lost interest because the price was so much higher than when he sold, especially when the price went past the previous ATH, he completely gave up on the stock market as being a viable investment and instead put his money in a savings account. I've not seen or spoken to him for a few years but I know him, there's no way he would have bought into the market, he was too bitter.


So what's the moral of this story / rant? Don't be like my old friend... Don't try to time the bottom. Don't be greedy. Just accept the discount that's on offer and buy in, then if it drops more, buy some more using your salary. Because if you don't, you're very likely to be stuck in the perpetual cycle of waiting for a correction that you end up inevitably missing the timing anyway. 


And I know there are some people who will read this, or posts like it, and they'll tell themselves they are right and they can time the bottom but however strong your conviction, just know that you are almost certainly going to miss the bottom, so why bother trying?",stocks,"If you were one of those people who sat on the sides throughout 2020 because you missed the bottom, do not make the same mistake twice!",144.0,0.92

I was looking at NUSI as a potentially good retirement fund. Gives a monthly dividend totalling 8.5% a year, so essentially 18c per stock per month, and is hedged against risk.


So now, let's say you want approximately 2K net income per month to live, but that also increases with inflation (2K today may be ok, but in 30 years it surely won't be).


This means you would need approximately 11K Nusi stocks in order to provide a 2K$ dividend per month.


Then, the stock itself is increasing faster than inflation, meaning it's most likely safe in the long term.

1000 x $3 per share = $3,000 paid

I don't know a single kid who does not play it and it has a viral effect because when one kid plays it their friends all start playing it together.

Some of my biggest trades have been on companies like BB, PLTR, and KMPH. All of which have received fantastic news, had great fundamentals, and at times even positive trending technicals. Yet the price has rarely reflected any of that if at all.

I understand that it’s usually due to a sort of market correction, given that the whole GME fiasco essentially created a sort of hyperinflation on a plethora of small-medium cap stocks and what we’re seeing at the moment is those prices come back down to reality.

430,mfairview,0.0,9.0,"Weed companies have been pulling back the last couple of weeks after the majority saw new highs in Feb.  Time to revisit the ONLY LP that is actually cashflow and net income positive with ER a week away.

&amp;#x200B;

First, OCS, the largest weed market in Canada, puts out quarterly stats and for their 3rd Quarter (Oct-Dec 2020), Pure Sunfarms was #1 again in their largest selling category, Dry Flowers.  Capturing 13% of both online and retail.  That's up 1% from the prior quarter.  Retail stores sold 128M dried flower in the prior quarter and PSF was top dog.  OCS is expected to open another 100+ stores this year so VFF will benefit heavily in the growth.  see: [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2636/1928/files/Final-OCS-InsightsReport\_Q3-2020.pdf?v=1614968675](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2636/1928/files/Final-OCS-InsightsReport_Q3-2020.pdf?v=1614968675)

&amp;#x200B;

Second, OCS is only capturing 40% of the total cannabis market with 60% of the revs coming from the illicit market.  They have been gaining traction quarterly starting with only 5% share when they started back in 2018.  There's still lots of real estate left to capture.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, VFF earnings is on Tuesday 3/16 and numbers are looking to be up 40% qoq.  They should absolutely crush yoy since last year was their pivot from wholesale to retail and, thus, was abysmal. Q1 should also be solid with edibles being recently introduced in February and it'll be the first quarter where they own 100% of PSF (sale was consummated in Nov 2020)

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, their market cap is sitting at around 1.2B.  Compare this to their peers:

\- ACB (2.11B) - buying wholesale from VFF

\- CGC (13.3B) - buying wholesale from VFF

\- CRON (3.76B) - buying wholesale from VFF

\- APHA (5.71B)

\- TLRY (4.18B)

Note all the LP's above ARE STILL LOSING money.  Don't get fooled with ""adjusted"" ebitda numbers.  No LP is as operationally competent as VFF who is growing cannabis in the 0.40-0.50/g and all in cost at around .60/g.  The nearest competitor is around 2x that number.

Lot's have been said in the past so I'll just ref a few links for your research but make no doubt this company is killing it and will continue to kill it in weed since they are first and foremost farmers with vast experience in growing, own 10M sq ft of greenhouse in BC and TX, have another 12M sq ft with JVs in Canada, US, and Mexico, established distribution centers, and have existing contracts with all the big box stores: Walmart, Wholefoods, Trader Joes, Loblaw, Safeway, Target, etc.

This DD is about VFF – Village Farms International, a company in the Cannabis industry based in Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

Credit where credit is due (u/mfairview), I was originally introduced to this company by a DD on r/WallStreetBets (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld6zoc/village\_farms\_international\_vff/). I know I know – WSB is a casino! However, you can certainly find diamonds in there outside of those associated with hands. This isn’t a moon shot, this is a long term play, and thanks u/mfairview for the introduction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before we get started, a little about this stoned ape to give my background and better portray the perspective I am approaching this from: I have years of broad experience across various Operational/Supply Chain functions (Warehousing, Procurement, Demand and Supply Planning, Transportation/Distribution, Last Mile Delivery \[direct-to-consumer\], Logistics, Manufacturing, etc.) in multiple industries, mainly CPG. With that background and an education in Supply Chain Management, I consider myself a decent evaluator of the basics of a company – operational capabilities and basic financials. That is the main view from which I will be approaching this DD.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to more technical investing considerations and context regarding the overall stock market, I am lacking in the same depth of knowledge. I have been lightly investing for years, and only heavily got into it last March/April. Since then I have had some wins and learned some hard lessons, but am not knowledgeable enough to speak to these types of considerations. Hopefully someone else may be able to provide a follow-up to this initial analysis that goes further into this area.

I look forward to feedback and learning from the comments, I would greatly appreciate constructive criticism and to see other perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

Village Farms International

* Year of Origin: 1987
* Country of Origin: Canada
* Industry: Cannabis / Produce

&amp;#x200B;

Village Farms International has been operating for 34 years, during which time they have become a roughly $200M revenue per year company (last 5 years) that has become a leader in North American greenhouse cultivation footprint (access to 23.7M square ft. of grow space) and expertise. This started with a focus on produce products (namely tomatoes), and led to a core competency built around large scale greenhouse management. Over the last few years beginning in 2018, Village Farms has seized the initiative to take advantage of their vast knowledge in greenhouse operations and enter the budding cannabis industry.

&amp;#x200B;

They initially entered the industry in a joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics called Pure Sunfarms. They have since bought the ownership stake from Emerald (in the last 2 months) and now have full ownership and control over Pure Sunfarms, with Pure Sunfarms CEO Mandesh Dosanjh reporting to Village Farms CEO Michael DeGiglio.

&amp;#x200B;

Cannabis operations timeline:

* May 2018: Began commercial production
* Sept 2018: Began Wholesale sales
* Sept 2019: Began Retail sales in Ontario
* Oct 2019: Began Retail sales in British Columbia
* Feb 2020: Began Retail sales in Alberta
* July 2020: Began Retail sales in Manitoba and Saskatchewan

&amp;#x200B;

By 2019, the company’s annual revenue of $206.9M had was made up of $62.3M from Pure Sunfarms cannabis sales. Cannabis has already become 30% of their business and that will only continue to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Unique competitive advantages:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Steady, experienced, and consistent leadership

* Their founder and CEO Michael DeGiglio has been leading the company since its inception in 1987, and their CFO Stephen Ruffini has been with them since 2009
* This executive team has been together for a long time and they intimately know their company, talent, and resources
* I consider this a temporary competitive advantage as many cannabis companies are currently developing and growing with new executives and employees from various backgrounds and experiences who may not have worked together before. This is not necessarily a slight and some companies will thrive from that environment, but generally it will take time for those organizations to develop the same level of operational synergies, expertise, and mission-focused cultures that Village Farms has had decades to cultivate

&amp;#x200B;

2. Decades of greenhouse grow experience

* Wealth of data / experience in collecting/tracking and applying plant yield data, which is a critical aspect of improving supply availability and quality for Cannabis companies (and any agricultural business)
* Head start on clean energy initiatives – most competitors are just trying to get plants in the ground and get revenue streams growing, their ability to fully embrace more advanced initiatives such as clean energy are likely years away
* This is not only socially and environmentally responsible, but can save on costs, and improve public opinion while opening doors to new partnerships with commercial customers who have stringent vendor requirements around energy consumption
* Already NA leader in grow space available with preexisting infrastructure, significant head start vs. competitors

&amp;#x200B;

3. Somewhat more protected from regulation/industry specific fears than their peers

* Revenue stream from original produce lines provides a safety floor of revenue
* While this provides a floor, when we look at their potential revenue growth soon, it will show that this floor is only really a good safety net now, and their growth will soon make revenue driven by legacy produce products a very small portion of their business
* Decades of experiencing navigating international trade, regulatory laws around food for multiple countries, etc. This experience will benefit them greatly compared to their peers in the cannabis industry who are brand new to this part of the game

&amp;#x200B;

4. Existing Retail relationships

* While they are building their own stores as well, their history suggests they will mainly position themselves to sell goods wholesale to other Retailers
* Existing partnerships with Walmart, Kroger, Publix, Costco, Albertsons, and more
* I’m not necessarily suggesting to expect Cannabis to be sold in those specific chains when Cannabis becomes legal in the US, but in years to come as federal legalization occurs in the US and the industry evolves to where you can buy Cannabis outside of specialized dispensaries, it may become more like alcohol (with varying laws by state, existence of dispensaries, product in Retail chains, and brewery-type experiences available as well)
* That existing experience and capability in developing, establishing, and maintaining relationships with major partners like those listed will benefit them even if the chains they have preexisting relationships with aren’t the major players in this category

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential obstacles/pitfalls:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transitioning identity of the company

* It can be a major, disruptive challenge to revolutionize the operational strategy and revenue drivers of a business
* Legacy employees may not be cut out as well for the new environment, or there can be frontline cultural resistance from employees in the field against the suits in the offices who are making these decisions
* You run the risk of alienating your legacy customers
* This can be worse if your main customers are not consumers but instead other companies, as is the case with Village Farms
* In that scenario, it is more likely that a small portion of your customers make up a significant portion of your revenue (the Pareto Principle), and disruption to some key customers would be a massive impact to revenue
* The best CEOs would position this as something along the lines of: “We have always had the objective of utilizing state of the art agriculture operations to deliver value to people’s lives through fresh and healthy organic products, and whether that is tomatoes, cucumbers, or cannabis, that is what we will continue to do.”

&amp;#x200B;

2. Competition in the industry

* 507+ federal license holders for Cannabis operations in Canada alone
* US MSOs (Multi State Operators) are not going to roll over and give up market share without a fight
* Behind on overall public awareness to companies like Trulieve, Tilray, and others

&amp;#x200B;

3. Overextending expansion efforts and compromising position in legacy markets

&amp;#x200B;

4. Not enough senior leadership with significant Cannabis experience/expertise

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My rebuttals to the listed pitfalls, in respective order:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. We are three years into the transition of this company, and if this obstacle was going to be a show stopper, I believe it would already have had its negative impact

* The recent play to purchase out Emerald and get a 100% stake in Pure Sunfarms was the last domino to fall on this concern for me as I researched the company. Their industry leading cost positions, aggressive expansion plans, and rapid rise in cannabis related revenue has displayed that they have not only pivoted their product portfolio successfully, but done so without disrupting the core capabilities of the company

&amp;#x200B;

2. This is a concern and there are Cannabis players who will not make it to the finish line, but there is a lot of room for specialization in this industry just like any other. 

* The global revenue growth potential for the industry is extreme and there is plenty of room for those who now how to position themselves well
* While this risk/concern may impact Village Farm more in some markets than others, especially as they aim to expand and increase the amount of competitors they are exposed to, their core business in Canada alone is already sufficiently impressive to be worth an investment opportunity by itself. More on that to come

&amp;#x200B;

3. This is a real risk that cannot just be explained away easily

* This is a company that can handle scale and complexity based on its 34 year track record and industry leading position in North America Cultivation space. There are still significant risks and capital investments required to expand in this industry, especially given the current regulatory state around the world
* As one example, expanding into Texas alone will require standing up a vertically integrated end-to-end business within that state alone, with uncertainty as to the timeline of exactly when and how the medical program will expand and eventually go fully adult use legal
* If the expansion of the Texas medical program expected later this year is not as wide ranging as anticipated, and/or the introduction of fully legal adult use legislation in the market takes many years to come, that will make the high operating expenses and fixed costs of this market a weight on the company’s overall P&amp;L until revenues and the ROI break even within the state
* Furthermore, there’s no guarantee their business competes as successfully as they’ve operated in Canada regardless of legislative impact
* And that was all just conjecture about Texas, not even mentioning Europe and Asia Pacific expansion plans
* This potential pitfall is the risk that concerns me the most

&amp;#x200B;

4. This does not concern me, as experienced business leaders can apply the same principles that drive success in one industry to another. Subject matter expertise certainly is important, but it isn’t the end all be all, there are different styles. Some senior executives are experts of their industry/product/service and lean on that expertise to be great leaders, others are experts in general business principles and good at listening to the industry/product/service experts who work for them, among other types of leadership philosophies. This leadership team makes up for what they lack in prior Cannabis expertise with agricultural expertise which is critical to this industry. I do understand if this is a larger concern for some, though I want to address a bit further why it is not for me, at the risk of redundancy:

* Consumer packaged goods are consumer packaged goods and commodities are commodities. Knowing your product, your target customers and demographics, your industry, and a myriad of other marketing/commercial considerations I could additionally mention are obviously critically important to success
* Even so, the most important aspects of leading a large modern business revolve around universal concepts that apply to all products/services and industries: fiscal responsibility, operational discipline, and clear value positioning/commercial strategy. Some companies do okay without those attributes as core competencies. I’m sure some even flourish – revolutionary products and visions can overcome many hurdles. But no company can rely on that for long term stability – guaranteeing continued revolutionary advances is by definition not possible, and revolutionary vision is generally derived from specific individuals. People leave companies. People die. Relying on revolutionary products or visions is not a successful strategy for true long term stability
* If you can create a fiscally responsible and operationally disciplined environment /organizational infrastructure within your business and partner it with revolutionary products or vision - you have an Amazon or an Apple. Village Farms International WILL NOT BE an Amazon or an Apple. Cannabis is a commodity (granted, a commodity that is benefiting from extreme growth due to emerging from essentially global prohibition) and if they had revolutionary vision, I’d imagine there would be more articles about Michael DeGiglio as an individual that I would have come across in my research (no disrespect intended - I’m sure he’s a swell guy and very intelligent given his resume and achievements)
* Based on my research, I believe this company has a clear understanding of its value positioning and commercial strategy, as well as the aforementioned and critical capabilities of fiscal responsibility and operational discipline. I will support these claims in the next section

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Outlook:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The main objective of publicly traded companies is to provide/increase shareholder value. The main way that is achieved is by increasing profit, although for companies in the growth category, increasing revenue can be more important in the growth phase to institutions and investors (see: Amazon for many years). To put it more simply, the three areas a company must focus on to provide/increase shareholder value are as follows, with a summary of my perspective on Village Farm International’s outlook for each area, with context:

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - Domestic**

* Most important metric for stock price over next couple years given growth industry status
* Stated goal from 1/21 investor presentation (link in references): “Goal to capture 20% market share in dried cannabis category and have #1 or #2 brand market share in each product category”
* “Dried cannabis”, or flower category, is the largest product category in the industry and made up \~33% of all US Cannabis sales in 2020 (as one example benchmark), so between that and their also ambitious targets for other categories, will use 20% market share target as a representative goal of theirs for the overall Canadian market

  

|**Year**|**Canadian Market Revenue (C$)**|**Pure Sunfarms Actual Revenue (C$)**|**Pure Sunfarms Target Revenue (C$) (20% MS)**|**Notes**|

\*Made up market forecast based on growing (with diminishing annual growth) from 2020 actuals to the 2025 market projection from BDS Analytics

&amp;#x200B;

* VFF market share from 2019 in Canada around 7%
* Based on the 7% actual and the 20% target, as well as BDS Analytics Canadian cannabis market projection for 2025, estimated 2025 revenues for Pure Sunfarms would be a range between $360M if market share remains flat to $1B if 20% market share is achieved
* That alone represents a range of 74% to 383% revenue growth versus total company 2019 revenue (growth measured from 2019 to 2025)
* Keep in mind that’s in Canada alone, ignoring expansion activity, AND ignoring revenue from their legacy produce business!
* Yes that’s a lot of growth potential, and this is a company that has the demonstrated experience and capability to handle that scale profitably (more on that in next section)

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - International expansion**

US

* Texas presence already established
* Not going to go into speculation here, but this is a massive potential market that is likely to expand its medical program significantly by the end of 2021
* Some articles in reference list below for those interested

Europe

* Ownership stake in DutchCanGrow in the Netherlands

Asia-Pacific

* Already operating in Hong Kong
* Targeting further expansion in China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and more
* Targeting expansion into at least 3 more countries in the region by end of 2021

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - Define value position and execute**

The core principles of the cannabis arm of the business are listed by the company as follows:

* The leading supplier of greenhouse grown produce in North America
* A producer of the highest quality product, which adheres to the highest food safety standards
* A low cost producer
* A daily supplier to customers
* A provider of excellence in customer service and logistics
* A business with a solid balance sheet
* Enhancing investor value through continual improvements in execution
* An employer with a dynamic environment in which employees can grow and prosper

&amp;#x200B;

They directly speak to building their value proposition on the main competencies we’ve already discussed: “low cost provider”, “continual improvements in execution”, “solid balance sheet”, “excellence in customer service and logistics”

* These are not sexy principles compared to a lot of the flash in a new industry like this, but they are proven winning principles
* Village Farms aims to be closer to a Walmart than a Nordstrom, and its own self awareness of how to best leverage and position its experience and resources is a sign of solid leadership and direction
* Village Farms will win on volume, scale, and efficiency, not marketing and pricing

&amp;#x200B;

**Increase Operational Productivity/Scalability (for various ops processes: decrease lead times, increase outputs, decrease labor requirements, etc)**

* Take advantage of historical competencies and economies of scale
* Greenhouse grow is their bread and butter, they are already at the cutting edge of cost management and productivity/efficiency for this industry. It may not be a permanent competitive advantage and competitors can catch up, but it provides a great head start and attracts partners

&amp;#x200B;

**Minimize Costs (procurement/purchasing pricing, inventory costs, labor costs, etc.)**

* Supporting above revenue growth will take significantly less new capital investment compared to competitors due to existing infrastructure
* Already have industry leading gross margin, per 1/21 investor deck (40%), as well as industry leading profitability
* Already lowest cost producer of flower among Canadian greenhouse/indoor growers
* Currently riding 7 consecutive quarters of positive net income and 8 consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Takeaways:**

I’m not going to speculate on stock value targets, I’m not a financial analyst and this isn’t financial advice. I like the company, and to quote DFV, I like the stock. I believe the company has strong fundamentals from an operational perspective. I want to invest in the success I believe this company will have, and I believe it will provide a significant ROI. I do not believe that all the growth the cannabis industry can and will experience is priced in to current valuations (although I would love to see other thoughts on that).

&amp;#x200B;

The stock price could go up in the short, middle, or long term. It could go down. Heck, it could even stay flat.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know, Jon Snow knows nothing, this isn’t financial advice, and I’m just a stoned monkey. I plan on holding for the foreseeable future (most likely years, while buying the dips) barring any unlikely circumstances (any of the discussed obstacles/pitfalls manifest in a critically damaging way, the company exits the industry and returns to focusing on its roots in produce, Michael DeGiglio besmirches Harrison Ford in any way, or something of the like).

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t a get rich quick target, this isn’t a moonshot, and this isn’t without risk. There will be ups and downs over the years, as this is still an industry that is very vulnerable to market fears and herd mentality impacting stock values significantly, regardless of underlying fundamentals. This is an investment play, a long term hold, a “trust the process” play. This industry has amazing global growth potential, it will stabilize eventually, but on the path there, the Greenfield expansion/Brownfield acquisition&amp;merger growth phase of this industry will shake out many of its less fundamentally sound players. As players shake out, as regulatory fears continue to be stoked, and other similar phenomena occur, there will be value fluctuations and there will be investors who get spooked and lose money. Don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. Don’t invest what you may need access to in an emergency. And don’t put your mental health at risk.

&amp;#x200B;

In an emerging industry that is rampant with companies tangled up in financial mismanagement, short term cash grabs at the cost of sound long term decision making, regulatory hurdles, and lack of defined strategic direction, Village Farms looks to be a potential sleeping giant. As the chips fall globally over the next 5-10 years within the Cannabis industry, companies will emerge that will become titans. While Village Farms may not ever be the most popular or well known consumer-facing cannabis business, it looks well positioned to carve out a valuable niche in the industry and create a lot of value.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the industry long term, I like the company long term, and I like the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: This DD and the assumptions involved are derived from high level information obtainable on the internet. I have never done business with this company, I have never been to Canada, and I don’t particularly like tomatoes (my apologies to the many tomato lovers I am sure I have disappointed, though I do like ketchup). The realities of the underlying assumptions may be very off base. Customer experience and product quality could be lacking, my assumptions regarding the more technical/market-based considerations may be incredibly naïve (or even flat out stupid), and I may truly be a stoned ape just banging his head against the keyboard.

433,thinkB4WeSpeak,0.0,8.0,"Citing “a strong economic recovery with robust freight demand,” less-than-truckload carrier Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) announced Thursday plans to add 800 drivers and more than 400 dockworkers and clerical personnel.

The Thomasville, North Carolina-based company said it was looking to add Class A CDL drivers over the next three months to meet growing demand. The plans include hiring 275 linehaul drivers, 260 pickup and delivery drivers and 100 team drivers. It will also add more than 430 workers on its docks over the same time period.

Average pay for new linehaul drivers will be $99,000, with pickup and delivery drivers earning $73,000 annually. The full-time, nonunion positions also offer health insurance, 401(k) and paid vacation. Old Dominion will pay a $5,000 signing bonus for qualified drivers in certain locations.

“Our OD people are the heart of our operations and we’re looking to add to our workforce in response to a growing demand for our premium service,” said Marty Freeman, EVP and COO at Old Dominion. “There’s never been a better time to consider a career in transportation. These career opportunities offer a great work-life balance, a competitive compensation package, on-the-job training and career advancement opportunity.”


Old Dominion’s announcement comes as the carrier is executing a terminal expansion plan, which produced nine new or expanded facilities in 2020. Similar additions are planned for 2021. The facility expansion is part of the company’s efforts to increase market share in a favorable trucking environment.

On Tuesday, the carrier announced that year-over-year trends in February (revenue +9.2%) slowed from more robust growth seen in January (revenue +14.6%). Severe winter storms were noted as the reason for the deceleration in the growth rate. Even with the slowdown, the carrier fared better than others in the month.

Saia (NASDAQ: SAIA) reported a 2.3% year-over-year decline in February tonnage after posting a 5.4% increase in January. The company said roughly 70 terminals were fully or partially offline for several days during the month.

ArcBest Corp. (NASDAQ: ARCB) reported flat tonnage through the first two months of the year in its asset-based segment as February wiped out a 6.6% year-over-year increase to start the year.

The selling from this correction is likely over now. May get a couple of dry heaves next week but the heavy selling (-3+% in a given day is likely done). I am waiting to see at least two days of stability in the next week or two. For example, a Green Day like Friday is not stable. Yes it was up which is good, but far from showing footing.

I believe that as the market digests this quick uptick in yields we will settle in and stocks will grind higher towards retesting highs in some names. Many of the momentum names that had eye popping speculative valuations likely won’t be back to highs this year as folks are spooked.

Highs on solid names will be retested by mid May / early June timing as optimism around economy heating up (double edged sword here) and vaccine rollout continues to build. As things reopen I believe the economy is going to run way too hot and inflation will pick up more than expected. I don’t think the fed will have to do anything drastic but the realization that the economy is overheating will cause additional pressure on certain equity valuations yet again. To me, if we retest highs in May I think there is substantially more risk to the downside (10-15% correction again) than to the upside (4-5%)

Once we get within 1-2% of highs in May I will be building back to roughly 1/3-1/5 cash in my trading portfolio. 

Hope all of you have some dry powder around and are able to pick up some really solid companies that went on sale in the last week or two!

In this piece, I’ll argue why CAPEX should be swapped out with Depreciation. I welcome your critiques and thoughts.

CAPEX are the investments companies make for growth. Depreciation is the cost to maintain previous investments.

So by taking Operating Cash Flow less Depreciation it gives a better sense of the extra cash generated from the business because growing the business is a choice, not a required expense. Depreciation is required to maintain existing investments.

With this tweaked definition it leaves the company with 4 options with their adjusted FCF:

1. Reinvest (CAPEX)
2. Buyback stock
3. Pay dividends 
4. Pay down debt

# **Stocks face the crosscurrents of higher interest rates and fiscal stimulus in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/stocks-face-the-crosscurrents-of-higher-interest-rates-and-fiscal-stimulus-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Covid-19 aid package is on track for final congressional approval in the week ahead — and it could be a double-edged sword for markets.
*****
&gt; The legislation should be greeted by optimism around the powerful lift it could give the stock market and the economy, but it could also be met with concern about what a historically large stimulus package could do to inflation and interest rates.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 higher, but the Nasdaq was dragged lower by interest rate-sensitive tech names. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to press higher, revisiting its recent high of 1.61% on Friday, before trading at 1.54% in late trading. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; One wild card for stocks could be how interest rates behave around upcoming Treasury auctions.
*****
&gt; There is a $38 billion 10-year auction on Wednesday and a $24 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Traders are watching these closely, after a historically weak 7-year Treasury note auction in February sent rates higher, even for the 10-year.
*****
&gt; “We’re a little more cautious on them, just given what we saw in the 7-year and some Japanese selling pressure,” said Ben Jeffery, strategist on the U.S. rates strategy team at BMO Capital Markets.
*****
&gt; He said Japanese institutions could be less interested in participating before the end of their fiscal year on March 31.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus coming
The Senate was expected to approve its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package and send it to the House for a vote during the week. Otherwise, the market is watching key inflation reports with the consumer price index expected Wednesday and the producer price index, scheduled for Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think the markets will be watching closely the progress on the stimulus package,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I think they’ll continue to watch the 10-year Treasury move and we’re going to get CPI data. That’s going to inform on those moves.”
*****
&gt; He expects stimulus to remain a factor that could sway markets.
*****
&gt; Inflation has been a worry for markets, since rising inflation could crush margins and corrode earnings power. For bond investors, it would erode value and make interest payments worth less.
*****
&gt; “As long as the rise in Treasury yields matches the pick-up in inflation, I think the market will be able to handle that. I think the challenge is when yields get notably above inflation...I like to see them closely matched,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; He said the market is concerned that the next stimulus package could overheat the economy and create inflation, particularly as it comes on the heels of the package approved in December.
*****
&gt; “I think it lends to the conversation, ‘do you really need another $1.9 trillion?’ Arone said. “We’re going to pour more gas on the fire, and with this $1.9 trillion that’s what the market is concerned about.”
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation is expected to remain somewhat muted for February, after the 1.4% rise year-over-year in core CPI in January. But the pace of inflation is likely to pick up notably in March and April, since the comparisons to last year, when the economy was shut down, will likely look extreme.
*****
&gt; # Choppy to continue
&gt; Strategists expect the push-pull between interest rates and stocks to continue.
*****
&gt; On Friday, rates were higher after a strong February jobs report and stocks were also higher. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, about 160,000 more than expected.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think 1.5%, 1.6% on the 10-year is terribly troublesome for the market,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She said the speed of the move was troubling.
*****
&gt; The rotation out of tech and growth into more cyclical names in the financial, energy and industrial sectors continued in the past week.
*****
&gt; Energy was up more than 10% with oil prices, which were at a near two-year high. Financials saw the next strongest move, gaining 4.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re in a choppy consolidation phase,” said Sonders.
*****
&gt; “You’re seeing some extreme historical spreads between what energy and financials are doing recently versus tech and consumer discretionary,” she said.
*****
&gt; Sonders added that even if the consolidation phase is close to ending, that suggests there could be more downside for some frothy names. “The good news here is I think it’s becoming a better environment for active stock pickers,” she said.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 10%, as of Thursday from its Feb. 12 high. But on Friday, the index turned around, gaining about 1.6%. That’s a positive sign for the market, particularly since it happened as rates moved higher.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.8%. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was down 2%.
*****
&gt; “I think ultimately the higher quality segments that got hit in tech and communications probably did need to see a valuation reweighting,” Sonders said. “Arguably, we had some micro bubbles in the market, and they may need to suffer more downside.”
*****
&gt; She said investors may want to adjust the allocation of their holdings regularly instead of waiting to adjustments around the calendar
*****
&gt; “If you get a two three week, four five day surge in a particular sector, pare some back,” Sonders said, nothing that’s the opposite of what most people do.

&gt; # Jobs Market Gets Reopening Boost

&gt; US payrolls grew at a solid clip month over month in February, as progress in the vaccine distribution process appeared to boost growth by enabling more of the economy to reopen. Our opinion has always been that until we have achieved widespread vaccine distribution, the in-person segments of the labor market will be slow to recover losses from a year ago. We are becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect for a 2021 economic reacceleration, and we are heartened that the hardest hit segments of the jobs market may be beginning to reflect that view.

&gt; The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added 379,000 jobs in February, exceeding Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ forecasts for a 200,000 gain. Large seasonal adjustments to the data did serve to boost the overall number by roughly 140,000, while January’s jobs gain was revised significantly higher from 49,000 to 166,000. Colder weather than normal may have also played some role, though the worst of the freeze experienced by middle America occurred just after the report’s observation window closed. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3%, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate of 61.4%.

&gt; “Last month on jobs day, we noted our optimism around an improving trajectory for vaccinations and the implications that may have for future jobs reports,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This has played out so far, and we expect continued vaccination progress to become more evident in the jobs numbers as the recovery reaccelerates.”

&gt; Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month over month and 5.3% year over year, continuing to signal that lower-wage workers have endured the worst of the pandemic’s job losses. Inflation expectations have been in particular focus for the market lately, however inflation risks from a tightening labor market are not of major concern for now in our opinion. We expect overall average hourly earnings to remain steady or even reverse as lower wage workers are rehired in service sector jobs, and we still have lots of slack in the labor market as we hover well below 2020’s peak employment.

&gt; The composition of February’s report importantly signals a reversal of COVID-19-driven trends seen in recent months. Retail trade gained 41,100 jobs while the leisure and hospitably industry gained 355,000—two segments that have been hardest hit throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, professional and business services added 63,000 jobs and government jobs fell by 86,000.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the jobs recovery in the leisure and hospitality sector has generally plateaued following an initial bounce. This segment of the labor market is highly dependent on in-person interaction, and has understandably suffered in a work-from-home environment. Unsurprisingly, service sector jobs have strongly correlated with broader trends in COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality sector alone still accounts for about 3.5 million of the 9.5 million jobs lost compared to the February 2020 peak. And while we do caution against reading too far into one month’s numbers, we are excited to see this decimated sector tick notably higher in February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We have not had to look hard to find evidence that vaccines are having an impact. Nationally, seven-day averages for new cases have fallen to below early 2020 peaks, significantly below the highs of late 2020. Perhaps most crucially, the portion of the population most vulnerable to severe symptoms has largely already received at least one dose of the vaccination. A third vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in March, and this week President Biden estimated we would have enough supply of vaccinations to cover every adult by the end of May 2021. Once people can become comfortable with the virus trends, we expect widespread hiring in in-person industries to snowball quickly. February may have signaled a start to this trend.

&gt; # Anatomy of a Bond Market Sell-off

&gt; Coming into 2021, one of our higher-conviction ideas was that we would see rising long-term interest rates in the United States; it’s one of the reasons we recommended suitable investors consider an underweight to interest rate sensitive fixed income. However, we didn’t expect interest rates to move this high, this fast. The 10-Year Treasury yield started the year at 0.91% and ended the month of February at 1.41%, down from an intraday high of 1.61%. As such, core fixed income assets are off to one of their worst starts ever (remember that as yields go up, prices go down).

&gt; “Core fixed income assets aren’t off to a very good start this year, but we don’t think investors should abandon high-quality fixed income assets as they play an important role in a diversified portfolio” says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; **So what is driving interest rates higher? Changing expectations**

&gt; Inflation and growth expectations are important factors into the fundamental outlook for interest rates. Broadly speaking, what we’ve seen in the bond market this year is a re-pricing of both higher inflation and higher growth expectations. Inflation expectations have steadily moved higher, and market-based gauges of inflation expectations are the highest they’ve been since 2011. We don’t expect much higher inflation expectations from here, but we are watching how additional fiscal stimulus flows into the economy. Additionally, it seems increasing economic growth expectations have picked up recently as well. An increase in growth expectations may put pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from its low interest rate policy sooner than expected, which has put upward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields.

&gt; An unfortunate byproduct of those higher expectations is that we’ve seen an increase in the volatility of the 10-Year Treasury. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, daily percentage changes for the 10-Year Treasury yield are above historical norms (each vertical line on the chart represents the one day percentage change in the 10-Year Treasury yield). As shown, over the past several months, yields have regularly moved 10-20% in either direction on any given day. We think this is due to the changing interest rate dynamic and believe that interest rate volatility will subside the further we get into this new interest rate regime.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Seasonal Pattern Suggests Weakness Likely Ending Soon

&gt; In the above chart we have plotted five different S&amp;P 500 seasonal patterns along side 2021 through today’s close. “All Years 1949-2020” and “All Years 1988-2020” represent longer-term and mid-term baseline patterns. “All Post-Election Years” includes every year that was a post-presidential-election year regardless of outcome. “1St Year Democratic President” applies to this post-election year and so does “Post-Election Year After Incumbent Party Loss.”

&gt; When comparing 2021 to these various past seasonal patterns, this year’s performance is above average, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently experiencing some of the weakness present in the other five patterns. Historical weakness (shaded in light blue) is most visible in the three post-election year patterns in February lasting until early to mid-March depending on the post-election year pattern. All three historical post-election year patterns suggest that current weakness could be ending soon.

&gt; # Historic Surge for the Energy Sector

&gt; The energy sector has certainly been on a wild ride over the course of the past year, perhaps the wildest of all of the S&amp;P 500 sectors. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 caused such a demand shock that oil futures traded for a negative value for the first time in history, implying that someone would pay you to take delivery of their oil!

&gt; Well, that’s in the rear-view mirror for the energy market now. Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is up over 29% as of March 2, according to data from FactSet, more than double the return of the financial sector, the second strongest sector thus far in 2021. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is trading at a blistering 30% above its 200-day moving average, the most ever using data back to 1990. While this might seem bearish on the surface, previous surges above 20% have historically bought above average returns over the next year rather than below average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The case can be made that energy could be a bit stretched in the near-term, but momentum often breeds more momentum,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Energy has been unloved for quite some time, but we may be in the early innings of a larger rally for the energy sector as the global economy continues to improve.”

&gt; A confluence of events may be spurring the boom in the energy sector. An expanding global economy, a historic winter storm that shut down major oil producing states like Texas and Oklahoma, and an output agreement from members of OPEC+ have sent oil prices soaring to their highest level since early 2019. It’s not just oil, either. Copper and lumber have surged past their 2019 highs as well. It’s no secret that inflation expectations have been on the rise, and the surge in commodity prices are likely adding further credence to the market’s view of higher inflation.

&gt; We have continued to warm up to the energy sector, including upgrading our view on oil in January and then our upgrade from negative to neutral in our February Global Portfolio Strategy publication.

This confirmed the skepticism I have always had with stock market. In the 90s too, small long term investors like me gained very little over the decade, as whatever rises the share prices had made, were usually wiped out by one crisis after another.

In fact, I, myself have seen only a gain of less than 15% in last 16 months. Since I entered the market first time in December 2019, the market has seen a deep crash, which I was totally unprepared for and then whatever recovery and gain I made has all been almost wiped out in the past couple of weeks. And all this, despite investing very carefully and diligently, analyzing so many parameters using the tools available in many websites like Morningstar, [Etf.com](https://Etf.com), finviz.com etc.

Recent events (GME for example) also suggest that stock market is actually a game between rich big investors or hedge funds. The market is heavily manipulated by them, whenever they like, while we, the tiny insignificant investors are just pawns to them.

Hence it makes me think if it's really worth being in the stock market. Investing and risking all your hard earned money, going through all the emotional roller-coaster, only to be manipulated by others and see so little gains.

Hence, I'd like to ask experienced ordinary retail traders of /r/stocks, Did these thoughts and observations never come to your mind? What's your perspective on this skepticism I'm going through?",stocks,Is it really worth staying in stock market as an average non-significant retail trader when the stock market is heavily manipulated?,21.0,0.63

I hope everyone has recovered from the last few weeks and had a good Friday.

444,lgm1213,0.0,3.0,"So I read that the instantaneous price of a stock is determined by the last successful ask and bid offers to be tallied e.g. (person A bids $1.00 for 1 share of ABC company and person B was asking for $1.00 to unload 1 share of ABC, there for it makes a complete order and the price is validated at $1.00)


This got me thinking and since I don't know much at all about how the instantaneous price of a share is calculated by the exchanges I'd figure This would be a good place to ask.

If this is how it works, is it possible to raise the price of any given ticker by having a massive amount of ppl buying 1 share per lot during a given period of time. (E.g. Person A wants to buy 1000 shares but only entered market orders for 1 share and just sat there clicking away adding 1 to their position in a loop till they reached 1000 plus other ppl doing the same thing with similar quantities)


I'd appreciate some real thought on this if I'm on the right or wrong path in my thinking. I'm not smart at all and might be full of it completely

445,ShubhamG77,0.0,780.0,"The following is my summary of Cathie Wood’s thoughts on recent market volatility, as presented in her latest video on the Ark Invest YouTube channel (\~42 min) – I strongly recommend you check it out.

The minimum expected rate of return for a stock to enter an ark portfolio is 15% CAGR. Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.

She mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&amp;p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs “are a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.”

She reiterates that “we are not in a bubble” – and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as “creative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&amp;p500”.

To Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that ‘real growth is going to pick up’ – and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn’t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.

Rotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where ‘too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon’. Energy and financial sectors booming will likely be short lived as they are both ripe for massive disruption.",stocks,“We are not in a bubble” – Cathie Wood,780.0,0.86

Fast forward to early March.

I  own somewhere between 5-250 shares in a shit ton of stocks. Random  stocks. Think around 50 different companies. There's only a few that  I've (lazily) researched and actually believe in. Yes this was a  mistake. I should have done research first and then bought, but I'm more  of a jump in first and then learn how to swim person. I don't mind the  monetary losses. I can make those back up if I'm patient. And I have  nothing but time (I'm not selling any of my stocks until they turn green  again).

So far I've spent around 15k.

The  problem is this: each week I hear about a new stock that is 'hot' (not  meme stocks, I'm careful around those, but stocks that are often talked  about, such as OSTK, EDP, OXY...). I immediately want to buy it. This'll  lead to more shares in more companies I have to keep track of... which I  really don't want, but those stocks, at the current low prices, are so,  so enticing. I want to buy them all and see what grows!

The problem then is twofold:

1. I've  bought a lot of random stocks that I'd rather not have (but don't want  to sell at a loss). A lot of my money is tied up in them now because of  that.
2. I  want to buy stocks that I actually believe have potential... but I'm  out of spend-able money at this point! I've already used my credit card  once and I'm kind of scared where this is going because credit card  using is not good. I shouldn't be investing borrowed money.

So  reddit, do you have any tips on how to stop chasing the next SHINY  stock? I keep jumping around, some of my stock purchases were plain  stupid, a lot of stocks I think have actual value are currently out of  my reach to buy unless I stretch my credit card. Theoretically, I can do  that because I'll be getting a pretty high bonus in two weeks (salary  payout date), but it's still a shitty plan.

Every venture capitalist is starting to offload as many stocks as possible to the public market. Celebrities start SPACs. Companys losing money since 20 years launch their IPOs.

Thanks to TINA, easy FED policies and BTFD the IPO window is currently open as wide as it can be.

The problem IMHO: this becomes a self re-inforcing tsumani of new equities: the higher the market goes the faster it accelerates, like a nuclear chain reaction.

If you can create a company for USD 1B and sell it to the market for USD 5B this is a great business. Then you take e.g. USD 2B off the table and create two new companies for USD 1B each, rinse and repeat.

453,_bono983,0.0,426.0,"""Tesla and  founder Elon Musk are renowned for notching firsts. In 2012, the EV-maker unveiled the first-ever premium all-electric sedan, the Model S. Six years later, Musk’s SpaceX launched the world’s most powerful rocket, the Falcon Heavy. That milestone marked another first, since the Falcon carried the Tesla Roadster into space, making the pioneering EV the first auto ever to orbit the Earth.

Recently, Musk has set supersonic financial records. Tesla’s moonshot from a market cap of $30 billion in mid-April of last year to $849 billion on Jan. 26 dwarfs the leap of any other young comer on the rise in a nine-month span. By early January, Tesla’s rise had lifted Musk’s net worth to $185 billion, placing the Tesla founder on a new pedestal as the world’s richest person.

Musk just achieved a new financial first––for the stock losing the most value ever in a brief period. Since that late January peak, Tesla’s valuation has cratered by 36%, dropping by $305 billion to $544 billion at mid-morning on March 5, as its shares tumbled from $883 to $566. No company in the annals of equity markets has ever dropped on a scale remotely that big in just five and a half weeks. Tesla’s $300 billion–plus descent exceeds the market caps of all but the 16 most valuable companies in the S&amp;P 500. Tesla dropped by far more than twice the combined market caps of Ford and General Motors, and by $100 billion more than that of the world’s second most valuable automaker, Toyota.

It may reassure Tesla bulls that it’s been a highly volatile stock in the past: It has seen big drops and then always recovered to shoot beyond previous peaks. From mid-February to mid-March of last year, it shed half its value and in the first two weeks of September, fell 34%, only to roar back on both occasions. The September slump shaved $186 billion from its valuation, but Tesla got it all back, and $400 billion more in the months ahead. Sure, you’ll hear, Tesla will suffer big bumps along the way, but its long-term trajectory will trace a sharp upward climb.
Still, the 34% decline means that Tesla’s shares need to rebound 56% to regain their old peak of $883 (and valuation of $849 billion). Overnight, investors decided that Tesla will earn a lot less than they foresaw as recently as late January.

What’s driving Tesla’s big pullback?

Let’s assume shareholders will want at least a 10% annual return in exchange for what can be counted on as a wild ride. To get there as of late January, Tesla needed to be worth $2.2 trillion by early 2031. At a premium price-to-earnings multiple of 30, Tesla would be generating $73 billion in yearly GAAP net earnings. That’s $5 billion more than Apple, by far the biggest profit spinner in the S&amp;P, made last year.

Now, shareholders have lowered the bar––but that bar remains dauntingly high. Using the same formula, the bogey is now $1.44 trillion 10 years from now, and earnings would need to reach $48 billion. To get there, Tesla’s 2020 profits of $721 million have to grow at an annual pace of around 50%.
That Tesla suffered such a huge fall, so fast, highlights the extreme uncertainty in assessing what it’s really worth. In reality, investors have little or no idea how much Tesla will earn in the future. Will the number be $60 billion in 2031 or $10 billion, something lower than that or something in between? Making any reasonable estimate requires so many assumptions that the exercise is futile. What remains is a super-sexy product, a charismatic CEO, a cult following, and a great narrative. What also remains is a still-giant valuation that can only go higher if great numbers start coming in, and fast. Otherwise, Tesla is sitting on an air pocket whose deflation would set new records unlikely ever to be equaled.""

What Is a Dead Cat Bounce?
A dead cat bounce is a temporary, short-lived recovery of asset prices from a prolonged decline or a bear market that is followed by the continuation of the downtrend. Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery—or small rallies—during which prices temporarily rise.

The name ""dead cat bounce"" is based on the notion that even a dead cat will bounce if it falls far enough and fast enough. It is an example of a sucker's rally.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
A dead cat bounce is a short-lived and often sharp rally that occurs within a secular downtrend, or one that is unsupported by fundamentals that is reversed by price movement to the downside.
In technical analysis, a dead cat bounce is considered to be a continuation pattern, where at first the bounce may appear to be a reversal of the prevailing trend, but it is quickly followed by a continuation of the downward price move. 
Dead cat bounce patterns are usually only realized after the fact and are difficult to identify in real-time.",stocks,Dead Cat Bounce,4.0,0.59
462,The_Cataclyx,0.0,7.0,"Hello internet, here's a little context to my request. If you want to get to the meat and potatoes of the request, skip this paragraph. I am a young lad who's getting a grip on his finances. I've decided to start investing, but my young age has me, well, inexperienced. I was planning on opening an brokerage account when I turned 18, but covid had majorly impacted my financial situation from what I had foreseen it to be. So, half a year later, here I am, motivated to start by the GME short squeeze. Having taken a (shortened) semester in highschool where I learned a little about stocks and investments, I've decided that since I'm young and not financially independent to invest in stocks I have a strong feeling are going to grow continually over the years. One of my first thoughts was Amazon, and so with the $20 I had before getting a job I invested about $10 of it into Amazon. 
That investment has since flopped, because as soon as I made the investment, Bezos decided to step down as CEO. actually, this move had been coming for a long time it seems based on a few reddit posts here, one of them dating back to 5 months ago. This experience has taught me to do more research before investing, a valuable lesson to learn. So, now that I have a part time job and nothing to spend the money on, I'm looking at expanding my portfolio. Particularly within my investments in Amazon. 

Even though the CEO transition has plummeted the stock, I firmly believe Andy Jassy will be a strong CEO and that Amazon will recover and begin to regrow. Now, my question is when. My first thought was to look at the history. When has a large tech company changed CEOs, and how long did it take for the stock to recover? So, I looked at Apple. then I got confused. from the looks of it, when Tim Cook took over as CEO of Apple, the stock didn't drop. Why? I'm hoping someone more experienced who might have been invested in Apple at the time could explain to me why the stock didn't drop. Was Steve Job's illness already bringing down Apple's stock growth, and so hearing of a new CEO actually boosted the stock because the public believed Tim Cook would make a good ceo? why isn't this the case with Andy Jassy, who from what I can gather has been the lead of Amazon's most profitable division practically since the beginning? What is the difference between these situations??? Or perhaps, maybe I'm looking at the Apple stock from too macro of a perspective? in which case, how micro do I have to go to see how long it took for their stock to stop dropping and go back up? Apple is only the first of businesses I want to look at who've had CEO transitions – as I know it's important to take multiple examples into consideration when looking for a historical trend – but it's leaving me stumped. I want to invest more into Amazon, but I want to do it at the right time. right now, $AMZN is at the one of the two lowest points it's been at over the last 6 months, and I expect that low to continue to dip, but I'm not sure how long. Any suggestions? Should I invest pieces at every small dip? If so, what percent of my investable money should I invest at each dip? this decision I would make based on the historical trend of stocks' behaviors following CEO shifts, but again, the one I'm looking at ($AAPL) seems to not... make sense. Maybe I should look to different companies for examples? if so, which ones? I'm young and haven't been around long enough to know what tech companies have done this besides Apple. I'm also unsure of what resources I could look into to help me figure out a trend. Anything an experienced investor could offer me would be tremendously appreciated.


TL;DR $AMZN has been dropping since Andy Jassy has taken over, presumably out of concern that he won't lead the company as successfully as Bezos did. Why didn't this concern apply to Tim Cook when he took over as CEO of Apple?  What other companies can I look at to get an idea of stocks' behaviors following a CEO transition?  I'm curious because I want to buy $AMZN at a low price, and so I want to ""see"" (guess/hypothesize) how long $AMZN will sink based on what history has shown. Of course, covid and stuff makes this a very unique situation too, so perhaps it's not even worth finding a historical trend? I'm new to investing and know that I should be investing safely and wisely, but I don't have the experience to determine what would be safe and wise.",stocks,"$AMZN drops as Andy Jassy takes over as CEO, what does history say about when to invest in the dip?

So I have landed a solid job in my career and finally have money to invest in. I’m going to be playing with stocks alittle, but I’m also planning to build a solid nest egg out of a long term index-based fund. After tons of research, I’ve narrowed down my top 3 to be (in order):

VTI (Vanguard Total Market)

IVV (iShares S&amp;P 500)

VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500)

My main criteria were low expense ratios (these are all at 0.03%), stability, and longevity. I like VTI more than VOO because VOO wasn’t started until 2010, so it’s lifetime yield isn’t a good comparison since it missed the 08-09 crash. VTI has slightly better gains than IVV over its lifetime, but IVV has had better short-term growth. IVV and VOO also had better dividend yields.

My brain is honestly fried going over all the numbers and I just want to know if it really matters all that much which of the three I choose. Is VTI a good investment over the other two? Is there a better long-term fund I haven’t listed? Any advice is welcome, I’m just trying to make the smart move.

Edit: I’ve gotten great advice so far, thank you very much, but people need to stop spamming Ark etfs. You clearly didn’t read the low expense ratio part.

First,  I do apologize if this has been asked many times or if this post is  inappropriate. Im fairly new to trading and investing (I got in during  the meme stock craze and I'm now simply trying to recover from my loss  which I'm happy to report that I am so far successful in doing so bit by  bit)

I know that being a 1 month  trader I am in no way ready to delve into the world of options but I  would still like to learn them for pure education purposes.

So I have some basic understanding of options and I have begun to learn more about the concept of covered calls:

Say  I purchase 100 of Stock X at 10 dollars per share. I would then sell a  covered call for a premium of 1 dollar expiring on 12/3/21 at a strike  price of 12 dollars.

From my understanding and hence my questions:

1. Would  the ONLY risk of selling a covered call be the opportunity cost of me  potentially earning more if say the stock went above 12 dollars? From  that standpoint, won't it be that from a bank balance perspective I  would have made 100 dollars at the very least no matter what?
2. Say  it has gone beyond 12/3/21 as per my example above, does that mean that  since my contract has expired, I would not need to rebuy my covered  call?
3. If  I have sold the covered call, would the premium be immediately cashed  into my brokerage account or would I have to wait for it to expire  first?

The sell-off comes amidst a bigger drawback in tech stocks, which are valued based on the presumption of heavy growth in future cash flows.

Competition and parts shortages are also playing a part.

Shares in Tesla were down as much as 8% Friday morning. They’ve since recovered to finish down -3.78% as markets showed a dramatic bounceback late on Friday, but the stock has still lost more than 15% of its value the year, and finished below $600 for the first time since Dec. 4.

FED FEARS 

On Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that “upward pressure on prices” and “transitory increases in inflation” might be coming to the U.S. as the economy reopens following a year of Covid restrictions that hit businesses across the board.

The market is now worried that interest rates will climb, and the feds won’t take aggressive policy actions or even be able to control it. Bond yields are surging.

This is causing a broader correction in tech stocks, which are valued based on the presumption of heavy growth in future cash flows. As inflation goes up, the value of those future cash flows declines. As CNBC previously reported, the Nasdaq 100 list of the largest 100 non-financial stocks on the exchange, is down about 8% from historic highs reached three weeks ago.
This is affecting most tech giants. For instance, Apple dropped from approximately $129 to $121 year-to-date, and Netflix has dropped from around $523 to $516. But Tesla’s drop is more precipitous, so far.

Bulls acknowledge competition

Some of Tesla’s biggest and most vocal backers have cashed out a chunk of their shares, and begun to acknowledge the onslaught of electric vehicle competition as a real challenge to Tesla at long last.

For example, Ron Baron sold 1.7 million worth of Tesla shares and invested in two of the company’s biggest potential rivals, GM-owned Cruise and Amazon-backed Rivian, while paradoxically saying he expects Tesla shares to rise, eventually, to $2,000.
Former Tesla board member Steve Westly said on CNBC’s Power Lunch this week that while he remains bullish, “Tesla is not going to be king of the hill in electric forever.” He added, “They’re getting competition from all sectors. They’re going to have to double down to compete.”
Indeed, automakers including Ford and Volkswagen have seen early success with sales of their electric vehicles including the Mach E and ID.3 up against Tesla models in the US and Europe.
Meanwhile, forthcoming EV’s, including the all electric version of Ford’s F-150, the Lucid Air, Rivian’s electric SUVs and trucks, and others are stirring excitement. Just yesterday, Porsche showed off the production version of its Taycan Cross Turismo, and said it would start sales in the US this summer. It’s a $90,000 EV wagon, a more affordable, practical take on Porsche’s performance EV, the Taycan.


Part shortages

Semiconductor shortages have caused most auto makers to temporarily close some lines at their factories, and Tesla is no exception.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the company’s Fremont, California, plant shut down temporarily due to “parts shortages” in a tweet on February 25. He said it was shut down for just two days, but did not make clear whether partial shut-downs on some lines would continue.
Tesla had previously warned, in its Q4 2020 earnings call and filing, that chip shortages could hamper their vehicle production goals in the first half of 2021.
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said on the call with investors, that for the first quarter of 2021:
″[Model] S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly re-architected products. Additionally, we are working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage as well as port capacity which may have a temporary impact.”
If Tesla does not produce a high volume of vehicles, due to parts shortages or lag times shipping parts from overseas to its U.S. plants, the company would not generate as many regulatory credits that it wants to. Tesla sells these environmental credits to other automakers, which is how it has historically achieved profitability.


Steeper expenses

Controlling costs has been on CEO Elon Musk’s mind on and off for years.
In December 2020, he wrote in e-mail to all Tesla employees: “Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that’s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!”
But at the same time, Tesla is on an expansion tear that will cost it handsomely. The EV maker is building factories in Austin, Texas, in Brandenburg, Germany and expanding its footprint in China. It has also embarked on revamping aspects of its Fremont facilities, including the paint shop, the area of the factory where its cars are painted.
Musk also has ambitions for Tesla to mine its own lithium, domestically. And to ramp up production of Tesla’s own battery cells at a pilot plant also in Fremont.
Besides these efforts, the company is in the midst of costly recalls and could face more-- whether voluntary or mandatory. Most significantly of these voluntary recalls, in China and in the US, Tesla is recalling Model S and X vehicles experiencing touchscreen display failures.""

For the past decade of working/investing, I basically only held what I considered “safe” stocks based on advice from my conservative investing friends/family. I have owned JNJ, T, ABBV, etc. I also bought and held stocks like GE and MO near their “highs” but they have had big downturns and even 5+ years later have never recovered. 

Fast forward to 2021, I have accumulated some more savings and decide I would like to begin investing a portion of my individual portfolio a bit more aggressively. While I understand the gains from 2020 are unrealistic long term, my hope were for more aggressive investing with 10-20% yearly gains.

While I did not “put more than I can afford to lose”, I decided to invest in ARKG because I am personally fascinated by genomics and believe their impact on health can be transformative but I don’t know much about the individual companies. I also bought into a few other similar speculative stocks (such as Tesla because I personally like that they’re doing).  I understand speculative plays have more risk, but obviously did not expect the market/these securities to begin tanking literally days after I bought, placing me essentially at their ATH. Unlucky.

Many people have referenced a “zoomed out” view of the market showing what happens over time in the market and that even big crashes will eventually recover. However, what about the people that truly bought at the ATH? I hear everyone bringing up points that “ARK is still up 100% since last year even with the recent 30% drop”. But that doesn’t do much for people that bought at the top and are only seeing the 30% drop.

My question to the more seasoned investors is what makes you believe people in these situations ever truly recover? In my own history, I bought companies I thought there “well established boring long play” companies like GE and MO and when they went down, it never came back even 6-7 years later.

480,MentalValueFund,0.0,493.0,"*FYI This is going to cover some very fundamental stuff that I'm sure a lot of you already know, however since there's plenty of casuals and new joiners, I figured it might be worthwhile to give a primer on.*

Here's a simple question: **What is a stock worth right now and why?**

There's lots of ways to answer this question, many (revenue multiples, earnings multiples, etc) are short hand or simplified ways of describing the same thing.

The foundation of modern finance answers this with: **The Present Value of all Future Cash Flows**

Regardless of whether you're talking about equity in a growth tech company, a value oriented utilities operator, or even a distressed oil company, the answer can be broken down further into two components or sets of assumptions:

1. What are those future cash flows this company will produce for this equity share I'm buying?
2. What discount do I give them to calculate their value today?

# Future Cash Flows:

The first component I imagine everyone is conceptually super familiar with. Everyone see's headlines about revenue growth or earnings growth and some kind of % figure that gets them excited. So when it comes to the value of equity, which do we care about?

The answer here is less commonly thrown around. The cash flows we calculate into for an equity valuation are the **Free Cash Flow to Equity**, or **FCFE.**

In short, **FCFE** is how much cash is available to all shareholders **AFTER** all expenses, reinvestment, and debts have been paid. A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.

So how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.

`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`

Thankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.

So this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our ""Terminal Value"" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:

`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`

Now there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.

Now that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?

# Discount Rates:

This is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.

Let's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).

So how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of ""buying the thing that gives you those cash flows"" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.

So how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:

`FV = PV (1+r)^t`

That is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:

`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`

We already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **""HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?""**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.

What the fuck is ""**cost of equity**"" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as ""costs"" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \[mentor of Fischer Black\], William Sharpe \[known for the Sharpe Ratio\], and Merton Miller \[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's ""cost"" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what ""cost"" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:

`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`

R(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the ""cost"" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.

Rrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.

B is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?

And finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.

Let's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.

`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`

That's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.

This finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.

# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)

I'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.

For a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.

First things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \[insert s word thing that shall not be named\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).

&amp;#x200B;

||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|
|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|

Now we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion

At first glance impressions are easy to be ""holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!"". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our ""What is this worth today?"" question.

So for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.

Continuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:

Rrfr: 1.0%

Beta: 2.0

ERP: 10%

Using these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.

So using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).

&amp;#x200B;

|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|

The sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.

But that's not all.

Now let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.

Our cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|
|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|

With just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.

I'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain. In a nutshell that folks, is the power of compounding and why small shifts in a seemingly benign rate can shift massive changes in values for these growth stocks that are primarily basing their value on cash flows happening 10-15 years from now.",stocks,PSA: Why Treasury Rates matter for your Fundamental Equity Valuations,493.0,0.95

There’s been eviction moratoria in various forms in the US for nearly a year now, and the numbers of people delinquent in either are rising.  Yet the market keeps going up even in retail companies.  We’re seeing a dip right now due to various things like rising bond yields, stimulus package wavering and negotiation, trade wars in semiconductors leading to a knock-on effect of decreased production in automotive, and Asian and European markets having their own issues.  Meme stocks are still flailing about with strange correlations not just to each other, but with the market overall (there’s something here that also concerns me, but that’s for another post).

The jobs report for February was quite positive:  more jobs, decreased unemployment.  [(source)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/february-jobs-report-labor-department-unemployment-pandemic-192526748.html)

Non-farm payrolls: +379,000 vs. +200,000 expected and a revised +166,000 in January
Unemployment rate: 6.2% vs. 6.3% expected and 6.3% in January
Average hourly earnings, month-over-month: 0.2% vs. 0.2% expected and a revised 0.1% in January

Personal disposable income lept in January by 11% compared to the previous month.  [(source)](https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/personal-income-and-outlays-january-2021)

Since a lot of income and spending numbers are relative to GDP, we can see that there was a massive drop Q2 2020, and regained only 34% of that drop in the following quarter.  We haven’t recovered that initial drop yet, not by a long shot.  Q4 didn’t help much. [(source)](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)

US GDP dropped expectedly in 2020 by 2.3%.

&gt; Current-dollar GDP decreased 2.3 percent, or $500.6 billion, in 2020 to a level of $20.93 trillion, compared with an increase of 4.0 percent, or $821.3 billion, in 2019 (tables 1 and 3). 

&gt; Measured from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020, real GDP decreased 2.5 percent during the period (table 6). That compared with an increase of 2.3 percent during 2019.

&gt; More Than 5% of Americans Didn’t Pay Rent, Mortgage in December [(source)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/u-s-household-survey-data-points-to-looming-forbearance-cliff) (February 8, 2021)

These articles and more all have the same theme:  people are behind on home payments, even if only partially.

There’s also a persistent expectation of loss of employment income with [this US Census survey](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?mapPeriodSelector=14&amp;barChartPeriodSelector=14&amp;mapAreaSelector=st&amp;barChartAreaSelector=st) with weekly data for 24 weeks (raw data available for download).  There’s a nice map there that breaks things down by state and by metro area.  A common theme here is large non-farm employment hubs like L.A., Miami, New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, San Diego, and Nevada (where I suspect Las Vegas and Reno are getting hit hard since they’re heavy tourism and service sectors).  These expectation percentages are large in leading metro areas.

There’s [this January 2021 survey](https://www.blackknightinc.com/black-knights-first-look-at-january-2021-mortgage-data/) on mortgage data that appears mixed.  Two bullet points demonstrate this:

&gt; The national mortgage delinquency rate fell to 5.9% in January, dropping below 6% for the first time since March 2020

&gt; At the current rate of improvement, 1.8 million mortgages will still be seriously delinquent at the end of June when foreclosure moratoriums on government-backed loans are currently slated to lift

A large concern is the moratorium extension Biden issued on January 21st.  The extension moves the expiration from March 31st to June 31st.  The reason it’s a concern is because it’s only for mortgages, not also rent.

&gt; The White House said the extended protections are in part aimed at prioritizing communities of color hit hardest by the pandemic. Homeowners of color make up a disproportionate share of the home owners with delinquent loans or on forbearance plans. 

&gt; However, Tuesday's actions did not address the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal moratorium on evictions for not paying rent. That moratorium is also set to expire March 31. About one-third of all Americans, roughly 107 million people, are renters. [(source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/16/mortgage-relief-ban-home-foreclosures-extended-joe-biden/6755036002/)

We keep pushing these quarterly moratoria out by one quarter, and I’m not sure what politicians are expecting to happen inside three months that will address this situation to a sufficient degree.  Debt is debt, and people getting their jobs back doesn’t mean that debt goes away instantly.  

The service sector is the largest non-farm sector in the US economy by employment [(source)](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm).  That sector has also gotten kicked square in the balls by the pandemic.  The fact that the service sector pays crap to most of its employees means that they have a really hard time building up emergency funds and are therefore likely to be small.  With an extended period of reduced wages or just plain unemployment means that most of those emergency funds will have likely been drained by now.

That’s a long way of saying there are lots of low-income folks on the edge of eviction with no help whatsoever in sight.  From the Bloomberg article above on February 8, 20201: 

&gt; Some 9.3 million jobs were lost last year and the U.S. suffered the sharpest rise in the poverty rate since the 1960s.

Bash a bear all you want, I don’t see any other interpretation of this data other than politicians refusing to defuse a massive economic time bomb.

That does not mean that there won’t be growth in sectors.  I just don’t like the fact that I just now seriously considered for a few minutes getting into a payday loan ETF (they’ve somewhat flatlined, which I’m actually thankful for, maybe due to various state-level legislation in recent years limiting their collective growth potential).

If [current monetary policy](https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0Ex6kAKAoFRsFh6M/200.gif) was to avoid a crash in March 2020, they succeeded.  I’m no economist, so I can’t critique one way or the other if it was the smart thing to do, but we can’t deny the effects that it’s going to have:  increased inflation.  It’s possible that the intent was to turn a crash into inflation which the Fed can manage better, but it’s not clear if really they just dumped money into the economy only to save the stock market with near complete disregard for the long-term effects.  We’ve heard JPow say their policy has been adjusted inflation targets to *average* 2% per year, but naturally that implies at least one year of &gt; 2% inflation, likely more.  If an economist or two can lend some insight here as to their intent and potential mitigation strategies, it would be extremely helpful.  I worry that the party will be over when they transition to finite QE.

The picture is far more complex than these statistics.  As far as calling this DD, it’s incomplete, but I’m posting it here to get a more in-depth conversation started.  There are gaps to fill, statistics to clarify, and simply just more research that needs to be done to get a better picture.

Personally, I’m not doing this to profit on what could be a gut punch followed by a long, slow bleed.  I want to have hard data to present to my representatives and tell them what areas need fixing.

511,onestockperson,0.0,9.0,"I see lots of posts and comments about Corsair ($CRSR). Many reminds potential investors about the lockup period ending 22nd March. This won’t be a problem. Why? Probably because those people doesn’t know CRSR history. 

First of all, Corsair has 91.85 million shares outstanding. Corsair is also (basically) owned by a hedge fund called EagleTree. They *used* to own 76% percent of the shares. In January 2021, they sold 7 million of those shares to Goldman Sachs among others for $35 a share. We are below $32 today. EagleTree now owns 68.55%. 

This means that the majority holder of CRSR already sold a chunk to secure profits. They sold a minimal of their shares two months ago - which means they didn’t wait till the lockup period to sell. Therefore it doesn’t make sense to anticipate a big selloff, when the biggest shareholder can sell at any time. Also, selling below $35 is unlikely. Moreover, I don’t see them giving up the majority of shares anytime soon. 

Here you can find the rough ownerships:

68.55% of shares owned by EagleTree
28.56% of shares are in float
Rest is owned by insiders. With 3.4M shares traded daily, this should not worry anyone. 

Source: page 175: https://ir.corsair.com/node/7201/html

TLDR: Don’t worry about insiders selling when lockup expires. They already secured profits at $35 a share. We are at $32 right now. Also, they don’t have thousands of employees owning millions of shares, only the management - whom own less than 5 million shares (remember we average 3.4 million shares traded on daily average). Unless the hedge fund owning Corsair dumps their whole position (which I find unlikely due to their history of offering to other hedge funds, and the need for control of Corsair), then you have nothing to worry about.",stocks,Why there won’t be a selloff when $CRSR lockup ends.,9.0,0.77

514,ilikeorangecats,0.0,4.0,"Hi. Over the past few weeks, I've seen a lot of comments and posts that assert a multi-trillion dollar stimulus bill will lead to positive, upward trends in the stock market. I hope these theories are correct, but I don't understand the connection between economic stimulus spending and the stock market well enough to know if these are valid assumptions. I keep thinking of reasons why the stimulus potentially *wouldn't* help or impact the market, but I'd like to hear from other people.

First, I think there’s a misconception that the economy and stock market always move in tandem. Often they do, but sometimes they don't. For instance, if you look at last March, the market corrected  as initial COVID shut-downs and restrictions were enacted, then it quickly reversed, while COVID cases and economic conditions worsened. Despite a few minor corrections along the way, the market reached its pre-March peak by November, then it went on to reach all-time highs over the next few months. During this time, the economy struggled, and didn't really start to show signs of life again until late 2020/early 2021, as vaccine roll-outs were underway; with each month that passed following the March shut-downs and restrictions, unemployment rates increased, COVID cases skyrocketed, small businesses shuttered, and industrial giants in travel, hospitality, etc. struggled and realized significant financial loss. So, if the market performed well while the economy didn't, could we assume that the market could still enter a downward trend while the economy recovers during the next several months?

Second, I suspect there are potential implications of injecting trillion dollars into the economy, but I don't know what they are exactly or how they'd impact the market (or not). This may sound dumb/naive, but where does the government get this money from, and would they owe money over time to use this money now? Would they keep running the money printer, and then, wouldn’t inflation be a potential risk? Or (either/or/and??) would it be borrowed and paid back over time with increased interest? What I’m trying to understand here is the potential of interest and/or inflation, which chances are, could negatively impact the stock market, overriding the potential for the stimulus money to positively affect the market.

Perhaps someone more knowledgeable could identify what I'm missing or where I'm wrong, and make a case for why the stimulus bill could help the market?

515,psychotrader00,0.0,55.0,"After falling steeply in the morning, the major indices reversed to finish firmly in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department February Unemployment report, rising Treasury yields, and developments surrounding stimulus. 

The US added back the most jobs in four months in February, as falling coronavirus cases, an increase in the pace of vaccinations, and easing social distancing guidelines are allowing many businesses to reopen. Non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 in February, or well above the 200,000 expected. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2%, unexpectedly improving compared to January's 6.3%. The February jobs report also included a notable upward revision to payroll. January’s payroll gain was revised up to 166,000 from the tepid 49,000 previously reported.

In response to the positive jobs reports, Treasury yields rose once again to hover near its one-year high. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 1.6% today before dipping to 1.557% at the time of writing. As a reminder, high expectations of economic growth causes Treasury yields to rise as the demand for bonds drops in order to make them more attractive. 

Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

Texas said Tuesday that it was lifting its mask requirement and would allow businesses to fully reopen, the most expansive step by any state to remove coronavirus restrictions as Americans across the country are eager to emerge after a year of isolation in the pandemic. 

Senate Democrats struck a last-minute agreement Friday to set federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week, down from the $400 passed by the House, but extend their duration by more than a month as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a Democratic aide. Democrats hope to pass the bill before the mid-March cliff where enhanced federal unemployment benefits from the previous relief package expire.

People are mentioning inflation or the rising 10yr bond yield, but I personally don’t know how much I buy that as a good reason because Jerome Powell has been doing everything he can to soothe all the worrying about inflation, plus inflation is relatively not even that high, historically speaking. Neither is the bond yield, which was over double what it currently is within the last few years.

The only thing I can really come up with as to why this is all happening is just that investors know that valuations are high right now and are expecting something to happen so they’re on high alert and are jumpy right now. When anything happens or nothing happens, everyone is ready to sell because the logical expectations that this growth is unsustainable and it’s gotta come to an end eventually, even though technically there’s nothing going on right now to indicate that it should be ending soon. People are just scared because they’re uncertain and therefore overreacting.

I could be wrong, I’m no expert here.

Anyways, on to my question. After a week of sell offs and freak outs, could the coming weekend be a nice little break from the harsh stress of the stock market? Is this a phenomenon that exists? Like maybe Wall Street has a terrible week such as the one we just had, and then everyone gets two days off of trading or following ticker symbols and this allows them to take a step back and realize that actually, things may not be as dire as we thought during the week (again, I personally can’t understand what the root cause of these major sell offs really is). 

My hope is that come Monday, investors are more well rested and rationally thinking and we see some green on Monday as cooler heads prevail.

Many investors on the Internet said it was a good buy so I decided to look into the company a bit. I was pleased to see that Facebook had very solid fundamentals from a quantitative standpoint. Very good revenue, earnings, ROIC and cash flow with a monster balance sheet. On top of all this, it was trading at a lower PE ratio than the other FAANG stocks. The stock was also trading below its intrinsic value using a DCF model. Facebook appeared to be a perfect buy. 

Here's the thing, as I've dug a little deeper, I saw that Facebook was sitting on a mountain of cash that keeps growing over the years, yet the capital expenditure remained more or less the same over the years, which means Facebook certainly isn't reinvesting its extra cash. So what are they doing with all this money? Facebook isn't giving out a dividend to the shareholders so I assumed they would at least buy back their own shares while it's cheap, but not only are they not buying back their shares, Mark Zuckerberg has been aggressively selling his own shares in the past months.

Hasbro just announced that they are putting a divisions for consumer toys / products; Entertainment for licensing in films / content; and Wizards &amp; Digital Content. 

With the expansion of D&amp;D online, Asmodee games acquiring Board Game Arena and expanding its online board game presence, Hasbro is a multi billion dollar company that must have some sort of digital subscription platform in the works.

One suggestion I offer to everyone, and it is something I do myself: I keep about 15% of my portfolio in BRKB at all times. I added tremendously in last year’s ~175 range, and have dealt with questioning and at times outright ridicule as to why I would sideline a significant portion of my portfolio when it has under performed the s&amp;p500 for the last 15 years.

I also keep 10-20% in VOO. Another 40% is spread out among ETFs, and the remainder home run swings. But I want to focus on precisely why Berkshire Hathaway is such a valuable investment vehicle so that many of you can consider it in the future.

Now is not the time to buy. Once all of this blows over and people are back to fetishizing growth, there may be some great entry opportunities. But it should not be looked at as purchasing an individual stock—instead you are buying a mindset toward diversifying amongst value assets. It’s insurance giant that diversifies on a time-tested philosophy and acts as insurance for your portfolio. Since I added back last year it’s up 40%+ and is carrying my portfolio through the turmoil. You don’t even have to own a lot to make it a winner. But when the market acts like this it really makes things easier psychologically.

There are concerns, of course. Warren isn’t going to live forever, and the company has been hesitant to capitalize on some major opportunities. But I imagine they may make some moves here that we will hear about later on if value presents itself. And the succession plan has been meticulously considered, just as Buffett’s investments are.

But anyway—plug for a company that is boring and overlooked, but run by guys who get this stuff better than all of us combined.

538,moneytobemade8,0.0,3.0,"One of the best ways to reduce your risk is by diversification. This can usually be done by holding many stocks in different industries or more simply holding an index. Let me explain why.

There are two kinds of risks. One is systematic risk and the other is non-systematic risk. We can eliminate non-systematic risk through diversification, but not systematic risk. Systematic risk is also called market risk which means it impacts the whole market. For example, this could be due to a hike in interest rates, Treasury Yields rising and etc. This impacts the whole market and cannot be diversified.

However, there is also called non-systematic risk. This is a firm-specific or industry-specific risk. For example, if a company has a product recall, the risk is only for that specific company and not other companies. An industry-specific risk is if the whole industry is shaken by something only impacting that industry. For example, we saw this with oil prices a year ago. Oil companies went down, but other companies weren't specifically down.

Why does this matter and how does it relate to risk. Well, we can eliminate all non-systematic risk by holding a diversified portfolio. The reason for this is because many stocks won't be as correlated with one another, which means that any really bad gains can be offset by any really good gains and vice versa. Theoretically, You won't be exposed to non-systematic risk since you are eliminating it by holding a diversified portfolio. The only risk you have is systematic risk (market risk). Theoretically, we are not compensated by non-systematic risk since it is a risk we can diversify.

Just keep in mind that when you buy industry-specific ETF's or if your portfolio is concentrated in one sector, you are exposing yourself to more risk than necessary.",stocks,Reducing Your Risk By Diversification,3.0,0.8

And no one wants to hear about other investors getting wrecked, however vindicated perma-bears may feel when we get into market correction territory. There are a lot of new investors who recently got into investors because they saw the upside potential, and which weren’t expecting to see (relatively) big losses. This post is for them.

While I have my “safe” index funds as half my portfolio, together with “satellite” more industry-focused ETFs (genomics, and a more prospective small gap and global markets), I’m in fairly deep to tech and the NASDAQ. Like a lot of you, the last few weeks have put me safely in the red.

It’s worth considering what you’re investing FOR at this point. If, like me, you’re relatively young and looking to grow wealth - it’s why tech is appealing. It’s why potential future growth in smaller and riskier tech stocks is a large part of the portfolio. Ultimately, that upside can be very worth it - you can make exponential gains on relatively small amounts. But with greater upside comes greater risk. The downside. Which we’re now starting to experience in potential tech market correction territory.

See this as the necessary pain, and the opportunity to get into positions at a discount, and average down on those long term investments you believe in. Continue to consider your investment thesis and DD. If you believe in the stocks long term, these red days don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. Don’t panic sell just because it isn’t green.

That said, also use this as a learning opportunity. Make sure you’re *actually* doing DD. That means quantitative, as well as qualitative. As much as posters discussing P/S and P/E ratios have been dismissed as “boomers”, market fundamentals remain important, however divorced prices seem to become from them. It’s hard to price exponential growth and the chance to dominate industries that barely exist now, but understanding and applying the fundamentals will help you decide which companies to get into in different industry sectors, and a good price to do so at. This will help your confidence in holding, and setting targets on when to enter new positions.

Also, don’t make the classic gambler’s mistake of betting what you can’t afford to lose on “a sure thing”. There’s no such thing in the market.

Ultimately, there may have been a renewable energy / EV bubble that may now have burst. There will likely be bag holders. All these stocks could continue to bleed. But, you’ve missed the window to get out with relatively small losses. Rather than panic selling, continue to take a rational view on what the companies you’re in are fundamentally worth - and therefore whether you’re happy to baghold for an amount of time to see profits on them, or if cutting your losses makes sense.

It’s also worth dispelling the idea that “tech” exists as some homogenous thing, or that these companies are all like the dot com bubble - essentially worthless, with no business models, just trying to capitalise on the internet’s future potential. Plenty of these companies may be overvalued and significantly oversold, but they aren’t worthless. “Tech” sits across so many industry verticals it becomes slightly meaningless as a term. Cloud computing, semiconductors, social media, future technologies such as indoor farming / genomics / space transportation, eCommerce, consumer hardware, data analytics etc may all be “tech”, but you can hopefully see they aren’t all one and the same.

The time to *really* worry about prospective growth small / med cap stocks carrying a lot of debt as they build towards businesses that may be profitable in future is when debt becomes more expensive. While the markets are never rational, there hasn’t been a fundamental change meaning cheap debt is no longer a thing. Fear and panic creates more fear and panic. Keep hold of your head. Take time away from your portfolio. Don’t speculate with what you can’t afford to lose. Have confidence you’ll weather this, make sound investments and see future gains when consistent green days are back on the menu.

TL;DR - high growth potential tech is risky, because of the potential massive upside. With that comes downside. You won’t get such a wild ride with “safe” NYSE type stocks for the most part, but you’re also unlikely to get such high returns. Consider what’s important to you. Do proper DD, so you’re clear on why you’re investing and the value (not price) of a stock.

I have just gotten into the stock market. I usually use E-Trade. My verification was taking abnormally long and had errors, keeping me from finding my account. So to deal with that, I purchased $GME through Cashapp. Now, I am unsure about whether or not I should keep the stock in my Cashapp account or move it to my E-Trade account. 

So far, the process of moving it over has been confusing because Cashapp doesn't show up automatically amongst the brokers list in E-Trade. I'm only trying to transfer it because I'm scared that if this Gamestop squeeze actually works, Cashapp isn't going to pay out in full or let me sell my stock.

People are talking a lot about the 10yr yields (which I think is mostly just a catalyst), but to help understand the bigger picture of what's happening I think it's helpful to look at price charts going back 5 years. If you pull up NIO, AAPL or even VTI back to 2016, you can see just how relatively huge the run-up in price has been the past year compared to history. When people talk about taking gains and a bubble, they're people who invested at least mid-last year (probably earlier), saw an astronomical rise, and are now adjusting as the price inches back to pre-pandemic levels.

It seems like a bloodbath because we bought in at the top. But from their perspective, this is a correction after a massive run up. A crash, for them, would be returning to or going lower than pre-pandemic levels (which we're still aways off from).

Wholesale lending to consumers through a network of independent mortgage brokers is UWMC and FIM entire business and makes up about 25% of RKT's.

UWMC said that they had heard from about 580 mortgage brokers by last evening and that 550 had signed the addendum (there are an estimated 40,000 brokers in the US according to the Association of Independent Mortgage Experts)

This will be a disaster for someone. If UWMC can successfully prevent brokers from working with anyone but them, it will destroy FIM and put a big hole in RKT's income statement.

I used to check my stock app every minute and sold because I got nervous and uncomfortable. I would see gains that have made insane money disappear and sell off trying to hopefully get back at a lower price. From personal experience, I would encourage many of you to take one hard look at your stock portfolio right now and ask yourself if this is a company you see being able to exist in the long-term future. If the answer is no, you should cut some of your position or get rid of it. If the answer is yes, sit back, maybe liquidate a few shares, but don't get uneasy about it. It's the stock market - you win some, you lose some. If the company you own isn't going through a fundamental change such as a huge decrease in revenue or an SEC investigation, stop being upset.

If I never sold a single share of any company from the day I started investing, I would likely be a millionaire right now with an initial investment of $30,000. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy companies you trust and can reasonably see being a sustainable business and just ride it. More often than not, you're going to end up green.

567,belowlight,0.0,4.0,"I’ve sometimes been recommended to disregard my opinion of a company and judge a stock purely on a single question instead: Is this stock currently undervalued, or does it fairly represent the value of the company?

However I think if you’re looking to invest for the long term and you aren’t expecting to turn a quick profit then stocks that you understand or that operate in an industry you have some expertise in can surely offer an opportunity to judge future performance or even the potential of a company much more accurately because you simply have more information available with which to make a decision.

Am I deluding myself? Should I stay clear of companies i subjectively like and try to find a more objective measure?

Or is subjective opinion just part of assessing value anyway?

I read in a book an account of someone investing a lot of money in Ford stocks after attending one of their motor shows or something. Saying “Ford sure know how to build a car”. But that doesn’t mean their stock performance will be any good of course.

That example is pretty obvious but it’s harder to judge at a more granular level. For example picking a tech stock based on my interaction with a company and their products, plus some research showing they appear to be on a trend toward growth over coming years. Sounds fine until you realise a competitor is set to release an industry changing product and suddenly the question is how fast the first guys can adapt.

This is a post of very basic guidelines when it comes to trading and investing, and I think it's important info regardless of the current state of the market. Note - I am not a financial advisor, but these are general rules I think everyone should think about before they buy in.


* **Can I afford to invest this money?** - This is by far one of the most important things to ask yourself. If you have an extra $1000 laying around that you are 100% certain you will be okay living without, then proceed on to the next step. If you have any second thoughts or hesitations, the answer is no. Be honest with yourself here. Do you have bills and rent to pay? Are you expecting a big expense in the next few weeks or months? Do you have an emergency fund in place? Remember, once your money is invested, what happens to it is out of your hands. Whatever you decide to invest in may turn out well, or it may totally blow up in your face. Think carefully here.

* **How soon am I expecting a return?** - Are you investing for retirement in 40 years? Or are you expecting to mess around and turn a nice profit in a month? There are no right answers, only what you are hoping to achieve. Depending on your answer, there are different instruments and securities that can help you realize your timeline. However, in general, the sooner you are expecting a profit, the more risk there may be. Which moves me to my next point.

* **How much risk am I willing to tolerate?** - Saving for retirement in 40 years, and are not much of a risk taker? Great! The stock market works well for people in this category since, overall, the stock market grows positively over the course of decades (with some negative dips due to things like recessions, crashes, etc). Looking to turn a profit ASAP and consider yourself a risk-taker? Great! The stock market has something for that, too. Want a profit ASAP but not willing to take a risk? The stock market may not be for you. Consider a loan. 

* **What investments will help me reach my goal?** - So you've decided on your investment amount, your timeline, and your risk. Now the question is what the heck do you invest in? In general, those with longer timelines and lower risk can benefit from things like index funds or ETFs. Without getting too detailed, these are basically the average performance of a group of top companies within a sector. The S&amp;P 500 is an index fund of the top 500 companies in the US and is generally a safe index. ETFs are similar in that they track the average performance of multiple companies, however, they can narrow down to be sector specific. You can invest in an ETF of almost any sector, from electric vehicles to air travel to even marijuana businesses. Since they all track the average performance of multiple companies, there's less risk since one company performing negatively in that fund may be countered by positive performances of many others. If you feel strongly enough about any one single company, and want to invest in that company by itself, there's nothing wrong with doing so. But remember, this carries a bit of risk as you won't get the benefit of having losses offset by way of an index/ETF. For those of with shorter timelines and higher risk profiles, you can look to invest in more volatile stocks (meme stocks and the like) and make trades based on their day to day/week to week performance. There's definitely big returns to be made with the right play, but again, the risk is higher and you need to be prepared for that. Options are also another popular (and riskier) investment vehicle, which is essentially a bet on a stock's movement in the future. I won't go into details about that here, but you should check out r/options to learn more.

**Conclusion** - Decide what you're willing to invest (and possibly lose), what your timeline is,  how much risk you're willing to accept, and then find the right investment vehicle to achieve it. Thanks for reading, and best of luck!",stocks,Basics for new investors,72.0,0.9

From all the ""buying the dip"" memes and ""preplanned dip"" conspiracy theories, it's scary to think that people actually take advice from crazy conversations like that.

Investing into a specific sector or even a specific single stock is a high risk / reward play and not a magical money press. A broadly diversified investment which actually represents the global economy like a [Vanguard FTSE All-World ETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B3RBWM25#chart) is down 1% over last month and that is nothing unusual and happens from time to time.

TSLA and some of the other tech stocks are down majorly because it just makes sense. TSLA was a very clear bubble in a lot of people's mind and other tech stocks have grown too fast in too little time and now people are taking their profits off of those. These bubbles are clearly visible and yet some people here just blindly invested into them, either directly or via sector ETFs (or ARK's ETFs). And don't bet on the fact that TSLA will go back up. The fact that it's going down will actually mean that a lot of passive investment products (such as index ETFs) will start selling TSLA shares which will further drop its value. **If you are ""buying the dip"" on stocks like that, you are gambling.**

If you don't know what you are doing and don't understand ""why the markets are down"", it's best you probably reconsider your options and just switch to something much more diversified that you can actually just buy and ignore for 20 years. And if that's not what you wanted: You are gambling and people lose when they gamble.

I started investing in October 2019 with a very small amount of money. I had about $2,000 in the market when COVID hit and my account (which was then at $3,100) dropped to around $1,650. Now I'm normally a pretty risky person so this drop didn't scare me off from investing and I knew technically I had only lost $350 of MY money, so all this did was make me want to invest more. I kept adding and adding funds as the economy recovered and I even got lucky on a couple picks. I say lucky because that's what it was, dumb luck. I picked companies because I believed in their industry moving forward, never looking at financial reports or anything along those lines. The most I ever did was look at analyst recommendations and estimated end of year SP. I know what you're thinking right now, this guy deserves everything that came to him, and youre probably right.

As the year went on I got up to around $12,000 deposited and in mid-February my account was at $37,000 (again because I hit a very lucky stock pick that catapulted that total). I currently sit at about $24,000. These past 2 weeks have wiped out almost half of my overall account and im losing my mind. I know normal traders rarely ever beat the market and I definitely fell for the belief that I was someone who could and I was dumb enough to think I could do that without even researching or learning from the beginning before risking my money. Regardless, now I'm here. I still have gains but I'm emotionally a wreck. $13,000 is a lot of money for me and I was looking at buying my own place soon but now that dream seems years in the future.

Always having two positions open with equal size - a low BUY and a high SELL with a distance of let's say minimum 5%.

I plan to gradually extend the distance between those positions so the gains increase and the possibility that the price lands in the ""green zone"" is also increased.

Ofc fees would apply to the SELL position but if I trade smart on extending the green zone I could make small profits and cover the fees with that.

**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: Vuzix Corp ($VUZI)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: +46.3%

Month on Month increase in mentions: +1029% 

Average sentiment across mentions: **+34.97%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

Vuzix is an American technology firm that mainly focuses on wearable display technology, virtual and augmented reality. One of the major differences between Vuzix and its competitors is that Vuzix focuses on specific niche sectors like healthcare, logistics, service training, etc. and their products are currently being used in the market today. Vuzix is considered a pioneer in wearable computing and augmented reality and has been working in this field since 1997. 

The advancements made in mobile technology and 5G networks have now reached a stage where it enables wearable technology that is not clunky or too intrusive like the Google glasses. Currently, they have 3 products (M400, M4000, and Blade), all of which are targeted towards industrial customers and are currently deployed in the field. 

**Financials**

Vuzix is not a profitable company and expects to report an operating loss of around $4.4MM for Q4 2020. Their revenue experienced almost a 100% spike from $2MM in Q4’19 to 4MM in Q4’20. Even though the company is not profitable yet, they maintain a great balance sheet. 

Debt to Equity ratio is only 0.09 and they have a strong cash position of $52MM (inclusive of converted warrants) which implies they have a long runway to scale and make the unit economics work. They are also currently foraying into a total solutions package that is part hardware and part SaaS to create a recurring revenue model.

One additional thing to consider here is that there has been consistent insider buying of shares and no selling which indirectly showcases the management’s confidence in the company’s future prospects.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

The buzz is generated primarily due to the following reasons 

Cathie Wood’s ARK bought more than 1MM shares of Vuzix in their Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF(ARKQ). According to ARK’s forecast, AR market would grow from $1B today to $130B by 2030 and Vuzix is the leading contender with its long experience and wide IP rights (Vuzix currently has 184 Patents in the AR/VR field). 

One of the other factors which is driving up the demand is pandemic-driven adoption trends. There are strong demands from the field of virtual healthcare and remote training and service calls. Most of their products are back-ordered/out of stock due to the extreme demand.

They have also fared well at CES 2021 winning 3 awards for their Next Generation Smart Glasses (A smart glass that looks exactly like normal specs). This news should definitely be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism as CES is liberal in giving out awards and Vuzix hasn’t given out their glasses for testing to any reliable tech reviewers.

**Risk and Competition** 

There is definitely significant risk associated with investing in small-cap stocks. The main risk factors for Vuzix that I could see are 

a. Competition from Big-Tech firms: Almost all the major tech players (Apple, Google, Qualcomm) are in the field/planning to enter the field of AR glasses. While Vuzix owns a considerable number of patents, the best-case scenario for them would be to get acquired by a big tech company as they don’t have the financial backing or supply chain capabilities to take on established companies and successfully deliver on a consumer product.

   b. Unit economics: Vuzix cannot be classified as a startup (they have been around for 23 years) and is still cash flow negative. The company needs to improve its scalability so to generate profits. The current rise in demand due to pandemic might be just the ideal situation for them to scale. 

c.  Intel ownership change: 30% of the company was owned by Intel in 2015. As of Mar’21, Intel does not have any ownership in the company. I am not able to find any reliable source of information on why Intel sold their stake in the company. But, on the other hand, there are established funds like BlackRock and ARK buying into the company. 

**Conclusion** 

Augmented Reality is being touted as one of the megatrends of the next decade. Even though there are significant risks in-terms of widespread acceptance of AR among consumers, established and well-funded competitors, Vuzix with its wide portfolio of products, proven market use case in niche sectors and extensive IP rights puts it in a very strong position for the future.

597,0toHeroInvesting,0.0,21.0,"**Do you like to invest in growth stocks? Are you also interested in subscription-based companies? Then today we are going to talk about one of 2020’s investor favorite, Peloton!**

**\~Very Long Post - Don't Read If You Hate Long DDs\~**

We are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF while we will also do a little technical analysis and get some price targets for the workout at home favorite for this year and for 2025 as I will give my opinion if Peloton still has room to grow or if this is was a one-year unicorn!

**\[Full Disclosure - I have no positions in Peloton, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next days\]**

So, what is Peloton and what do they do? They are a [company](https://imgur.com/5X1tZbO) that offers hardware fitness products like their Bike or Tread, but compared to your other traditional companies, they also offer subscriptions which allow you to watch live streams or on-demand classes that will help you with your home workouts.

You can also get these streaming products through their own Peloton app, which costs $13/month without any of their hardware devices, as Peloton mostly offers premium products that are targeting high end consumers, with their Tread starting from $2500 and up to $4300, while their Bikes are priced in the $1900 to $2500 price range.

They became a very popular stock in the past year as they saw a huge boost in their revenues &amp; earnings in 2020, as more &amp; more people switched to home workouts, though it will be very interesting to see if this trend can continue after things start going back to normal.

**So, guys, let’s go through the 2th quarter results for Peloton, as they use a different financial year, starting in the middle of the year!**

Peloton released the latest earnings [report](https://imgur.com/e2XJgEf) at the start of February in which they beat both the top line by $30M and the bottom line, as the company posted an $0.18/share profit

The revenue generated in the last quarter and the number of connected subscriptions [grew](https://imgur.com/rvUjDdj) by over 120% year/year, which was hugely boosted by the events we saw in 2020.

Peloton has 2 main streams of revenues, the connected fitness products and the subscriptions revenues.

You can see [here](https://imgur.com/PEzBMmW) the company made just over $1B in total revenues in the last quarter, which was an increase of 29% over the last quarter, continuing the uptrend started in 2020.

Peloton saw an increase of 45% in revenues from connected fitness products, even though they are still facing big delays in delivering their products to customers, with both bikes and treads seeing delivery time of over 6 weeks even now.

I believe this revenue stream growth will likely peak this year, which I expect to be the last one where workouts at home are the nr.1 way to stay in shape.

Meanwhile, their other revenue stream, the subscriptions revenue, has increased over 240% over the same period in 2019, and has increased 23% over the previous quarter.

On the other hand, their cost of sales for both the hardware products as well as the subscription services has pretty much stayed the same, hovering over 60% for the [hardware](https://imgur.com/WklsExN) equipment and around 40% for the [subscription](https://imgur.com/yAcVAoU) services.

I don’t see how they will drastically improve this, so I will just slightly increase their margins by 1%/year for both revenue streams.

The other operating expenses are also pretty significant for the company, as they use [over](https://imgur.com/zi7scZV) 13% of their revenues for General &amp; Administrative purposes.

Peloton also [invests](https://imgur.com/65pEtEh) 4.5% of their revenues back into R&amp;D to continue to stay ahead of the competition, while the biggest chunk of the [OpEx](https://imgur.com/mwu5emz) goes to sales &amp; marketing which accounts for over 16% of their total revenues.

The company does have decent [financials](https://imgur.com/jVHpMgw) with over $2B cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities which can easily pay off the current and long-term liabilities of the company which stand at just under $2B.

Peloton has increased their capital [expenditures](https://imgur.com/ouNgPm2) in the past year, spending $120M in the last 6 months of 2020 compared to under $50M for the same period in 2019, and this will continue to increase, as they have a pending transaction to acquire [Precor](https://imgur.com/8ayKVp7) for over $400M in cash.

The company has continued to [increase](https://imgur.com/givDlZe) the depreciation &amp; amortization expenses, which will have a positive impact on their EBITDA, while on the other hand, they have pretty insignificant other incomes &amp; expenses on their bottom line, with just $1.8M [added](https://imgur.com/z4o8zeS) to the bottom line in the last quarter of 2020.

Not all companies do, but Peloton gives pretty detailed data which allows us to easily calculate the net working capital of the company for the DCF numbers, though you should always dig deep through the financials as Pelton has once major problem, which is the share dilution of the company.

We can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/r0nBAZf) , the company has almost 300M shares outstanding, but the bigger problem is that they have massively increased the number of shares available, up from 160M in 2019 and are planning to continue to dilute their stock as they are giving out a big number of stock options for their employees, with over 50M [shares](https://imgur.com/B4k2PEg) just in the last 3 months of 2020

This stock compensation plan is [based](https://imgur.com/qyknNRm) on their 2019 equity incentive plan, which continued after their 2015 plan. In this plan the company allows up to 5% of the total outstanding shares to be granted until 2029, which will continue to add pressure to the price of the stock

The other risk factors that the company [mentioned](https://imgur.com/rAEGr22) are the increasingly competitive market they operate in, a possible decline in their Bike &amp; Tread sales and of course the supply chain issues, which have affected the company for the past year.

The company itself points out the fact that they just become profitable in the past 2 quarters after losing money in each year since their inception, but [provided](https://imgur.com/xn34i2P) an upbeat guidance for Q3, as they expect to continue to add additional sales regions for their products in 2021, while also closing the deal with Precor, which will help them in their manufacturing process

So, folks, taking into account the financials of the company, their outlook and my own projections for the growth of company I made some predictions, but please remember, this is not investment advice &amp; do your own Due Diligence before investing!

**Let’s start with the discounted free cash flow projections to see what the current valuation of the company is.**

I [started](https://imgur.com/TxLlTmH) from their current earnings before interest &amp; tax which stand at 7% of their revenues currently. I implied a 2% annual growth for this, as the company will become more profitable as they scale up their business.

The company has a very short history for their effective tax rate, which was way below the 21% US tax rate, but given that most tech companies manage to get substantially better effective tax rates, I think a 15% for Peloton is realistic.

I also added back their D&amp;A for which I implied the same growth rate as the one for their revenues, but we will discuss the revenue growth in a couple of minutes.

Peloton will need to continue to invest in Capex to be able to scale up their business, while their net working capital is expected to decline as they will slowly start to build up inventories after the huge supply crisis that they faced starting in 2020.

So, folks, for an 9.5% discount rate, which is what I will use for the moment, we get just over $3.6B in discounted free cash flows by 2026. This rate is a combination of the average sp500 return and the current yield of the 10year Treasury bill which stands around 1.5%.

As always, there are 2 methods of doing the valuation from here, the EBITDA multiple valuation, for which we get a $152.5 price target and the Perpetuity Approach for which we get a $100 price target.

You might be wondering why I used a 19x EBITDA approach for Peloton, well I chose an average between the 25x multiple for Technology and 14x multiple for the fitness industry.

Folks, I wouldn’t pick one or the other valuation, so I like to use an average approach, which would result in a PRICE target of $126.58 or a 17% upside for the stock in the next 12 months

**Given all of this, I think now is the time to move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Peloton.**

I believe we can [continue](https://imgur.com/UOVmn6U) to see a significant growth for their sales of fitness products in the next years, but this growth will slow down in the future, as we slowly get over this stay-at-home environment, even if we never fully go back to the way things were.

I believe the bigger growth stream will come from their subscription service, as they continue to improve the products they offer, including their Peloton App which doesn’t even require you to own their hardware.

For the cost of sales, as I said previously, I only implied a 1% annual improvement of their margins on both revenue streams as I also maintained their average from the previous 2 years regarding the other operating expenses like SG&amp;A and R&amp;D.

Given these numbers &amp; projections, we get a gross profit for Peloton of just over $2B by 2025. But there are many other things that we have to take into [account](https://imgur.com/nYJMaS3) like the Capex spending, which I believe will continue to see an increase of at least 5%/year and the interest &amp; other income &amp; expenses, which for Peloton are pretty insignificant.

So, the bottom line I think we will see for Peloton in 2025, including an estimated 15% effective tax rate is just under $1.7B.

The last important thing to take into account when doing long-term valuations is how the number of outstanding shares will continue to evolve, and in this case, I believe we will continue to see at least a 5% dilution for Peloton stock in the next years, which would mean by 2025 we would see almost 356M shares.

**So, after all these estimates what are my price targets for the company in the long-run?**

I always like to value companies on future P/E multiples, so, with a $4.69 EPS and depending on what P/E multiple you chose between 25 and 40, we can see the stock can trade in a [range](https://imgur.com/Yd3vi0V) between $117 and $187.

We should also always take a look at what other analysts estimate for the stock, and we can see, there is not much coverage on the stock, but the other analyst predicted an even [lower](https://imgur.com/Ve9kxA1) EPS by 2025.

Folks, my final price targets for Peloton by 2025 range between $129 for the Bear case, $152 for the base case and almost $176 for the bull case, implying gains between 19% and up to 63% on the stock, which I believe are not that interesting, as you can usually get similar returns by just investing in index funds, ETFs ore other stocks with much lower risk factors.

So yeah guys, these are my [OVERALL](https://imgur.com/qSjBldl) price targets for the next 12 months and for 2025

**But now, you are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Peloton?**

Let’s start by looking at this [CHART](https://imgur.com/8aPs73V). We can see Peloton was trading on huge volumes towards the end of last year with 30-40M shares/day on multiple occasions, which we saw again once the Precor news popped up.

Since that moment, the stock seems to have fallen out of favor, as the volume has consistently stayed below 10M shares/day. The stock is pretty oversold right now after the recent sell-off caused by the spike in treasury yields, but has a decent support line near the $108 levels, though I believe it will face major resistance to break $138 again given the fact that no major catalysts are expected soon, as most of the earnings and revenue growth is already priced in the stock price.

Folks, I always check what other wall street [analysts](https://imgur.com/oDfBRNB) think of the stock, and it seems in this case they are massively overvaluing the company in my opinion with 23 bullish ratings and just 2 bearish views, with an average price target of $165.

**So, are you asking yourself, what would I do?**

Well, I would mostly stay away from this stock, as I believe there are far better opportunities out there in the stock market, but if you like you can nibble a little and buy some Peloton after this big sell-off, as the stock is down a lot from its all-time highs.

Yeah guys, [these](https://imgur.com/ROoZH4p) are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Peloton will struggle to enter households with more than 1 of their products, as you can [see](https://imgur.com/OaXePee), only 3% of their customers use both a bike and a tread, which given the huge price tags of their products is understandable.

I also believe the big % of people that are paying month to month their Peloton subscriptions is another reason for concern, as people are much more likely to ditch those once normal gyms become more attractive once again, and as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/OANrA3R), the trend was not working that much in their favor before 2020, with modest increases in fitness subscriptions &amp; quarterly workouts, while their total revenue and average monthly workouts were even going the wrong way.

And finally, after comparing my projections to Peloton’s own [guidance](https://imgur.com/8vy0xjj), which is way lower than my predictions, it’s obvious the company itself doesn’t expect this insane growth to continue, and even if they do continue to expand in multiple countries, not many countries outside the US will really enjoy their products which are very expensive for most of the countries in the world.

598,Finley0578,0.0,3.0,"RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. is a global defence technology company focused on proprietary radar and legacy avionics systems. The company, which includes RADA Electronic Industries and its U.S-based subsidiaries, engages in the development, manufacture, and sale of systems designed primarily for the defence and aerospace markets. \[4\] Its product lines include tactical radars, inertial navigation systems and avionics systems. It offers software-defined, tactical radars for enhanced survivability of stationary and on-the-move operations. Founded in 1970, RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. has been traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market since 1985. History: RADA Electronic Industries was founded in 1970 by David Reitner. In 1998, owing to pressure from Boeing, Niessenson retired from his position as CEO of the company. Herzl Boedinger, who was RADA's international marketing manager and president of the U.S.-based subsidiary, and who had earlier served as commander of the Israeli Air Force, became president and CEO of RADA. In 2007, Zvi Alon, who was vice president of marketing and sales and had in the 1980s been involved in the Lavi Project, took on the role of CEO. In November 2016, RADA Electronic Industries announced the appointment of Dov Sella, its chief business development officer, as the company's executive officer. Since 2016, the company is focused on developing, manufacturing and selling software defined, tactical radar systems for multiple applications such as Active Protection Systems (APS) for combat vehicles, Short-Range Air Defence (SHORAD) for the manoeuvre force (including Counter-UAS), and Counter Rockets/Artillery/Mortars (C-RAM) systems. In 2017, the company supplied over a hundred radar systems to the United States Marine Corps. In 2018, the radars were integrated into Rafael's advanced anti-drone defence system for the British Army C-UAS capability. into Leonardo DRS mission equipment package (MEP) for the US Army Initial Manoeuvre-Short Range Air Defence (IM-SHORAD) capability, into an anti-drone warfare system for the United States Department of Defence against unmanned aerial system (UAS) threats, and into the Israeli Iron Fist Active Protection System for the US Army Bradley Brigade. In addition, RADA opened headquarters and a manufacturing facility in Germantown, Maryland (RADA USA), to locally develop the market of tactical radars for U.S. Defence Forces. In 2019 RADA's radars took part in various defence missions, including the knock-down of an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz by the United States Marine Corps all-terrain vehicle, which was equipped with an anti-drone detection and jamming system. The growing demand for tactical radars together with the increase in sales by RADA USA, led to the doubling of the yearly revenue and of the share price. In 2020, General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) was awarded a $1.2 billion contract by the U.S. Army to produce, test and deliver IM-SHORAD systems, which integrates RADA’s Multi-mission Hemispheric Radar (MHR). Products: ● aCHR (Advanced Compact Hemispheric Radar) ● MHR (Multi-mission Hemispheric Radar) ● ieMHR (Improved and Enhanced Multi-mission Hemispheric Radar) ● exMHR (Enhanced and Extended Multi-mission Hemispheric Radar) ● DVDR &amp; GDS (Digital Video, Data Recorder &amp; Ground Debriefing System) ● R-200M (Mems-based Inertial Navigation System) 

Price: The current price for 1 share of RADA (rada electronic industries) is $12.30 as of 03/04/2021 21:07. Returns: The 1 year return as of today is 157.14%. 5yr: 1641.94%. Since IPO: 12.50%. 

Risks:

● Big market swings. In 1993 the share declined from all time highs of $140.62 and declined to $39.38 before several tries to rally again, but in 2016 the share price reached all time lows of $0.60

● RADA is not used to market trends. ● RADA has a volatility of 4.21, 5.33 times more than the DOW.

600,RollingGreens,0.0,11.0,"I am mainly posting this to see if I'm missing something or perhaps gravely underestimating the power that this Googl privacy change will have on $TTD and internet advertising as a whole.

If you've been following $TTD the last few weeks they recently obliterated through earnings and revenue to the tune of 97% EPS beat and \~10% revenue beat. The dip that followed is actually pretty typical of TTD stock as analysts digest earnings and then the stock usually rallies...which it did until the last two JPow speeches. In part of the broad based NASDAQ sell off $TTD was dragged as expected, however the next day when the NASDAQ was still selling, albeit at a lower pace, $TTD was plummeting on an overall sentiment change in Tech and the GOOGL privacy changes.

What makes this all interesting to me is this - the GOOGL privacy change has been known for over a year (see CEO of $TTD address this over a year ago in January of 2020: [https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/knowledge-center/in-human-terms-episode-9-google-chrome-announcement](https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/knowledge-center/in-human-terms-episode-9-google-chrome-announcement)). The latest revelation about browsing histories really isn't the seismic shift the market is saying it is as of this week - this has been expected for some time. The other argument I hear is that GOOGL added to their privacy press release skepticism over UID 2.0 which $TTD has been spearheading for greater privacy concerns...hmmmmm why would GOOGL knock a competitors approach to something they lagged on and are now trying to jetison as they try and become the ""standard"" for privacy concerns they've violated for the better part of a decade? When the EU started cracking down on Privacy way before the US this was a boon for $TTD...now the market is telling me it's a detriment?

Lastly, I figured that $TTD must rely solely, or heavily, on third party data that is being scrutinized? Although $TTDs platform does integrate with the largest and most robust third party data providers, it is not the pillar of their business that would lead to it's demise. In fact, one of their strongest products is adapting client first party data into useful advertising data. Hence their partnership with $WMT on developing their website advertising platform that will allow for manufacturers to advertise through $WMTs website during the customer experience to drive cross and upsells.

I am most definitely seeking confirmation bias but I am also looking for those to poke holes in what I'm thinking. Were they growing into their valuation? I would say yes, they were probably a bit ahead of their share price when it started decreasing, but given their YoY growth, high margins that are continuing, and positioning in a space that is only growing...I just feel like they are being over punished and that this is a buying opportunity more than it is a retreat from an ATH that will never be sniffed again.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Everyone seems to think that they are all gurus in trading, and they have the ""right"" answer. But, the reality is that there are over 1mil+ different ways to trade and be successful. It varies greatly depending on how ""active"" you are in your portfolio. Some people are in there 50 times per day, others maybe 1-2 times per month. What works for one person might not work for another, and so on.

Just because someone has an annual target over 10% doesn't mean they're crazy. Maybe they are in the group that checks their portfolio 50 times per day, and they flip stocks rapidly in the short-term for compounded gains. You think Wall Street day-job traders would accept only a 10% gain per year? lol... Just because someone only invests in blue-chips and not micro-cap stocks ""going to the moon!"" doesn't mean they don't like money. Maybe they just prefer less risk.

644,elvita12345,0.0,19.0,"# Overview 

Vital Farms is a certified B-Corp focused on ethically growing pasture raised eggs and butter. They do this by partnering with roughly 200 family farms that share the mentality of putting the welfare of the animals before anything else and engaging in sustainable farming practices. All of the farms are located in “The Pasture Belt”, an area notorious for favorable weather all year long.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Matt O’Hayer in 2007. He is the founder and former president of the Organic Egg Farmers of America and is still the Executive Chairman and Director of Vital Farms.

The current CEO is Russell Diez-Canseco. Previous work experience includes McKinsey &amp; Company, H-E-B Grocery, and the Central Intelligence Agency (he also has an MBA from Harvard University).

Other senior management members have extensive experience in the food industry.

The company has a 4.2 rating on Glassdoor (50 reviews), 88% approval of the CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and motivation with the company’s ethical mission. A few reviews complain about managers (not uncommon on Glassdoor) and about the company’s culture.

# Industry and competition 

Vital Farms is active in the highly-competitive and fragmented US food industry with a focus on retail consumers and a few partnerships with restaurants.

Notable competitors include Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ: CALM), Rose Care Farms and other major US egg producers.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

Vital Farms differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the ethical side of the production and farming of its eggs and dairy products. Customers and reviewers claim the products are of higher quality and of greater taste due to the production approach they’re taking. Customer reviews and satisfaction is extremely high (their standard egg carton has a 4.9 out of 5 rating on Amazon based on 5,985 reviews with customers praising the premium quality).

Although their eggs are pricier than competitors, consumers haven’t been minding shelling out the difference for the premium quality. 

Their marketing is unique and exceptional amongst competitors. To exemplify a part of this, they allow buyers to check out the farm where their eggs were laid in a 360 degree video to see if it’s up to snuff and they have a reward program for filling up a “pasture passport” with the names of 10 different farms.

Their branding and packaging is also really strong and although it is still a small company, it is starting to show strong brand loyalty among its consumers (a significant percentage of first-time buyers during the COVID-19 pandemic became repeat buyers according to the CEO).

Although the company does not have a truly strong moat at the moment, in my opinion they’re well on their way to building themselves one by the customer loyalty they’re amassing and the network of small farms they’re building.

# Areas of growth

The company has been willing and adventurous when it comes to expanding their product line into sub-products (Egg bites, hard boiled eggs, liquid whole eggs) and completely new segments (butter). A natural next-step for the company at this point, in my opinion, would be to expand their dairy products further (milk, cream, etc.) to tap into other large markets.

Partnerships with large restaurant chains willing to back sustainable farming practices could also be a catalyst for growth.

One could argue there is also potential internationally for Vital Farms, but I believe this is very far-off the current road-map. 

# Potential headwinds 

As previously mentioned, the industry they operate in is highly fragmented and it’s unlikely Vital Farms will own a majority of market share in their segment. The egg and dairy industry is also notoriously smaller and has a lower CAGR than other high-flying fast-growing industries, so Vital Farm’s TAM and market cap growth is capped unless they manage to go international successfully or tap into new product and revenue streams.

The stock UWMC fell to around 8.50 at one point today. Around then I purchased 10x March 19th call options at a strike of $10 for a premium of 55 cents. Essentially paying $550 (before commision) for those 10 contracts. 

My question is regarding what my options are for these two scenarios.

Scenario 1: The stock rises to $9.50 in the next few days, making my options in the money, but not at the set strike price. 

Should I sell these on the open market? How do I go about selling these options on the open market? And do I need any additional liquidity?

Scenario 2: The stock rises to or above the strike price by or before the exercise date. 

 Should I exercise the option and at what price would I be purchasing the shares? Do I need the liquidity to purchase those shares? Would it be ""freeriding"" of I did not have the liquidity and sold the shares  I purchased to cover the cost of the options? Is it possible to sell the options instead of exercising them, even after the stock has risen above the strike price?


Last question, if I understand things correctly, I would have 3 days to transfer money into my account to cover any debt I owed from the purchase of the shares to exercise the option.

1 bought 1 stock, and watched it all day long. I ended the day in the green. Next day i bought another stock, and again ended the day in the green on both.
Day 3 saw some losses, but not enough to wipe out the overall profits.
The next week i bought a much cheaper stock, which i had been watching sit around 23 cents a share. It slowly dipped towards 20 cents over a week, but recovered. So i set myself a limit buy of 19 cents, being ever the optimist. The order sat for a week unfilled, so i upped to 20 cents, as it was getting to 21. I grew impatient and upped to 20.5 to get in. 45 minutes later it was at 20. The next day it reacged my original want of 19. That was the start of this week.

I am interested in getting into debit spreads. I've got a trade in mind, but something about the break even price does not make sense to me, so I am seeking guidance here on r/stocks :)

My plan is to buy the $80 call on XOP expiring 1/22/22 for $16.95 and sell the $90 call option with the same expiration for $12.53 for a net debit of $4.42.

My understanding is that this trade has a max loss potential of $442.00 per contract, and a max profit potential of $558.00 per contract.

My understanding of the break even price calculation is the lower strike price plus the debit. In this case, $84.42. The thing is, XOP is currently trading at $86.80. How can the break even price on this spread be below the current stock price? If that were true, it seems you could just buy and sell these spreads for profit to infinity.

**What is KTOS?** 

Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions is a California based “security solutions” provider. Their business is a bit hard to describe as its pretty diversified. At their core, they develop defense products, systems and hardware for the US government and other agencies; meaning they have their hands in a wide range of technologies. So, they make ISR drones, VR training, Satellites, missiles, radars, aircraft etc. What I'm most excited about going into the future is their involvement into the aerospace industry.

**Track Record:** 

KTOS has secured -and seemingly will continue to secure- several defense contracts from the US government. 

* Just nine hours ago they secured an[8.9 million dollar](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-04/kratos-awarded-8-9-million-contract-for-ch-47f-chinook-maintenance-training-systems-enhancements) contract for some maintenance training 
* On Feb. 19th they secured a [55 million dollar](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-02-19/kratos-receives-55-million-c5isr-system-product-award-from-national-security-customer) contract for their C5ISR System; a KTOS division “related to hardware, products, systems and solutions in support of unmanned drone,  space and satellite  communications,  radar,  missile defense,  high  power  energy, strategic deterrence and  other systems” 
* Last December they got a [37.7 million dollar](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-377-million-skyborg-program-contract-award-usaf) contract for some unmanned combat aerial vehicles 
* And a [38.7 million dollar](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/naval-air-systems-command-exercises-option-additional-387) contract that same month from the Navy for some Subsonic Aerial Targets.

They have some more contracts too, all ranging from the 10-25 million dollar range. [Looking at their 4th quarter fiscal and financial results](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2020-financial-results), the company seems to be in good financial shape as well, with steady upward growth.

&gt;Fiscal 2020 Revenues of $747.7 million increased 4.2 percent, as compared to Revenues of $717.5 million in fiscal 2019, reflecting organic growth... 

and

&gt;Kratos ended 2020 with a 1.4 to 1.0 book to bill ratio for the year, including 1.4 to 1.0 in our Unmanned Systems business, a record backlog and an opportunity pipeline of $9 billion, providing us with confidence and visibility to our expected future growth trajectory and representative of the success of the investments we have made.

In short, KTOS appears to be a solid (albeit smaller) defense company with solid financials. 

**Future Growth** 

Personally, I believe KTOS has a lot of room for growth in a variety of younger industries such as autonomous technology and aerospace. If you don't believe me, believe Cathie as its part of her ARKQ fund ([https://ark-funds.com/arkq](https://ark-funds.com/arkq))

From Kratos’ CEO in the fiscal statement linked above: 

&gt;As we begin 2021, approximately 60 percent of Kratos business is focused on innovative and disruptive Space, Satellite Communications and Unmanned Systems, which are expected to be some of our fastest growing and highest profit margin business areas...We also continued to integrate and test multiple systems and payloads into each of Kratos’ family of affordable, high performance drones flying today, further expanding our first to market leading position, and we remain highly confident of the ultimate transformational success of this business.

Also note that Cathie is releasing her ARKX fund soonish; date hasn't been released yet. While there is no guarantee that KTOS will be a part of that fund (I highly suspect it might); preluding/following its release you’re probably going to see an uptick in aerospace stocks in general, including KTOS. Even if you don't believe in the future profitability of this company, this still feels like a good buying opportunity. KTOS has years of experience developing autonomous and aerospace tech; so they’re primed to capture market shares in these industries if they take off. 

**Cons:** 

KTOS is a bit of a small fish in a pond full of big fishes. Their main competitors would probably be Lockheed Martin (market cap 94.74B), Boeing (market cap 131.01B) or Honeywell (market cap 141.14B). Kratos has a market cap of 3.10B. While you could look at this as a possible path for KTOS to take, it could also be indicative of KTOS trying to enter a crowded market. There's also a chance that space exploration goes the way of the atomic age and never really becomes a large industry. Also, the ethical considerations. At the end of the day while they are invested in other industries, KTOS also makes machines meant to kill people. You're just going to have to make your peace with that when investing in a defense company. Im not sure about any other cons in terms of their financials, but Im not very adept at reading balance sheets yet. Double check that if you wanna

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think that they have the potential for a-lot of steady growth the next few years. They're definitely a stock to hold for the long-term, but they have the potential for huge payoff if you stick with them imo.

- Cryptocurrency rise and new GPUs all around, selling for significantly higher than normal should also increase the market value. 

- There have been concerns about tariffs, but companies have already raised their MSRP accordingly, and they are still getting sold out instantly.  THIS SHOULD BE PRICED IN.

- production for semiconductors is being ramped up.

- new factories are being built, old processes are being restarted to meet demand *and they are selling those too*

- SOXL just had a split, which *should have* been good for the ETF

- AMD is releasing the new ryzen this month, and a new GPU was just announced.

- probably other stuff

-------background/my position ---------

I'm down 26% on SOXL, and I am in a position where it is like 30% of my portfolio (due to buying dips, averaging, and temporary investments turning into accidental holding the bag).

Avg price $40.85

I'm also down 10% for AMD and I have 30% of my portfolio in AMD (same reason as SOXL, holding the bag).

For context too, I am currently investing on savings as a student, with no other income currently. With no more buying power, I gain nothing from dips, unless I close other positions.

Tl;dr

Does anybody actually know why the semiconductor industry is consistently breaking away from the analysis and dropping right now? Is the semiconductor bull analysis still valid?  Should I abandon ship, or hold and try not to think about it?

TL;DR at the bottom.

This is the first DD I'm posting, let me know anything I should fix.

# Who is Corsair?

Corsair is a company that makes computer components such as fans, power supplies, SSDs, cases, coolers, RAM, and other peripherals. Since the pandemic, the gaming industry has seen huge growth with an influx of people looking for ways to spend time and the new dependence on home computers. It is my opinion that even after the pandemic, many will continue to purchase computer components and many will continue to work from home if possible.

# News.

Recently, Corsair has acquired Visuals by Impulse. Visuals is a streamer's tool to create overlays and alerts on their stream. With some streamers making millions of dollars per year, there is no doubt that streaming is an appealing prospect. In recent years, the number of active streamers has gone from around 3 million to 9 million with no signs of slowing down. The streaming industry is just getting started.

Streamers Per Year:

[https://imgur.com/a/WPUFhoE](https://imgur.com/a/WPUFhoE)

Corsair also released its earnings report on February 9th. Corsair beat their estimate but not expectations, so the stock dipped right after earnings from $44.70 down to $31.84 today. The tech selloff over the week has also affected the stock greatly. Other than that, the stock has been relatively quiet.

# Income and Revenue.

Corsair makes a majority of its revenue, $1.7bn up 55% from last year, from selling PC components(\~69%), and a good chunk of revenue comes from peripherals(\~31%). Corsair has seen consistent growth in revenue over the past couple of years and quarters.

Net Revenue was around 465 million, **up around 241 million from last year(\~192%).**

Net Income was at 103 million up from -8 million.

# Pros:

\- The price to book ratio is very low compared to the sector's(About 5 compared to 18).

\- The intrinsic value (at least according to my calculation) is higher than the current price even with a margin of safety of 10%.

\- Corsair is a very well respected brand in computers.

\- In the next few years, there will be big changes in the CPU market, and DDR5 RAM may come out, leading many to be looking for an upgrade.

\- The GPU shortage may end soon and people will be looking for PSUs to feed the GPUs and maybe fans and cases to better cool their PCs. Also, with the releases of the 3060 and AMD's equivalent coming soon to hopefully replace the 1060, many will be looking for new computer components. The 1060 currently makes up 9.62% of the GPUs used by Steam(gaming) users. With around 24% of Steam users using 3-4-year-old GPUs, there is no doubt that many will be looking for an upgrade soon. **KEEP IN MIND**, Corsair does **not** sell GPUs, but they sell items that are often purchased with GPUs.

\- Very high short float \~25% (Short squeeze?).

\- If you believe in Fibonacci retracements, Corsair is in the buy zone based on a 1-Year, 1-Day candle retracement from $22.97 to $51.26, -61.8% retracement puts the value at around $67.8.

# Cons:

\- There is a lot of competition in the industry, a lot of companies make SSD's, PSUs, RAM, etc.

\- Due to the silicone shortage, upgrading a PC is harder so it may lower the odds that people need new RAM, power supplies(power-hungry GPUs and CPUs), or cooling. This may be a good thing because once the shortage ends(hopefully), there should be a huge increase in the number of people purchasing products for their PCs.

\- I'm probably biased towards Corsair.

\- Current bearish momentum.

TL;DR: I'm bullish on Corsair in the long term, I believe that it is very undervalued right now. With changes coming to the computing industry, I see very big potential in the growth of Corsair.

Stocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent sellof. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021’s gains. 

The moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. 

* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. 
* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

As Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.

**Highlights**

* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. 
* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.
* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.
* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z will be added to the board of directors at Square.

**If you'd invested on 2nd September, it would've taken you till November 13th to go green again.**

Now that's just the S&amp;P500, I can't say for EV and Tech stocks on their own but the point still stands. Think why you've invested in the stocks you've chosen. Have you just gone off random advice on reddit without doing DD, or do you see a bright future for your companies?

Yes, **the market is overvalued,** yes there's warning signs of a crash, people panicking, media stirring it up, but the reality is no one knows what's going to happen next. **All you can do is judge your situation based on your own circumstances.**

If you've lost a lot of money recently in your portfolio **you have two options, realise your losses and accept it and learn from it, or wait a few months or years and hope that your portfolio recovers**. The option you choose depends on when you need your money, and how risky your stocks are and how much you can afford to lose. People love to see the upside of things but rarely factor in the downside. **This is your downside, you need to judge how much more of it you can take.**

If you've found it incredibly stressful watching your portfolio be in the red, maybe you need to **reevaluate whether investing is for you or the kind of investing you're doing or educate yourself on how to invest better,** there's lots of free resources out there to learn about analyzing stocks, what metrics to look at, etc.

**If you're a beginner investor, keep it simple**, don't just jump on the bandwagon or make trades you don't fully understand. You need some sort of system to follow to take your emotions out of the equation as much as possible.

It's easier said than done but I'd urge everyone to **be careful, leveraged trading, shorting and not diversifying are all surefire ways to land yourself in trouble.**

Do I think the stock market is about to crash or begin a long term bear market? No I don't but no one can be 100% certain. If there is a crash, it's likely that things will rally soon after. If you're scared to lose more than you can afford, then maybe cut some of your losses but if you can afford to wait and you believe in the stocks you've chosen then sit tight and it will all be alright.

As seen Vale has had consistent and strong growth the past few years with their total gross profit in 2020 being 20.979 Billion, a 28.05% increase from 2019.
Their PEG ratio is at 0.44 indicating to me the company is undervalued.
They have a current debt of around 2 billion but have cash reserves of around 8 billion so this does not seem like an issue to me.

Chart
The company has had two catastrophic tailings dam failures in Brazil: Mariana, in 2015, and Brumadinho, in 2019; the Brumadinho dam disaster caused the company to lose its license to operate eight tailings dams in Minas Gerais, and its stock to lose nearly 25 percent in value. 

This is the main reason I believe the stock is undervalued as I believe it is slightly damaged but definitely not broken.


The biggest selling point for me 

Their potential deal with Tesla

Their recent growth has been to be do with a potential iron shortage, iron being their main earner as well. A 54% rally since November has been fueled by a 33% surge in iron ore futures on possibilities of an early 2021 shortage

As Vale remains atop of the nickel miners, striking a deal with EV manufacturers individually, like Tesla, could prove mutually beneficial to both parties. While the agreement could be of a fixed-pricing nature, and less subject to the volatility of nickel futures, it would provide hefty streams of revenue to Vale as well as enough nickel to potentially manufacture millions of batteries.

Should Vale hypothetically strike an agreement to sell, say 30kt of nickel per year to an EV manufacturer like Tesla, using a slight premium to current futures at around $17000/t, that would provide $510 million in revenues to Vale per year, as well as the capability for the manufacturer to produce 1 million batteries, each requiring 30kg of nickel.
That 30kt of nickel would represent about one-quarter of Vale's potential production of class 1 nickel; if Vale ends up selling more, up to one-third or higher (40kt to 50kt), that could rake in $680 million to $850 million at $17000/t; that would also provide enough nickel to make nearly 1.7 million batteries.

They have no issues with management as far as I can see and I believe they are recovering from their mistakes which is making them undervalued.

IMO the future of cars is going to be all electric and Vale looks like it has a good chance of monopolising the Nickel market. This is because nickel greatly increases the energy density of the batteries.

TLDR
IMO Nickel is going to play a very large part in the future and Vale has the best credentials to be the supplier for all the major electric car companies in the future.

First,  what it isn't: Treasury yields.  Don't listen to the news.  This just means that no one wants to buy bonds so the price of bonds is going down to attract new investors.  This happens in a healthy economy.  Can't believe the fake news is really pushing this.

What I would see if this was anything other than a correction:

Consumer cyclical and natural resource holdings would increase with major  investment firms.  Positions in small cap stocks would decrease.  Real  estate holdings would increase.

How I know these things aren't happening:

It's  best to track these activities through major firms and ETFs.  I track SPY's holdings daily.  They have teams of analysts and resources I just  don't have.  They're the first to know.  I do not watch the news for  financial information.

So what is it?

I  see firms reorganizing portfolio's for a post-C19 market.  IE, aerospace and defense stocks are going up in the same time the Nasdaq was down 9%.  Travel stocks like JetBlue are also doing well in that time frame.

When will it stop?

Who knows, but it couldn't have been expected and it's too late to sell  high and buy low now.  I'm waiting it out.  I have been increasing  positions with remaining cash but I'm out going forward.

Will tech rebound?

Yes.   New tech is where the money is.  I see strong cross-sector growth continuing through Q3 this year.  Q1 industrial is very strong so far.   Many of these up and coming tech companies are going to be pushing into  their manufacturing phases.

How bonds work since many don't understand (I don't blame them):

The  ""price"" of bonds go down as demand goes up and goes up when the demand  goes down.  Think of it this way, the lower I sell my bond, the less  money I have to spend in the long run as a bond ""seller"".  As a buyer, I  get more money if I buy a bond with a high rate of return vs low.  So  you won't sell many bonds with a low rate.  Thus, if bonds need to be  sold, the rate goes up.  This is an indication that no one is buying  them and the money is likely going to the market or being held as cash.    Thus, a yield from a bond is how much money you'll make based on the  rate of return.  This is reflected in the Treasury Yield curve.  The   curve itself reacts faster with short-term bonds than long-term bonds.    If they cross, this can be a bad indication of rapid market changes.   The safest investment in the entire world is a US Treasury Bond.  That's  for two main reason: first, it's never lost anyone money; second, the  US has the ability to tax the wealthiest population on the planet if  anything happens.  So what that means, people put their money in US  bonds when they think things aren't going well.  When things are going  well, they get out of them and put the money back in the market.",stocks,No need to panic,35.0,0.73

**Q4 2020 Financial Results - The Good Stuff**

* I want to start this post actually with the positives for the company from the latest earnings. Numbers are from their [latest shareholder letter](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/169142121000019?cik=1691421)
* From 2019-2020, Lemonade’s **in force premium, increased by 87%** from $114 million to $213 million
   * This was driven by **higher premiums per customer ($213 in Q4 2020 vs $177 in Q4 2019)** and an impressive **56% year-over-year increase in number of customers (which now sits at \~1 million)**
      * If you’re not familiar with insurance, **premiums** are just the amount customers pay each month, so if you pay $10 a month for renter's insurance, your monthly premium is $10
      * The **in force premium is annualized,** so in our previous example, your in force premium would be $10 a month times 12 months which equates to $120 for your in force premium
   * Lemonade **started off as a disruptive rentals insurance company** but has since then launched new products including **homeowners, pets, and life insurance** and this is how the company has been able to increase the premium it charges per customer by cross-selling its products to the same customer
* The company also grew their **gross earned premium to $50 million** which represents a 92% year over year increase
   * Gross earned premium represents the amount of the in force premium Lemonade collects once the service is fully delivered
   * So for example, if a customer pays $10 on January 1st for 1 month of rental insurance, Lemonade's gross earned premium is $0 and only becomes $10 once the full month of January has passed
* The company’s **annual gross loss ratio also fell from 79% to 71%** (Q4 2019 to Q4 2020), signaling better operating margins
* Basically, Lemonade has experienced an increasing customer base, has been charging more per customer, leading to higher in force premiums
* In addition to this, management strongly hinted that it’s working on a new product that will launch later this year, and it’s most likely going to be car insurance (watch towards the end of this [video from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/02/lemonade-ceo-on-the-companys-quarterly-earnings-and-new-offerings.html) with LMND’s CEO)
   * This could be a significant revenue driver for the company and I do like that Lemonade is expanding aggressively into multiple products as long as the company can grow its customer base

**Q4 2020 Financial Results - The Bad Stuff**

* The first thing I need to do is set the stage by explaining the **company's sky-high valuation to explain why the stock plummeted 16% after earnings**
   * Right before earnings, the company was trading at $132 per share, which gave the company a market cap of $8.5BN. Adjusting for the company’s cash of $1.2BN (incorporates company’s latest follow-on offering), the company had an **enterprise value of $7.2BN**
   * In the most recent quarter, the company guided to a midpoint of $115.5 million in 2021 revenue. **This meant Lemonade was trading at a 63x 2021 revenue multiple,** which is higher than pretty much all of the fastest growing software companies in the world
      * Here’s a [list](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2172588b-b60a-427d-9815-f523942b2183_1145x631.png) of some of the fastest growing software companies in the world for reference
   * But that’s the thing, Lemonade is **NOT** a software company. Many hype investors forget that it’s an **insurance company f**irst and foremost
      * The most obvious proof of this is in the company’s **gross margins** which jumped in the latest quarter to 37%, but for the **full year of 2020 was at a very sub-par 26%** (vs. 70%+ for a good software company)
* Given that Lemonade is trading at a revenue multiple higher than pretty much all of the best software companies, **Lemonade really needed to crush earnings in order to propel its stock further.** It did not:
   * While customers have increased year over year by 56%, if you take a [closer look at the quarter by quarter data,](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet027.jpg) Lemonade added \~60K new customers, which is the smallest increase in the past 2 years
      * And [it’s not like the company is spending any less in marketing](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet021.jpg), which is pretty much in line with previous quarters
      * The reduction in customer growth is something I would really worry about as a Lemonade investor because that is what is the true driver of the company’s growth
   * In addition, to all of this, about **a quarter of Lemonade’s customers are in Texas,** which as you probably know was recently hit with a huge power outage
      * In the latest earnings call, management stated that there will be a spike in its gross loss ratio but no material affects to its financials, which I personally find a little hard to believe
   * Some may also point to the company’s [improvement in its operating expense margin](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet034.jpg) when compared to its gross earned premium and it’s true that it’s gone from negative 156% to negative 89% (lol)
      * But the $44.5 million spent in Q4 2020 earned the company a total of just $7.5 million in gross profit (pretty terrible unit economics)
      * Personally, I’m okay with companies during their growth stages spending tons of cash and being unprofitable, but given Lemonade’s slowing customer growth and poor gross and operating margins, Lemonade’s insanely high valuation cannot be justified
* Combined with all this, I do have to mention that the stock is also largely down the recent jump in bond yields, which punishes growth stocks, especially the ones overvalued

**What I Think Lemonade’s Stock Price Should Be**

* If we take a look at some of the [fastest growing tech stocks](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2172588b-b60a-427d-9815-f523942b2183_1145x631.png) in the world, of which all are growing quickly and have gross margins in the 70s or above, then I think it’s safe to say that at maximum, Lemonade deserves to be trading at a 35x next twelve months (i.e. 2021) sales which I think is still generous
   * **If we assume a 35x 2021 sales multiple,** then given LMND’s guidance of 2021 revenue to $115.5mm (midpoint of $114-$117mm), then we get to an enterprise value of \~$4BN
      * After we add back $1.2BN in cash, we get to an estimated market cap of $5.3BN which when you divide by Lemonade’s fully diluted shares comes out to a **$82.68 share price which represents a \~13% drop** (LMND currently trades at $93 at time of post)
   * But, I think 35x is a really generous multiple given that the company’s growth is in question and has poor margins and believe **the company should be truly trading closer to 20x,** which gives us a share price of **$55.57**
* Now do I think the stock will go down to $55? I think if bond yields continue to push higher and we have a big tech correction, I definitely think it’s possible but probably not likely given how irrational the market has been these past few years
   * Also, any reversal in bond yields will likely push the stock up but I believe over time, the stock will fall to a more reasonable level into the \~70s and so I personally do not recommend buying the dip

\*\*1. $AMRS - Amyris\*\*

Amyris is one of the most complex companies on the market. I won't even bother trying to explain everything myself. But here is a quick summary. The company uses  machine learning to guide their biotechnology, and they use biotechnology to manufacture molecules very easily and cheaply, where the alternative is extracting it from nature or convoluted ""legacy"" manufacturing processes. For example, there are only two ways to get the chemicals squalene and squalane. A) Kill a shark or B) go to Amyris. And that is just one ingredient, where Amyris is manufacturing dozens of ingredients, and each of those ingredients are being leveraged in dozens of products. The most notable is Biossance, one of the fastest growing beauty brands.

They have so many other segments it would take a novel, so just trust me or read the link. Anyway, over the past year they have cut their debt by 60%, grown revenues by over 50%, and finished the year with $170M in revenues. They project $400 M for next year, and are now self funding, something not true for any other non-pharmaceutical biotech on earth (ie: all biotechs other than the ones making drugs). This is an enormous growth opportunity as they will easily dominate several manufacturing markets for years to come. There are some good articles out there on the internet that dissect this company further.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2. $KLR - Kaleyra\*\*

This one is easy. It’s literally just a smaller Italian Twilio. I call them Pizza-Twilio.

Communication+analysis services is becoming a huge business in the B2B segment.

Both Twilio and Pizza-Twilio do the same thing. Twilios current price is x45 their current sales. Pizza-Twilio’s current price is only approx x3 sales. Now valuations are assigned for a reason and KLR hasn’t earned a x45 multiple until they start growing faster, but still. There’s a whole lot of numbers between x3 and x45. Even x10 is a pretty conservative multiple that would give you huge profits at this price.

Communication as a Service is an incredibly crowded industry and it will be a grind forever. I have no illusions that Kaleyra will ever end up comfortably on top all by itself. However, the industry is still so undeveloped. It is very much a race to capture new markets. One company can't possibly capture every market, since it is a sales-based industry. That means Twilio has to actually send their sales dudes out to places or set up zooms, meaning only so many customers can be gained at once. Which is all to say that Kaleyra will be just fine even if they don't beat Twilio or other competitors. They are very well positioned to dominate a few markets, namely India and the spicy parts of Europe (Italy, France, etc...). So far, they are doing exactly that. Q4 2020 India revenues are up 36% from the prior year. Q4 2020 USA revenues are up 100% from the prior year. Overall, 24% revenue growth.

And all of this was true before 2 weeks ago when they acquired mGage, a wireless company that will allow KLR to sell its mass-text and calling services at much better margins since it will now have direct access to several major wireless networks in the US and Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3. $DIS - Disney\*\*

I don't need to explain Disney's business to you. The bull case here is very simple. The market has always given an enormous premium to companies with recurring service revenues. That's why companies like Microsoft trade more richly than companies like IBM or Intel. I predicted this phenomena 2 years ago with Apple, that's why I heavily advocated buying Apple (again, check my history). Now the same thing is about to unfold here. Netflix has a Price/Sales ratio of 9.5 and a PE of 86. Disney has a price/sales of 5.6. Their PE is a little bonkers due to park closures but when the dust settles in a year or so, PE would be around 40-50 if the market cap is unchanged. If Disney+ becomes Netflix, then the upside is double.  If Disney+ becomes even half as successful as Netflix, then that means a third of Disney would be streaming. .33 \* 9.5 + .66 \* 5.5 = 6.5 price/sales, or 16% upside \*on top\* of their regular growth from parks, media, etc... That is crude and oversimplified math but the point remains. Their multiple \*is\* going to change.

What's more is that Disney has one enormous advantage over Netflix and other competitors, in that it already owns the media it is displaying. For Disney, content creation is a sunk cost because they were doing that anyway. While Netflix has to spend billions every year on original content JUST for streaming, Disney is already creating that content regardless. Basically, Disney is profiting 3 times off the same content expenses: in parks, in theaters, and on streaming services. Netflix doesn't have that economic efficiency and never will. I don't know if theaters will still be as relevant in 2 years. But either theaters rebound or the streaming market triples, because all that entertainment viewing demand has to go \*somewhere\*, and those are the only two media options that are viable right now. Either way, a win for Disney.

Plus they have a dividend. If you are risk averse then Disney is my top pick on the ""stable side"" of stocks.

It beat last quarter’s earnings by 2.4x predictions, and upcoming earnings will be the catalyst needed to make ASO skyrocket. Guns are a major part of their sales, and January 2021 had the 3rd highest single-month gun sales recorded in US history.

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

**Fundamental Analysis:**

**Gun Sales**

Academy Sports and Outdoors is focused on selling hunting, fishing, and camping equipment. A major point of interest in this company is its gun sales. So long as ASO continues to go down the path of marketing and selling guns, they will continue to grow, especially in today's climate. Gun sales are up in January from previous months, with the third-highest monthly total of gun sales on record ([Gun sales surged 80 percent in January, data shows - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)). On top of that, the number of NICS Firearm Background Checks is up 30.53% from last year’s monthly average, from 3,307,943 background checks per month in 2020 to 4,317,804 in January 2021 ([NICS Firearm Checks: Month/Year — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)).

CEO Ken Hicks claims that many people picked up new hobbies such as hunting, fishing, and camping, which has helped drive sales. And if only 20-30% of those people continue with those hobbies, it will greatly help their sales ([Academy Sports CEO says hobbies acquired during COVID will continue to drive sales in 2021 - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-ceo-says-hobbies-acquired-during-covid-will-continue-to-drive-sales-in-2021-11608054715)). Especially if many are scared of future potential gun restrictions created by the Democrat-controlled Congress, now could be a time where we see a surge of gun purchases before any restrictions are made, which would drive ASO sales.

Location-wise, ASO is in the perfect position to continue making sales year-round. Located in the South, people can continue their outdoor activities throughout the winter, providing ASO with sales when it may not otherwise have been able to if it were located further north.

**IPO and Leadership**

In 2011, KKR bought out ASO, however, ASO recently went public on October 2, 2020. Led by CEO Ken Hicks, ASO is well-positioned to continue boosting its sales. As CEO at Foot Locker, Hicks helped reverse three years of negative same-store sales, and he brings his experience in other executive positions to the table ([Academy Sports + Outdoors Announces Ken C. Hicks as Chairman and CEO - ASO](http://corporate.academy.com/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-ken-c-hicks-as-chairman-and-ceo/index.html)).

ASO is clearly focused on growth, rather than maintenance. Effective Jan 29, 2021, ASO eliminated the COO position at ASO “in order to create a more efficient operating structure and focus on key strategic priorities” ([Academy Sports eliminates COO role - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-eliminates-coo-role-2021-01-21)). It is focused on increasing its efficiency and sales. This is also indicated by the fact that it just went public, meaning it intends to use the money gained from its public offering to help grow the company.

**Stimulus Bill**

The $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that was passed by the House on Feb 2, 2021, would be a huge boost to the company if it were to pass the Senate. This is not exclusive to ASO, but it would help the overall economy, and give more disposable income for people to spend, and help boost sales.

[Financials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14d-1TgdKxr_Bz1f3yDdQ6Uclt04MxzXJivPQmDEUirw/edit?usp=sharing) **(obtained from Yahoo Finance; click title for link to spreadsheet)**

This is a key part of my valuation of ASO. It displays how criminally undervalued ASO is a company relative to the market as a whole, as well as its competitors. I have linked a google spreadsheet to this post that shows several key indicators as to why ASO is undervalued relative to its competitors. I will compare ASO’s financials to Dick’s Sporting Goods, as they are the most similar competitor.

ASO’s trailing P/E ratio is currently 10.82, as compared to DKS’ 17.56

ASO’s forward P/E is 9.78, as compared to DKS’ 14.9

ASO’s P/S (ttm) is 0.41, as compared to DKS’ 0.74

ASO’s P/B (mrq) is 2.29, as compared to DKS’ 3.15

Additionally, its most recent actual earnings (0.91 eps) were 2.4x its predicted earnings (0.39 eps), and its predicted earnings for next quarter are 0.48 eps, still well below last quarters earnings ([ASO 23.96 -0.78 -3.13% : Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO?p=ASO)).

**Debt**

ASO’s debt is one of their few worrisome financial indicators. They have a great deal of debt, with their debt to equity ratio sitting at 272.59 (as compared to DKS’ 150.66). However, ASO has already designated around $200 million obtained from their IPO to help pay off some debt ([Is This Retail IPO a Winner? | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/17/is-this-retail-ipo-a-winner/)). They also have the ability to pay off short-term debt, so I do not see this as a company that will likely go bankrupt. Their current ratio (mrq) is 1.61 and although this is significantly lower than many other gun-related companies, it is actually lower than DKS’ 1.4, which shows that they do in fact have the ability to show off their short-term debt.

**Short Interest**

While I am not a fan of solely using short interest as an indicator to invest in a stock, it can still be a helpful tool. According to [S3 Research](https://www.shortsight.com/category/s3-research/), ASO’s short interest as a percentage of its float is 28.18%, as compared to DKS’ 14.97%. Both of these are fairly high, and show that there is great short interest against both these companies. Although I strongly believe that there will not be a sudden short squeeze, over time I believe that sustained stock price growth will force investors to cover their short positions, and will definitely help fuel ASO’s stock price growth.

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

**Technical Analysis:**

ASO has been following a strict channel since its IPO in October as seen below. It has bounced off support and resistance multiple times, but still remains in this channel. ASO is currently hitting the bottom of the channel, and I believe it will soon bounce back. This is a perfect stock for MMs to manipulate and keep in this channel, with small volume and sizeable bid-ask spread:

[https://imgur.com/zhOcwag](https://imgur.com/zhOcwag)

This channel has major support. At the end of January 2020, ASO announced its secondary offering, and the stock price plummeted, only to hit support and bounce right back:

[https://imgur.com/zon7KdW](https://imgur.com/zon7KdW)

This channel has some extremely strong support, and ASO is the perfect stock for MMs. It has a low volume, high bid-ask spread, and high institutional ownership (sitting at about 75%).

So my question is then why has the stock market had such a tumultuous few weeks?

These summary of points below come from the 30-year mortgage rate article on [WSJ.com](https://www.wsj.com/articles/30-year-mortgage-rate-tops-3-for-first-time-since-july-11614870208?mod=hp_lead_pos2) but I've seen very similar commentary over the past 2 weeks from other articles and publications.

* There is economic optimism in the market related to the vaccine roll out and the relief bill/stimulus.
* As a result, investors are confident and are selling bonds (causing interest rates to rise) to move into riskier options (such as stocks).

Yield rates spiking up has spooked the market over the past week, and the general interpretation has been that it's a result of more government spending and the expectation of future inflation ... a prospect I'm personally slightly dubious about outside of asset inflation, but that's another story.

However, I'm aware that SPACs have become very popular lately and that on some level they are simply baskets of treasury bills which has me wondering if activity around SPACs could be significant enough to move the needle one way or the other when it comes to yields?

Just a random thought. Tell me it's stupid if you like. Give me some resources to look into all the activity and money involved with SPACs if you've got it.

758,Bl1zza,0.0,27.0,"Clover Health stock price has gone way beyond the limits of stupidity. I know the markets can be irrational, but this is something else. 

So Clover has been nosediving eversince the Hindenburg short-report (or hitjob). Hindenburg is probably best known for their short report on Nikola (credits to them on that one), but everyone knew that Nikola was all show and talk before their report so idk how much credit that brings them. They’ve shorted a bunch of companies the past year and most of them are up over triple digits since their short reports.

Anyways, even though Clover is facing class action lawsuits, I do not see it as anything critical or fundamentals changing to either the company or the stock. Corporate lawsuits are as common in America as mosquitoes are in the swamps. 

Some basic info of the stock: P/S under 2, short interest ~30%, market cap barely above $1B, revenues will be close to $1B this year, revenue CAGR was 45,6% from 2019. 

Clover became public through the reverse merger route that shall not be mentioned here, under the ticker IPOC, one of Chamath’s blank checks. Chamath sees them as a disruptor in tha NA healthcare space. Whereas Clover’s closest competitors have growth rates of ~10%, Clover has ~50%. 

It’s understandable that Clover took a hit after the short report, but that in combination with the current blood-market, Clover’s valuation has dropped to laughable levels. The average price target for $CLOV is $14,33. That’s quite the jump from the current $7,82. And mind you that is a very conservative price target for a high-growth company (and a Chamath company). I personally expect this to recover back to the mid-to-high teens during the next couple of months and chase 30s or 40s by EOY. 

This obviously is a higher risk play, but because of the insane drop in the share price I believe the reward way outweighs the risk.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is a non-professional overview of a company and stock I have belief in. I opened a position representing about 25% of my portfolio  at avg price of $7,83.",stocks,$CLOV - The Definition of Undervalued.,27.0,0.92
759,TayahuaJ,0.0,2799.0,"Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to ""re-opening"" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:

If a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.

Contrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. 

Think of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.

Conversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?

The point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. 

My two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft ""growth"" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. 

Kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.

Buy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.",stocks,Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.,2799.0,0.97
760,Floofyboy,0.0,132.0,"First of all, when you think about it, Nasdaq only lost 7% in a month. That means the huge majority of smart money is still holding and doesn't think there's a reason to panic. When smart money panics, you have the covid crash.


Secondly, its important to understand why there is so much red recently. The main reason is the fear due to the rising 10 year old treasury yield. When we woke up this morning, it did spike in a scary way, but now its going back down sharply, we are fine: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=^TNX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch


Now, even if this stupid 10 year old treasury yield did not go down, most people would agree these fears are irrational. Check this quick interview: https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/philadelphia-fed-harker-don-t-011809466.html


Historically, the rates, they go down, not up. The fear of massive interest rates are irrational, and as i said earlier, its only ~7% of people who are pulling out of nasdaq, that's a small number of people who's irrationally fearful. Feds have been under their target of 2% for a LONG time, they aren't concerned about this.


Additionally, Biden agreed to tighten the covid stimulus requirements. This is good news because it means its less likely to over heat the economy beyond control. And when that stimulus does get released, its hard to imagine it won't at least give a small boost to the markets.



I also think we need to look at the bright side. Historically, most crash happens when the market overheat. Corrections like we are having right now help avoid a real full breakdown of the market, and they help buy cheaper dips.

773,kayaarr,0.0,147.0," JAC Motor said Thursday it signed a letter of intent today with $NIO Holdings Ltd. to set up a joint venture.

The company, to be located in Hefei, is tentatively named Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing Technology (Anhui) Co (江来先进制造技术(安徽)有限公司). The name takes the first character of JAC's Chinese name and the second character of NIO's Chinese name.

The company plans to have a registered capital of 500 million yuan ($77 million ), with JAC contributing 51 percent and NIO 49 percent.

The company's board of directors will consist of five directors, three to be appointed by JAC and two by NIO. The chairman will be appointed by JAC and the vice chairman will be appointed by $NIO.

The joint venture will build a new ecology of ""advanced manufacturing + industrial internet"" with automation, networking and platform, relying on industrial internet and manufacturing management experience, JAC said.

The purpose of the joint venture is to integrate the advantages of JAC and NIO in manufacturing, production operation, quality control, supply chain management, to serve the manufacturing operation of products scientifically, JAC said.

The business scope of the joint venture includes manufacturing, R&amp;D and sales of electric vehicles and components; supply chain management; technical consulting and personnel training related to intelligent electric vehicles.

JAC emphasizes that the letter of intent for the joint venture is not legally binding and does not constitute an offer, and the two sides strive to agree and sign a formal agreement as soon as possible.

# This is the latest move by NIO to try to enter the lower-priced EV market with a new brand, and it looks more promising than any previous moves.

In April 2017, NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Changan Automobile, planning to set up a joint venture to develop new products together. The agreement at the time noted that the cooperation was different from JAC NIO's OEM model.

On August 17, 2018, the joint venture company Changan NIO was officially settled in Nanjing Jiangning Development Zone, with William Li, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO as chairman of Changan NIO and Li Wei, executive vice president of Changan Automobile, as vice chairman.

In December 2017, GAC Group and NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement, and in April 2018, GAC NIO was officially established.

However, so far, Changan NIO has not yet presented any new vehicle plans or clear development plans.

782,d20dndmemes,0.0,1.0,"$KHC

Kraft Heinz Corporation is the result of a 2015 acquisition by Kraft from Berkshire Hathaway, which had acquired Heinz and taken it private in 2013 for $23 Billion [I imagine one of the first comments to this post will be “William Buffett said he regretted buying Heinz!!!”. To clarify, William Buffett has said he felt he overpaid for Heinz in 2013. KHC had ~$26 Billion in sales in 2019, so arguments can surely be made either way. But the fact remains that KHC is the 5th largest holding of Berkshire Hathaway today. Buffett has a great track record of guiding his investments to new heights, so I’m just going to leave it at that.]

KHC is a consumer staples company with 38,000 employees and 2019 revenue of $26.19 Billion, which was 4.84% higher than 2018. KHC owns a stable of iconic brands including: Kraft, Heinz, Philadelphia, Planters, Jell-O, Lunchables, Velvetta, Maxwell House, Capri Sun, Kool-Aid and Ore-Ida. KHC products are ubiquitous and can be found in 97 out of every 100 households in America.

KHC, with I suspect guidance from the Oracle of Omaha, is undergoing a multi-year transformation aimed at streamlining its product lines (from 55 to just 6 major divisions) and reducing costs, while looking to expand into untapped overseas markets.  You see, in researching KHC I was shocked to learn that 80% of KHC’s $26.19 Billion in revenue comes from America and Canada. In retrospect I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised, as I can only personally recall seeing Heinz products in the UK.  But this is changing, and rapidly.  Since 2018 KHC has expanded in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in 2020 saw sales expand in those regions by 13%. Going forward, KHC hopes to penetrate the massive Chinese market and expects double-digit growth in all three of these emerging markets. One other thing that caught my eye, KHC has obviously taken notice of Beyond Meat and is piloting a line of plant-based protein products under the Heinz brand, one such product is called “Heinz Beanz Burgerz”. On a related note, they are partnering with Loop to do refillable condiment bottles (similar to the old practice of delivering milk in glass bottles) and they have designed fiber-based, recyclable Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese cup.

As an aside, I recently researched US chip manufacturers after Biden announced his 100 day study of supply chain issues. The vast majority of the leadership and board of directors at such companies are caucasian. So, I was very pleased to see the diversity in the leadership at KHC. My spouse is from South America, so seeing that Miguel Patricio is the CEO, and all the other Latin American members of leadership team, was a welcome breath of fresh air!

So, to recap- KHC is an iconic food company that has penetration in 97 out of 100 America households. The 2020 revenue was a whopping $26.19 Billion dollars, and 80% of that is from the US and Canada. KHC is going through a multi-year transformation that is expected to be completed in 2023. KHC wants to improve efficiencies across all operations and has begun to streamline its 55 product segments into just 6 divisions, the first and foremost being “Taste Elevation” with its iconic Heinz condiments. KHC plans to aggressively expand into foreign markets and expects double digit revenue growth in those markets. 

I stumbled across KHC while looking for value plays to park funds I’ve extracted from Tech plays. What I’ve found is a dividend-paying company that I will be holding on to for the next several years.

I fucking love soccer. This thing with the ball where just one player is allowed to touch it with his hands. Not where everyone is touchy touchy. So i looked up some stonks of these teams and i found #BVB.

Borussia Dortmund (BVB) is a german football club. Maybe mostly known for Jürgen Klopp (2008 – 2015) or some former players like Lewandowski, Kagawa, Pulisic, Aubameyang or Demebele. Right now players like Sancho, Hummels, Haaland and some really good youngster. Enough players, now a little bit history:

The stonk was released in the year 2000. In the Bundesliga they managed to finish in 3rd place and one year later in 1st place. They won it. One share was going up to like 8,50€. But the next years were complicated. They didn’t get any more trophys. They even tried it so hard, they spent all there money for average players. They tried so hard they almost run into an insolvency. 2005 a share was around 2€. It even fell to 1,50€ around 2009. But they started a turn around. They won two times in a row the Bundesliga and even managed to get tot he Champions League finale. A single share now got up to 3,70€. Not much, but it gets better. The next years they don’t mangaged to get back at the top oft he league. Bayern was too aggressive and too good. But they finished like every year at the 2nd place and developed „thousands“ of good players and sell them for a huge amount. BVB is now known as one of europes best opportunity for youngster the rise and shine. Example right now: Haaland (cost 25 Million, worth: over 100 Million), Sancho (cost around 8 Million, worth: over 100 Million). They managed to get the price for a share (without big sporting success) tob e at around 10€ PRE-COVID. Now they have some trouble like every business. No spectators are allowed to watch the games. Like almost every company the price of a share dropped down. Right now it’s around 5€.

And here i my thoughts. They managed to get their share to above 10€ without any great sporting success. Just because they developed good players and managed to play in the best european competition. They got a lot of money. In almost every year they managed to get more for selling their players than spending for new players without really losing any strengh.

Right now the stonk is staying around 5,70. In the past 5 Days it’s up 5% and the last month +10%. BVB still be in good position in Bundesliga and european competition. They sacked their coach this season but already got a new (better) one fort he next season. The only problem they are really facing ist he fact there are no spectators allowed. That’s the reason they have a negative balance in 2020 and mostly will have on in 2021 too. This will be history after vaccination and the comeback oft he spectators. So i feel like there is the opportunity this stonk will get back up to at least 10€ if they continue their work. And if they continue it it’s possible for BVB again to win some trophies. And if they manage to do that the stonk will even be able to rise higher than 10€.

I’m not an expert. I’m not even able to write in good english. It's not a hyped Stock like AMC or GME. So think and act for yourself. It’s a long game but i think it’s worth. I bought 1000 shares @ 5,20€.

Edit 1: The club announced a 45M loss due to COVID for the season 19/20. But this didn't seem to be a problem. They bought players for 48M while they sold players for only around 6M. So the 45M loss last season is of course not nice but no problem for the clubs financial.

This season they will face another loss due to COVID and no spectators. But like you said and i said before there are plenty of interesting players which could be sold to cover this loss without a problem. And i am not thinking about Haaland (he can leave BVB for 75M 2022; not before). More likely would be Sancho. But even here BVB showed some strenght. Last summer Manchester United offered Dortmund more than 100M for Sancho but wanted to transfer the money in 4 parts over the next 4 years. The manager just said all or nothing. They were able to resist a 100M offer because they dont want a installment payment. I think that showed a lot of their true financial strenght.

My opinion: if they will got into the champions league next season and this season will end without spectators the stock will constantly be around 5€. Even if they loose one or two good players to cover the loss for this season, the team will be good enough to cover that. I think it's a good chance here, the stock will go up to pre-covid around 10€. And long term - if the manager and the team will perform constantly - i think it could reach a little bit higher.

I just found an analysis from Edison Research: true value should be 12,55€ for the stock. They calculated with COVID as a reason for two seasons to have a big loss and after the two seasons to get back to normal.

Edit 2: There are a few clubs in europe which can produce such a amount of good players, sell them with high profit and still be good in european competitions: Porto, Ajax and Dortmund. But Dortmund also profits from the fact being an german club playing in one of the top tier leagues of european football.

I hope my thoughts about the stock of the club will come true. Football will always be the number one sport in europe. It will grow bigger and bigger and if BVB stays in their positions, they will grow too.

Having been known for owning “a shit ton of $PENN stock”, he was also one of the founder and CEO of Barstool Sports. He grew that business from basically nothing to the pop culture media giant it is today. While he is no longer CEO, he is Chief of Content where he oversees everything from podcasts and videos, to merchandise and social media presence. Everything this guy touches turns green.

Now that he’s backing this new $BUZZ ETF and will basically be the face of it, I don’t see how this business venture will be any different. It’s debuting today (Thursday, March 4, 2021) on the NYSE.

The $BUZZ ETF uses artificial intelligence to track the top 75 large-cap stocks each month based on positive social media chatter. The fund will hold stocks with market capitalizations of over $5 billion. Buzz Holdings Founder Jamie Wise said the Buzz Index came about seven years ago when the company launched a research project related to the growing prevalence of online communities and individual investors who were looking for a forum to share and collaborate ideas.

""The sentiment has always been something that's fascinated me personally,"" Wise said. ""So my thinking at the time was 'Well if more and more people are going to be going online and sharing their investment ideas and empowering themselves to make better investment decisions, there certainly must be some value in that information and wouldn't it be great to understand the collective conversation'.""

From there, Buzz Holdings saw considerable growth in data where the company could measure sentiment based on the social media posts it was observing.

Portnoy said he was approached by Buzz Holdings five years ago after the company's algorithm scraped positive social media chatter around PENN National Gaming. Portnoy noted that Buzz's algorithm, which has been licensed to investment firm VanEck's Vectors Social Sentiment ETF, outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 40% in 2020.

Last year, Penn National paid $163 million for a 36% stake in Portnoy's Barstool Sports. Penn National's sports betting app, is named after Barstool. The deal also calls for Penn National casino sportsbooks around the country to be rebranded ""Barstool"" and in a post-pandemic world, the casinos would feature Barstool’s stars holding pre-game and post-game parties at those sportsbooks whenever major sporting events return to normal for sports fans

Currently, the top ten holdings in BUZZ include DraftKings, Twitter, Ford, Facebook, Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, Advanced Micro Devices, Netflix and Tesla.

800,Maverick_WC,0.0,577.0,"Disclaimer: I am not predicting a crash or a correction, but am merely stating my opinion IF it does happen. 

The premise of buying and holding is that you are buying companies with good fundamentals and poised for continued growth in future. I have seen a lot of people on many posts saying that ‘they have done they DD’ which honestly is probably 30 mins on checking Reddit and Stocktwits for bullish sentiments instead of really downloading and reading the company’s financial records, future growth prospects etc. 

I think it is a good time to evaluate if your stock can handle a huge drop in price and still allows you to have conviction to keep holding. A lot of stocks are down 20-30%+ or more from their ATHs at this point, and if a crash or correction does happen (I believe NASDAQ is at or very near correction territory at about -10% from ATH), it’s going to see one crazy drop of -10-30% in a single day just like what happened in March. 

Can you handle it? If you can, the stock is a conviction pick for you. If not, perhaps consider buying something that you have truly done DD in. I have certain holdings that I believe to be dangerous when a correction or crash comes, like NIO, NET and JD (NET and JD have a growing consumer base and they will continue to grow, but at current market cap I deem it to be dangerous. NIO is super dangerous but it’s house money at this point since I got in at 15$ and sold more than half at 44$ long ago) But I got them at prices low enough to be able to withstand it even if they dropped more, they are a smaller % of my portfolio and I am willing to risk a loss for a more aggressive approach. 

I also have holdings which I will definitely add more if a crash does happen,like MWK and DIS. Tech is never going to be irrelevant after Covid, the transition to value stocks is temporary and it’s clear to me, so I am still ever so bullish on tech stocks and e-commerce. 

It’s obvious no one can be unaffected when you see your NLV drop, and that much is the same for me. However, at the end of the day, if this stock is something viable for years, buy and hold works, if it was a one time hype, reconsider your approach. I never got into green energy stocks because they are either mostly unprofitable or have no working product. Climate change and all is real, but it takes a lot of time to get there. Oil is still going to be a huge deal for decades regardless and I am quite tired of people having done ‘DD’ in some holdings that do not make any sense. 

Part of my holdings are aggressive,which makes it more volatile during a market correction. But ALL of my holdings are at least generating revenue and have a product that is being sold that I personally find to be indicative of what they are accomplish in future. I can never ever buy into a company that makes no revenue and I can only respect the balls of people who buys into such companies because they have strong belief that the company will be successful in that venture. If they buy at a point when the company is still in development, they definitely deserve a much better % in profits. I can never do that personally myself because I am not that ballsy.

The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel is a GREAT book that was released last year and talks about handling your money in the stock market. Please read it if you can, great book, has definitely helped me to manage my emotions in the stock market. No one loves taking a beating everyday, but some things are worth holding on to. 

I was there during march and all my holdings took a minimally 27% (I remember this number specifically because I was counting numbers that day) dive in a single day, I never sold and we recovered. It is great to buy and hold, statistics and numbers shows that it beats timing the market, but if only works if the company isn’t some overhyped unicorn crap. Please stay safe everyone and I hope for this to turn positive soon like everyone does.

I know it’s easy to feel isolated, especially now. But I love each and every one of you, and I don’t even have to know you personally because you are all my brothers and sisters from a cosmic perspective. 

If anyone is feeling down, please DM me and id be happy to chat. No one should suffer alone.

Also, I am not trying to offer a one size fits all solution to depression/anxiety. I was in a very dark place after my sister died and was dealing with a bunch of external pressures that exacerbated my anxiety/depression. I am just trying to give EXAMPLES of questions one COULD ask themselves if they are feeling stuck, from my perspective. 

I may be overly optimistic, but I believe the universe has a place for each of us and no harm can come from continuing to hope for a better tomorrow. Peace and love my brothers and sisters.

I just want to say you are a beautiful writer and what you said really resonated with me. “If I want to kill myself for some reason that is at its core superficial, maybe I should live for an equally superficial reason just to see what happens. Maybe the prospect that I can do what I know I’m capable of.” That is a very similar sentiment to absurdism by Albert Camus and honestly is a lens through which I see the world.

The fatty:

Onconova, Inc. has a potential cancer treatment (they can never say cure) that is being dragged down by Big Pharma via their investors. I can't say it's not been done, but so far there isn't anything (I could be wrong, please correct me) on the market that is able to kill a cancer cell while doing no damage to a human cell. They're very much the same molecularly. They created a molecule that's in stage-2 that inhibits cancer, and the (new) molecule (based on the stage-2 molecule) that kills cancer cells and does no harm to human cells is going into stage 1 clinicals. 

Food for thought:

1. Cancer research has been stunted by the big four pharma companies for the past 30 years.
2. Cancer is a multi trillion dollar business worldwide for these 4 companies.
3. Wall Street has over $1 trillion invested with the big four. (Johnson &amp; Johnson; Roche; Pfizer; Novartis)

810,threeleggedgirl,0.0,49.0,"Okay, for the record, I'm a novice investor and don't really fully know what I'm doing.

I looked at my portfolio and.... It's bad. I realized some gains and flipped some money around and kept myself only 7% in the red. But I've got some holdings seriously deep in the red! Especially my Arks and QCLN. 

Being new I'm sure you know where this goes, lol. ""Do I sell before I lose all my money??"" I calmed myself down and reminded myself I have high risk investments but they're mostly ETFs and are very unlikely to hit zero as they're being managed by people far smarter than me who are far greedier than me. 

So I decided to read the news, not for answers but to just see if I notice any trends and red flags. And everything is just talking about a ""tech sell-off"" and a ""growth sell-off"" (which, duh?). But the interesting thing to me is there's really no discernable pattern. All they really got is ""Oh well Ford announced this so Tesla slipped, oh growth is down because growth is down."" On Reddit I've heard about retirement accounts being rearranged, I've heard of big industries shorting to drive price down, I've heard people think a reopen will be this and that, I've heard it's a correction because those markets were in a bubble...

But I don't know. Something just feels like hysteria here. The fact boomer stocks are going up proportionately to tech going down has me suspicious. If tech is in a bubble and crashing because the price wasn't justified, what the hell's justifying the relatively large rise in banking and oil etc right now?? So are we just moving the ""bubble"" into a new industry?

I feel like this could just be that boomers overgauged the impact our pandemic has been having on society over the last few months. I really don't think $BOA was somehow less valuable just because we had to wear masks, just to give an example. What world does tech suddenly lose value just because we can go to Pink Floyd cover band concerts with our grandchildren again, too? Better switch back to the good ol' reliables because we're going to shut off our phones and hug each other in a few months?

When people realized they jumped the gun buying in on old money stocks, aren't they just going to buy back the same tech stocks they had before? What industry could they possibly hop to next? 

Even considering politics, this shit is weird and nonsensical! Why would tech advancements, green energy, etc hit an all time high during a regressive presidential administration and then become irrelevant? It's like people forget Biden will be president still after his 100 days and that he's just going to spend 4 years vaccinating us and nominating people. I'm not a fan of the guy but but green energy has been his headlining issue and I have a feeling as soon as ""Green New Deal"" is a headline again, my $QCLN will skyrocket before anything is even passed as people rush to buy back in to renewables. 

Just wanted to verbalize all of this to see if anyone else feels the same way - like this is some dumb sham being led by stubborn short sightedness and good old fashion boomer ludditism (and of course boosted by big dogs in the industry, no doubt). I feel like April will hit and we'll see another V shape tech recovery like we did during the pandemic's start because people realized they're too stuck on their old ways that are probably never fully returning.",stocks,Tech sell-off seems short-sighted?,49.0,0.82

“I think those in-the-know are generally hyper-bullish on telemedicine adoption over the next, idk, 7 years.

In my opinion the bear case is:

Short Term: -when are the q4 audited results and conference call? Why do we not have a date for that yet? Any problems? Auditor finding issues? Fear is high! -10 year bond yields rising... 38M revenue for 2020... even at $15/sh, that’s 10x trailing year revenue... steep price! Especially with bond yields rising, making “duration” (long time until profits) more painful, comparatively -Sure, we can throw out $90M expected revenue for 2021 all we want, but that’s 150% YoY growth. $HIMS has guided for 40% YoY growth (though they say that is conservative). $LFMD execution risk is real. Which makes investors even more anxious to hear that q4 call (and especially commentary)

Long Term: -It’s a high margin business (especially the DTC subscriptions of generics and soon skincare). High margins means competition (Hims, Roman, Keeps, Lemonaid, etc). Hims is no doubt the leader and the most recognizable brand... do they squash LFMD like a fly? -NavaMD shouldn’t be too capital intensive to launch, but it’s going to take some cash to get LifeMD up and running. How is the liquidity situation looking?

In the end, it’s risk vs reward. It’s a large part of my portfolio, though not the largest, and I’m in at an average cost of $18.90. I happen to think the risk/reward is very favorable if you’re a long term investor anywhere below $25/sh. The potential of LifeMD (powered by VeritasMD) is huge and disruptive. The growing DTC brands are nice little subscription businesses. ShapiroMD is solid, RexMD has huge growth potential, and I like the dermatology space a lot for telemedicine, so I’m bullish on NavaMD. They will eventually sell PDFSimpli to raise cash to support and grow LifeMD and be hyper focused on telemedicine.

It will be a bumpy ride. Just remember insiders found it wise to buy at $20-$21, they just raised $14M in a private placement at $23, the typically bearish Citron is bullish, and the two analysts covering it have price targets 60% above the current price. Management has a lot of experience in marketing and may have an edge in customer acquisition. The flywheel between the brands is strong, and cross-selling is possible. Hims launched in late 2017, and RexMD launched in Dec’19. If they’re worth half of what Hims currently is in 3 YEARS, it’s a 3x from here. If LifeMD is gains traction from employers one day, it’s 5x in 5-6 years. There’s always a chance at an $850M buyout in the near term for a 2x. Just a lot of ways to win.

829,TheFondestComb,0.0,3.0,"So I am currently looking to diversify into the industrial sector as I’ve noticed I don’t have any holdings in that sector and feel that with the Dems in charge there could be a infrastructure bill or just plain infrastructure kick backs and pork given to senators for working with the Dems. That being said the three tickers I’m currently looking at are NUE, STLD, and STAG. Below are the reasons why I’m looking at these companies and would love to hear from y’all if you have anything to add or if you have another industrial sector ticker I should look at. 

Starting out we have an OG industrial sector play that has been increasing its dividend every year for 48 consecutive years, is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE). This steel producer is the go to over other producers of steel like US steel (NYSE:X) because it doesn’t use old blast furnaces like we’re in the 1800’s. Instead it uses electrical arc furnaces which uses electricity to convert raw iron AND recycled scrap metal into useable steel. Something the blast furnaces can’t do because they require large amounts of raw material which isn’t always available when working with various scrap metals. Additionally this provides a much less volatile stock because even in times of less demand, electric arc furnaces are able to scale down their production and use less resources to save money overall so down trends don’t hurt them as much as blast furnaces.  This isn’t a fact that’s lost on the big name blast furnaces steel suppliers (X and CLF) who are both seeking ways to move into the electric arc furnace side one way or another, X is buying a smaller mill that has a single electric arc furnace and CLF is selling its iron byproducts and waste to NUE, who can recycle it and turn it into useable steel, to make up on losses from its blast furnace. Finally it pays a fair dividend with a dividend yield of 2.62% or roughly $1.60 per share per year paid out every quarter in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov.

Next up is STLD, which is basically what happened if someone said to you: “what if you wanted to invest in basically the exact same company as above, that has an almost identical dividend yield, was started by NUE employees, and has the room to grow into what NUE currently is?” I see this as a pure diversification in the steel industrial market by investing in Steel Dynamics (NYSE: STLD). The only reason I’m mentioning this company in addition to NUE is because of the diversification it offers along with the fact that it has room to move up 50% to catch up to NUE’s stock price. Additionally it’s actually increasing its dividend % for its next quarterly payout in April. For this stock, this year, you’re looking at a 2.36% dividend yield paying you about $1.04 per year per share. 

Finally there is Stag Industrial Inc NYSE:STAG). This REIT specializes in single tenant, industrial focused warehouses and properties for these major industrial producers. It also pays monthly which is great for that sweet sweet compounding action that we love to see when grabbing up  dividend plays and has increased its dividend the last 7 consecutive years. Additionally with it being a REIT, we as shareholders benefit from that law that says at least 90% of profits have to go to us. I view this as a sort of double diversification play, it allows me to invest in both real estate as well as the industrial sector.  

Any thoughts on these or any other industrials I should keep on my radar? I personally think I’ll be buying these three in my Roth IRA when my next check hits unless I find either a better industrial play, or a reason not to, such as me being completely wrong about one of these companies, which is possible since I’m not an expert or financial advisor and no one but me should take this as advice.",stocks,"Industrial Diversification with NUE, STLD, and STAG: DD",3.0,0.81

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? 

- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? 

- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

## Investing in Internet Forums

In my view, Pinterest can be one of the most sound social-networking investments.  Let’s keep one question in mind:

&gt; Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution.

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

- Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
- Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
- Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
- Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
- Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways. I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.


## Searching 

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally. 

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times: 

Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)
Skincare ideas (Target)
Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)
Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie, etc)

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. 
Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design. 

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy _outside_ of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.


## The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security &amp; Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify or Wordpress.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. Vectors for user’s channels like Etsy, Zoom, or TikTok.
6. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.



## Summary

I believe Pinterest qualifies as an excellent investment. I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.


I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.

Now my second problem is a bit deeper and hard for me to explain ; In the past few weeks, where the market has been pulling back, I've had some serious stress about how I can make more money in order to average down/get into new positions. I've been looking at stocks that, imo, are criminally undervalued and I just get anxious because I don't have enough money to put, I'm sitting on 140$ in my  savings and I'm waiting on friday for my next paycheck. I've been putting 80-90% of all my paychecks into stocks for the past 7-8 months. My next paycheck will be 0$ because I took vacation (planned it several months ago) on that period and I'm seriously getting worried about what to do to get money to invest, weird to say but it's like I have some OCD that pushes me to max the 6000$ and even when it's done I'm doing smaller trades in it.

If anyone has some advice/recommendations on what to do that would be great, I know this sound silly and yeah, first world problems I guess.

$RKT is the second most shorted stock right now and while it’s coming back to earth today, it had an amazing run yesterday (+78%) and is still up 15% from Monday’s close. The #1 shorted stock (55% of float) is $KMPH which had an 80% gain premarket and is currently sitting at 50%.

**What is $OTRK?**

$OTRK, Ontrak, Inc., operates as an artificial intelligence powered, virtualized outpatient healthcare treatment company that provides in-person or telehealth intervention services to health plans and other third-party payors.  Its Ontrak PRE (Predict-Recommend-Engage) platform predicts people whose chronic disease will improve with behavior change, recommends care pathways that people are willing to follow, and engages people who aren't getting the care they need.  The company's technology-enabled OnTrak program is designed to treat health plan members with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that cause or exacerbate chronic medical diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, COPD, and congestive heart failure.  The OnTrak integrates evidence-based psychosocial and medical interventions delivered in-person or via telehealth along with care coaching and in-market community care coordinators who address the social and environmental determinants of health. Ontrak is known for its proprietary methodology in understanding and engaging members who need treatment, as well as for quickly translating proven science into practice. The company was formerly known as Catasys, Inc. and changed its name to Ontrak, Inc. in July 2020.  The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California.

Telemedicine is obviously huge right now, and it’s great that they have an in-person option as well. The pandemic has also increased the need for mental health and substance abuse treatment and their AI system should help keep costs down and improve over time. And I love their mission of stopping diseases before they start, therefore reducing one’s lifetime medical costs. Unfortunately this mission is in contradiction with some health care providers’ goal of maximizing short term profits (more on this later). 

A similar company that you may have heard of is Livongo ($LVGO) which was just acquired Teladoc ($TDOC) at the end of last year. At the time, Livongo’s revenue was about 4x higher than Ontrak’s current revenue, and they had a lower EPS of -$0.26. And the deal valued Livomgo at $18.5 billion! Up to the merger, $TDOC and $LVGO were up 153% and 431% YTD, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** They are an in-person and telemedicine B2B provider that uses AI to address behavioral health and substance abuse in order to prevent other, more serious conditions. They have a very high growth potential and are a prime target for acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

Ontrak, Inc. is a small company. With a market cap of only $506M, they are unfortunately (fortunately?) too small for me to post about them on WallStreetBets. They have impressive financials, however, and have shown consistent improvement over the past 5 years. They just pre-released 2020 Q4 financials on March 1, and the full earnings report is scheduled for March 9.  EPS of -$0.07 beat expectations of -$0.30. Revenue for the full year of 2020 was $82.8 million, representing a 136% increase from 2019 and a CAGR of 120% since 2017. They have also continued to show considerable improvement in all valuation, profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. Their balance sheet is strong too, as they are sitting on $86.91M in cash. And here are the other highlights from their March 1 press release:

&amp;#x200B;

* Record Quarterly      Revenue of $29.3 million in Q4 2020, up 149% year over year and up 22%      from Q3 2020
* Operating loss of $1.8      million in Q4 2020, a 74% improvement year over year
* Record Quarterly      Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million in Q4 2020, achieving quarterly positive      Adjusted EBITDA for the first time
* Full Year Revenue of      $82.8 million, up 136% Year over Year
* 2021 Outlook revenue of      $100 Million
* Raised $44.9 million in      Q4 2020, $41.4 million net of related fees, by completing a second      offering of Non-Convertible Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock
* Acquired LifeDojo Inc.      in Q4 2020 ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201029005301/en/Ontrak-Acquires-Science-Backed-Behavior-Change-Platform-LifeDojo-Inc](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201029005301/en/Ontrak-Acquires-Science-Backed-Behavior-Change-Platform-LifeDojo-Inc))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why the drop?**

$OTRK is currently down around 74% from its 52-week high of $99.89 reached on January 27, was downgraded by a few analysts yesterday, and so far four law firms have announced that they are “investigating” the recent drop. This all seems to come from the typical playbook of the shorts, and I expect more negative news to come. There was a catalyst, however I believe the shorts are hiding behind this and using it to induce an overreaction. It also wouldn’t surprise me if some of the top holders are involved so they can make a quick profit and increase their long position. 

The catalyst was their announcement in their March 1 press release that they have lost their biggest customer, Aetna. From the release, Aetna is focused on “the lowest possible cost per medical visit, and not on clinical outcomes data or medical cost savings, which were meaningful and significant.” So as I mentioned earlier, this model conflicts with the goal of maximizing short term profits.  This is huge news, as Aetna provides 64% of their revenue, but the contract doesn’t expire until June 26 and the company is hoping to rebound quickly.  As the CEO mentions in the release, “We have a strategy in place to regain the Ontrak-A business and are *currently in late stage discussions with other customers* whose metrics align with our value proposition of an integrated approach to whole health that delivers an average ROI of 3.7, average cost savings of 40% to 50%, and durable clinical outcomes with exceptionally high program retention and member experience scores. Collectively, we have a *market opportunity of over $30 billion*.""

This news did cause Ontrak to adjust their estimated 2021 total revenue down to $100M from their previous estimate of $165M. This is a sizable decrease of 39%, however the stock is down almost twice that amount. $100M is also still an increase of 21% from 2020 revenue, and they project to return to 100% revenue growth in 2022. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** The company just lost their biggest customer, and revenue estimates have fallen significantly. The market has overreacted, however, indicating investors believe more customers may leave as well. Company guidance seems to indicate the opposite and projected financials are still strong. Trading at a huge discount IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Short**

As I said, Ontrak is a very small company. They are shorted 34% of float (4.76 short ratio), but that only represents 2.52M shares as their float is only at 7.2M. That’s lower than the total amount of WSB subscribers and only 3 shares per member of r/stocks! This could be a stock where our community actually does have some power. And while the shorts have succeeded in the past few days, there are currently only 250k shares available to borrow ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/OTRK](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/OTRK)). 

One company involved in the shorting is Culper Research, who used to often short companies in tandem with our favorite, Citron Research. They tried shorting $OTRK last year but failed miserably, and it looks like they are at it again ([https://twitter.com/CulperResearch/status/1366395871877877765](https://twitter.com/CulperResearch/status/1366395871877877765)). While there are some legitimate concerns, it’s hard to see any of them as a “death knell” as Culper puts it. Culper recently shorted (a stock that I can't mention here due to market cap) which drove the stock price down over 35%, however that company has responded with an investigation of their own (we’ll see if anything actual comes out of it). Sure, shorts play an important role in the market, but Culper seems to be one of those really nasty companies that tries to push companies to bankruptcy with baseless claims that their targets are completely “worthless.” I can’t find any evidence yet, but there are rumors that Culper actually lobbied Aetna to terminate their contract with OnTrak. There are also rumors that OnTrak is still in talks to retain Aetna (please share if you have any info on this!).     

Total shares outstanding is 17.54M. 28.3% of those shares are owned by institutions, the top holders being big names like ArrowMark, Credit Suisse, Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and our other favorite, Citadel. That number has grown significantly in the past few months as well (22.67%), and as we all know these guys don’t lose often. Even if the shorts cover their positions, and no squeeze is forced, these institutions should be increasing their positions now that it is trading at a discount to what they just recently paid. 

57.4% of shares are held by insiders and even with the recent rise, there have been no sales by insiders in over a year. The vast majority of insider shares, however, are all owned by the CEO, Terren S. Peizer (just under 9.2M shares). This amount of control is a little concerning, and I honestly can’t tell if Mr. Peizer is a genius or a scam artist (if anyone has more info on him I would love to hear it). On the other hand, it does give him a lot of incentive to maximize the share price and he has no reason to sell right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** Possible short squeeze, great long term outlook. High ownership by CEO and large institutions. Extremely low float means little volume needed to move the stock – could help with a squeeze, or be a trap, but just one subreddit or one whale could do a lot of damage here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My Position**

Shares continued to drop this morning and spent the day hovering between $26 and $28. It closed just over $26, and if it breaks downwards again tomorrow, my next target is around $20. Call volume is very bullish right now though and it looks extremely oversold. I really like the chances of a strong reversal here, so I opened a position of 140@26.95 today.

They buy more shit instead of investing. Business owners spend money directly in businesses to expand, build more stores, build more factories, more robots, etc. All that money has to come from somewhere. Usually it’s the stock market.

Think of Pepsi and Coke. If the price of Pepsi goes down, everyone is going to spend less money on Coke because Pepsi is now way cheaper. Right? That’s easy shit we all took the same dumb economics class in high school. Probably all got the same analogy too. 

But price isn’t the only variable, there’s also the return. Going back to the sodas, let’s say Pepsi and Coke cans stay the same price, but Pepsi doubles the size of their can. Now your return is twice as high for buying a can of Pepsi. So why would you buy Coke? Even if Coke was everyones favorite, some people are still gonna switch to Pepsi just because the Pepsi can is so much bigger. It feels like a better deal. 

Stocks and bonds are exactly like Pepsi and Coke. Bond rates going higher means a better return on bonds. So bonds are now twice the size and come with way more soda, whereas stocks are just as expensive as they were 3 months ago. That leaves a lot of stock drinkers rethinking their lives. Some of them will make the switch. It’s unavoidable.

I don’t want to scare anyone, that is not my intention in writing this post. Rather a warning to those who are less educated in what moves the market. I bet 90% of you reading this don’t even know what a government bond is (this was originally meant for WSB, I assume more than 10% of you know what Bonds are here lol). Buckle up, I’m about to blow your socks off with this publicly available information and maybe even help you not lose money, or even make some if you play it right! 

At this point I find it impossible to argue that we are not in a bubble. Let me explain why I think we are about to witness a market correction the likes of which we haven't seen since 1929.

The bond market is related to interest rates and inflation because the bonds issued by the U.S. treasury serve as a debt holding between the treasury and the fed.

A bond is basically an IOU of the government. They are debts. The treasury yield is the return you get for buying the government's debt.  

Feds control the money supply and interest rates by buying and selling bonds. To INCREASE money supply they will buy bonds back from the banks, which is the fed buying back their own debts. In turn, this gives the banks more money to put into circulation. The fed can REDUCE the money supply by selling the bonds. When this happens, it reduces money in circulation because the fed puts it in the ""safe"" so to speak. 

Rising treasury yield means lowering demand for bonds. Investors increasingly prefer high risk investments. (As seen with the disruptive growth sector exploding \[think Cathie Wood's ARK\]) 

That causes the demand for bonds to be low. When the demand is low, prices of bonds are at a discount, and the treasury yield goes up which gives an investor more incentive to buy in. 

BUT, if the demand for bonds is EXTREMELY low, how can the fed fight inflation? They can't decrease the money supply as discussed above because there's no buyers for their bonds!!! 

So instead, they print more money. 40% of all dollars in circulation were printed during the pandemic. Naturally, this makes the dollar lose value. 

The OTHER way to decrease inflation and money supply is through raising interest rates, which takes money out of circulation from the investors pockets, and back to the fed. 

HOWEVER, it is clear Jerome Powell doesn't want to raise interest rates (currently). They want borrowers to borrow more money. Banks won't do it though, as they have no incentive to do so (low interest rates are bad for banks because they make less money on their loans) 

So, they do it in the repo market. They lend money out to institutions and hedge funds, Which puts money in the stock market. This is what has been causing the massive bull run and the ""to the moon!"" or ""only go up"" sentiment of retail investors currently. 

My first big warning sign was the treasury yield hitting 1.5%. The next one would be the fed stopping repos. 

Interest rates low means everyone is naturally pumping money into the markets. 

This is because your Apple, Tesla, Google, Netflix etc have extremely high debt as compared to the biggest corporations of 50 years ago. And nowadays corporations can leverage their debt. 

So, if Company X is in 100 billion debt, they can refinance that debt from the loaner and invest the 100 billion.

so now instead of 100 billion debt it's 200 because they invested borrowed money. What happens when you invest borrowed money and the market crashes, except on a massive corporate scale? 

Debt is through the roof while investors are MANIC, no other time in history have investors been as manic now as in the 1920s. 

Think about it... roaring 20s: rich got richer poor got poorer 

But that’s just looking at it fundamentally

In the earlier graph, there was a flash crash followed by about a year of recovery before the bigger crash ensued. Now look at the 1990-2020. We just had our covid crash, a year later we're pumping to all time highs. Look familiar?

It was a 90% correction when it all came crashing down in the roaring twenties... 

And not to get political, but Democrats have had a tendency throughout history to act like everything is okay until the very last second. Think 2007 recession with the democratic senate and house. No one thought it was a bubble, everyone was saying everything's fine. 

On top of that, Michael burry recently tweeted (I believe it was since deleted, I can't seem to find it) something along the lines of ""Last time I warned you and nobody listened. This time I warn you again, and still no one listens. But this time I will have proof I warned."" Something big is about to go down.

867,VedVyas818,0.0,12.0,"I am seeing a lot of posts here talking about corrections and crashes so I just wanted to point out one thing that I believe is quite unique in the current market situation. For starters, my buddy started getting into the market a few months before the COVID crash in March. I believed that this was a bad idea because I thought that the market was due for a correction with the way that companies like $TSLA were running up the debt in expectations of future growth and revenue flow. The FED was beginning to [raise rates] (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) prior to the COVID crash, signaling, at least somewhat, the end of rampant speculative investing in the name of future growth. However, we all know what happened next. The coronavirus hit, and the FED decided to drop rates to the floor. They are now actively engaged in monetary policy and money management to a level that I don't think they have been inclined to do so prior. Furthermore, I think we can all acknowledge that Alan Greenspan and Bernanke to some extent were definitely asleep at the wheel, scared to do too much with monetary policy for the simple reason that they did not want to get into a liquidity trap and have no remedies to alleviate any crises on the horizon. At least, I give this much credit to Bernanke, but Greenspan was literally just incompetent or just hated regulating the banks and firms that much in my personal opinion.

The point of all this is that Jerome Powell and the rest of the FED, at this time, has such a heavy hand in the market compared to the FED pre-COVID, and *especially* pre-2013. They literally cannot afford to let any major market crash occur simply because they have a plan that they have to stick to in order to get America back on track in a major way. This is not to say that a major correction or crash CANNOT occur, but I do believe personally that the FED has more of an interest in not letting this go tits up than ever before. GDP growth in the U.S. has been at dismal levels for quite a while and inflation has been MIA. With the post-COVID economic recovery on the horizon, I believe that the FED sees extremely loose monetary policy as a way to kill these two birds with one stone.

Finally, what I think is somewhat proof of this. The fact that after the COVID crash, the market literally only went up. I am not saying 2020 market growth is sustainable forever or even if its here to stay, but merely using it as an example to show how powerful the FED is right now when it comes to manipulating and ensuring strong market conditions for institutional investors. I thought that rates so low was a recipe for disaster as the FED would have no real policy to mitigate against COVID ravaging the economy for the foreseeable future. However, I was forced to eat my words as to what the FED was doing and how the market was reacting (and my friend's positions) as, so far, a low interest rate policy *has worked and has shown no real signs of failure*. The FED has shown absolutely NO interest in raising rates for the next two years and any changes in the Treasuries are (in my opinion) not sufficient enough to spook them as they have such a heavy role in the current marketplace. To conclude, I am not a financial advisor, expert, or professional investor, so if you think my post is dumb, wrong, or skewed, please comment and let us have a discussion in order to further our knowledge, perspectives, and predictions of where the market is going :)

TL;DR: The FED is so heavily invested in ensuring low rates and economic recovery that it is very, very, very, very unlikely, in my personal opinion, that a major *marketwide* correction or crash will occur on Jerome Powell's watch.

871,seldomsage,0.0,73.0,"Hi team,

I had a lot of traction with my previous post on $ARKK so I thought I would lay out a very simple case as to why, in my view and others, we may experience more inflation in the coming years than the US has experienced in the last 50 years, and the potential implications of such a scenario.

**********************

The math is simple and it relies on two basic concepts from Macroeconomics 101:

1. M2 Money Supply - this is an estimate published by the Federal Reserve that approximates dollars in circulation (and things like savings accounts, money market funds, and other sources that are liquid and can behave like cash)

2. M2 Velocity of Money - Also published by the Fed, this seeks to estimate the number of times that each dollar in M2 exchanges hands over the course of the year (turnover)

The equation linking these two concepts to Gross Domestic Product is quite simple as well.

M2 Money Supply x M2 Velocity = Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP)

**********************

What we saw throughout 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policies that followed, was a substantial increase in money supply (stimulus) and a substantial decrease in the velocity of money (stay-at-home orders). Based on our simple equation, these factors mostly offset each other and therefore were not visibly inflationary.

1. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 money supply increased from $15.1 trillion to $19.4 trillion (+28%) Note: Fastest growth rate since WWII

2. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 velocity declined from 1.4 to 1.1 (-21%)

Plugging into our equation:

Year-end 2019: 1.4 x $15.1T = $21.14T annualized nominal GDP

Year-end 2020: 1.1 x $19.4T = $21.34T annualized nominal GDP

This represents a change in NGDP of just 1%! No inflation!

**********************

What happens next? Some of you have already gotten vaccines, others have already been sick and developed immunity. States have recently announced reopening completely, and national case counts are showing relatively steep declines as we approach vaccination and illness-induced herd immunity.

What does this mean? Consumer spending habits are changing. Record high savings rates and savings balances are likely to revert to normal. We'll take vacations, go to concerts, eat out at restaurants, etc - all things we haven't been able to do for the last 12 months.

This means a recovery in M2 velocity but with a new much higher base of money.

**********************

Let's look back at our equation and make a few assumptions about the recovery of velocity.

***Scenario 1: Velocity recovers to pre-COVID level at end of 2019***

1.4 x $19.4T = $27.16T NGDP (+27% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 2: Velocity recovers and overshoots the pre-COVID level, say to the trailing 10-year average velocity of 1.5***

1.5 x $19.4T =$29.1T NGDP (+36% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 3: Inflation becomes widely recognized and consumers/investors look for alternatives to holding cash, velocity spikes to the highest it has been in 10 years at 1.75 and inflation feeds on itself***

1.75 x $19.4T = $33.95T NGDP (+59% compared with year-end 2020)

**********************

It is likely that this inflation will be spread out over more than a year, but the key question at hand is:

*""How long will it take for the price level to reflect all of this new money in the system and how long will it take for velocity to fully recover (or overshoot)?""*

In each scenario, even if it took 2-3 years we are talking about ***double digit annualized inflation rates...*** 

*AND THAT IS BEFORE WE SEE THE IMPACT ON MONEY SUPPLY AND VELOCITY FROM YET MORE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS.*

Inflation rates may be *much higher* than the figures outlined above... and despite all of this the Federal Reserve continues to say that they see no inflation, that they are content to keep short-term interest rates at zero until 2023 or later. Asleep at the wheel if you ask me.

**********************

What does it mean for r/stocks and your investment portfolio? In a nutshell:

1. Nominal interest rates are likely to rise, commodity prices (oil) will increase, real estate values will increase (REITs), the prices of all *real assets* will increase.

2. Companies that are able to index their revenues to inflation (pricing power!) will be able to defend their earnings, while others will see input costs skyrocket and revenues fail to keep up.

3. The equity markets are going to be volatile, with winners and losers. Companies that are highly leveraged and don't have pricing power may go bankrupt when they need to refinance debts at higher rates.

4. Other companies with pricing power, low variable costs, or durable intellectual property will be huge winners.

5. Tech/growth stocks that trade at obscenely rich valuation and who promise real profits years or decades into the future are going to get smashed. These so called ""long-duration"" equities, many of which are favorites on r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets, even if they survive, may go from trading at 25-50x trailing revenues (on zero net income) to 5-10x revenue or less - examples: SHOP trades at 50x trailing revenues and 470x trailing earnings, ROKU trades at 27x trailing revenue on *negative earnings*. 

6. In relation to point 5, inflation-driven equity volatility is likely to result in *higher equity risk premiums*, or higher discount rates on forecasted growth. 

7. Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.

8. Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation (American middle class) will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash. There's a whole other discussion about income and wealth inequality in here but we'll leave that for another day.

Let's first start off with a quick recap of what happened the past few days

1. On February 23rd, I requested a deposit of $1,000 into my RobinHood account. I didn't get an instant deposit of $1,000 right away. The $1,000 was deposited at pre-market the next day (February 24th), and I got a notification saying that the deposit is ""complete"" and that I am ""now using $1,000"" of my instant deposit limit.. This is great news. I'm glad that deposit was loaded into my buying power.
2. On February 24th, towards 3 PM EST, I requested a deposit of $1,000 again into my RobinHood account. Again, I didn't get an instant deposit of $1,000 right after. So I figured that it would be like the previous case and just get added to my account at pre-market. The next day comes by, and I get a notification saying that the deposit is ""complete"" and that I am ""now using $0.00"" of my instant deposit limit. I checked my buying power the next and quickly found that the $1,000 wasn't added into my buying power.
3. Keep in mind that on both of these days, I sold off some big positions to buy back into other positions that were tanking hard. So any purchases here were not with the $1,000 deposit because I never got that. They were instead funded through the cash returned from selling other equities.
4. I reached out to the support team here, and from what I understood from the representative, it seems like the instant deposit of the second transaction was used to fill in the price of the first transaction instead of that first transaction waiting for 5 days. So with that assumption, I figured that now I had to wait 5 days for this transaction to go through and then I'd see the $1,000 come in.
5. Till now, nothing has been added into my buying power, and it's been 5 business days since I've requested it. I did notice something strange over the weekend that on late Sunday midnight-ish (EST time), my portfolio said that I was up $700 on the daily chart, which I have no clue how that was. I first thought it was a glitch, but it persisted throughout the day, and at this point, I have no clue if it's accurate or not. I also thought that it might've been the $1,000 getting dumped into my equities, but I totally doubt that since it was over the weekend and I don't think I've even set up recurring investments.

So here I am going back and forth with the RH support team, and here's what I've collected:

1. It takes up to 5 days for the transaction to be added into buying power
2. Even if the bank fully processes the transaction, it may still be delayed in showing in my RH buying power up to the 5 day mark.
3. If there's any pending deposits, those get filled using the instant deposit of subsequent transfers
   1. i.e. the first deposit was technically pending even though they gave me the $1000 before 5 days, and so the second deposit's initial deposit limit was used to cover the previous pending deposit (at least, that's what I understood from what was said)

But the thing that pisses me off is the fact that they can't give me a freakin estimate as to when my money will be in my buying power. Every freakin day I wake up early as heck hoping that my money is in my account, but then I see a fat zero. And it only hurts more when I see a bleeding market that I can at least average down on a bit (lol 1k won't do much, but invested money is invested money). I'm guessing I'll probably get it tomorrow morning and I just hope the market is still red so I don't miss out on this dip, but meh, it feels horrible to have waited this long for a freakin 1k deposit. Seriously thinking of transferring to another brokerage. Apologies for the long rant, just needed to dump my frustration with RH the past week. 

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on good brokerages to transfer to? Also, is it worth transferring now during a market correction (Not sure how long it would take to transfer and whether the duration of the transfer would make me miss more of this buying dip)? In terms of brokerage platforms, I'm looking for the following features mainly

1. Ability to trade within full extended hours, not just between 900 AM - 600 PM EST like RH allows.
2. Ability to transfer money instantly, even if in big lumps. I don't want to be waiting for a transfer of just $1,000 for 5 days. That's freakin ridiculous to say the least.
3. Simple-to-use UI that's similar to RH or better.

\- NEM beats KGC by 5 in ESG risk rating

**Company/Stock:**

\- Kinross Gold's debt to equity ratio is significantly higher than the metal mining industry's average debt to equity ratio. This could be explained by the sharp increase in production (linked to gold prices appreciating) and choosing to take on debt to finance operations \[15\]\[17\]\[20\].

\- Kinross Gold's share price has dropped 29.5% in the last 6 months \[5\].

\- Kinross Gold performs very poorly among its competitors for its carbon footprint \[21\].

\- Kinross Gold performs poorly among its competitors for its water conservation \[21\].

\- Share price is below 20 and 200 MA (bearish signal for some, bullish for others).

**Market:**

\- Gold price decreased by 10% in the past 6 months and 5% in the past 30 days \[20\].

\- In 2020, global gold production fell by 5.2%. In 2019, global gold production fell by 1% (first time since 2008) \[24\].

\- *""Based on known reserves, estimates suggest that gold mining could reach the point of being economically unsustainable by 2050, though new vein discoveries will likely push that date back somewhat."" ""...It is unlikely that large-scale gold mining will continue past 2075 without either huge mining technology advances or the discovery of currently unknown massive gold deposits""* \[22\].

\- *""Gold mining can significantly alter the natural environment. For example, gold mining activities in tropical forests are increasingly causing deforestation along rivers and in remote areas rich in biodiversity.""*  \[23\].

## Bullish Arguments

**Head to Head:**

\- KGC beats NEM by 62.4% in 12 month price change.

**Company/Stock:**

\- Kinross Gold's projected revenue of $4.6B for 2021 is 2.4x higher than current total debt of $4.2B and has the potential to decrease the company's debt to equity ratio, moving it closer to the industry's average \[13\]\[15\].

\- Kinross Gold has seen significant gains in net income in the past 3 years, growing by 5788.14% \[11\].

\- Kinross Gold's share price has grown 56.6% in the last 12 months \[5\].

\- Kinross Gold's stock has a low short % of shares (1.19%) outstanding with a high % of shares held by institutional investors (67.4%) \[3\].

\- Kinross Gold announced in September 2020 that the dividend would be reinstated. Management has displayed confidence in the near- to mid-term by restarted dividend payments. Based on current production projections, the payments are expected to continue until 2023 \[25\].

\- Kinross Gold's updates on development projects, exploration and mineral reserves, and resources show successful signs of progress with no delays. The company reported extensions of mine life at several sites as well as an expansion of mineral reserves \[27\]. 

\- Kinross Gold has an EPS growth of 44%, compound, over the last three years \[28\].

\- Kinross Gold is JP Morgan's ‘top pick in the gold sector,’ rated as Overweight (i.e., a Buy) \[29\]. 

\- Kinross Gold has beaten analysts earning estimates the last 4 quarters \[30\].

\- Kinross Gold performs well among its competitors for its employee satisfaction and pay and corporate governance \[21\].

\- Kinross Gold has shared new plans and renewed commitment to decrease carbon footprint and water conservation \[31\]\[32\] 

**Market:**

\- Investing in a growing gold company can act as leverage to the price of gold. When gold appreciates, gold mining companies can increase their production and grow revenues. The price of gold has increased substantially by 561% over the past 20 years, 36% in the past 5 years, and 5.8% in the last 12 months. This has provided smaller mining companies like Kinross with the leverage they need to grow their sales \[11\]\[20\].

\- There's a general weak US dollar outlook, especially once COVID worries subside. Gold is a good hedge against inflation when the value of the dollar falls \[33\].

\- 7.5% of worldwide demand for gold comes from the consumer technology industry. As the industry grows, demand for gold will grow with it, driving up the price. Consumer technology is projected to generate $2.06 trillion in 2023, compared to $1.69 trillion in 2019 \[34\]\[35\].

\- Gold is widely regarded as a good hedge against economic turbulence and uncertainty, and is therefore considered a recession-proof investment.

\- Global gold production is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021 \[36\].

This leveraged ETF would have pretty big daily swings of potentially 100 pts in a day, sometimes even more.  The price drove up from the $100s in early 2020 to about $636 just before the  15/1 split the other day.  

If trading activity was such that price swings would move by over 100 points in a day, why is it post split, those swings seem to also get equally reduced? Isn't the same level of volume and money still transferring back and forth even if the per share was reduced by a 15 multiplier? 

I'm just curious from a technical perspective how this type of thing works.

Stocks fell for the second straight day, with technology stocks dropping sharply as the Treasury yield ticked higher once again. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.7%, the second consecutive decline for the tech-heavy index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better, edging down 0.4%.

President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate. As a reminder, over the weekend, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single dose vaccine received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the third coronavirus vaccine available in the US, following Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced it was going to help Johnson &amp; Johnson produce its coronavirus vaccine. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with a simple majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate—plus a Democratic vice president—reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president’s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it

The likelihood of more stimulus and widespread business reopenings as the vaccine is distributewd has raised the specter of both speedy growth in the U.S. economy and rising inflationary pressures. Last week's jump in Treasury yields – with the benchmark 10-year yield reaching a one-year high of 1.61% – remains fresh in the minds of investors, who have been eyeing the rise in interest rates as a possible hindrance to the recovery and deviation from last year's ultra-low borrowing costs backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield currently sits at 1.48% at the time of writing.

883,SnooMacarons1548,0.0,346.0,"First off, let's go straight to the point. The last few weeks have been a bloodbath for most of the market. To many, especially new traders, this seems like a full blown market crash. Well, it's not... a market crash needs a catalyst. Think back to every single crash, whether it was the dot com bubble, the housing bubble in 08, and even the flash crash on black Monday in 87' they all had a catalyst, if not many catalysts.

I keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.

 Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is ""the economy is overheating"". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet. I can also note that the same journalists who publish this FUD about overheating, are the same journalists who will also write that the market is crashing when there is BAD economic data (such as the job report this morning). So let's ask ourselves, how can both a booming recovery and a slow, painful recovery BOTH be ingredients for a crash? I cannot comprehend how ridiculous this is becoming. Good news = market crash, bad news = market crash. What do we need for the market not to crash? 

I can't talk about all of this without mentioning a wild phenomenon. My portfolio. A very well diversified array of etfs which hit almost all sectors of the market. The best thing to happen to it? A global pandemic/ lockdown. The worst thing? Economic strength indicators, covid cases plummeting and vaccines and stimulus getting pumped into the masses. Has the world gone mad?

My conclusion is only this. Plain and simple, fear. Fear is what's bringing this bloodbath upon us. Panic selling over irrational news articles. Just compare the VIX (fear gauge) chart with almost every single tech stock or major company's stock chart. It's literally an inverse. A mirror image.

If there is anything to take away from this is that I truly believe this is just mass hysteria and it the dust will settle. Stocks will rise again. Invest in what you believe in and avoid the FUD that's being pumped out for click bait by seemingly every news outlet.

Tl;dr: there is no crash. This is panic selling on a mass scale. Don't believe the media fud - the pandemic is ending and there is light at the end of this Corona virus tunnel. Buy the dip with money you can afford to potentially lose and all shall be good again on wallstreet. *Edit* I am not an expert, do not take this as financial advice. I was merely venting/ ranting during this paragraph. Only invest what you are willing to lose. 

Edit: I almost forgot to mention a big one: 

Another theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane. Comoanjes blew estimates out of the water left and right. Banks, big tech, e commerce, etc. These are the sectors that are being targeted heavily by fud in the media. These are also the companies doing the best they ever have. So how is this a bubble? Of course, companies like tesla and gamestop (lol) can be viewed and argued as in a bubble. But these companies are few and far between.

Edit#2 as someone here pointed out, the current p/e ratio is at around 40 for the s&amp;p500. Is this really a cause for concern? The all time high for p/e of the s&amp;p is may 2009.

2. Can show my portfolio (I can't believe I have to list it as a feature).
3. Good charts, with many of the latest and greatest indicators, which I had to program in ToS.
4. Stock scanner which responds in reasonable time (sub 10 seconds).
5. Ability to program in stock scanner, like create my own weighted formulas.
6. **Option** scanner like the above, can scan on options specific data like days to expiration, extrinsic, open interest, etc, combined with the stock data that the option is written on (P/E, market cap, etc).
7. Ability to create an option strategy and view the graphs in multiple timelines (not just expiration)
8. Good fills on orders
9. Seamless after hours trading, IE place GTC+EXT orders, not reenter EXT orders again and again every day.
10. See bids and asks of an equity (called active trader in ToS)
11. Research fundamentals of a company (P/E, P/S, short ratio, etc). Believe it or not P/S ratio is something you have to write code in ToS.
12. Alerts (like price crosses below ema) in a simple to understand way.
13. A programing language, ideally an existing language like JS or Java and not a proprietary language.
14. Organize my stocks/options in groups.
15. Supports special acquisition corp units, warrants and splits.

1. Legit news feed
2. Conditional orders after hours (I haven't heard of any platform that does that yet, give me some good news).

I'm new to investing so my DD isn't worth much, but this amount of recovery (~30% since I started in late Jan/early Feb) is a bit higher than I'd expected at this point.

That introduces some potential volatility, right? It seems to me there is a high possibility that airlines will be overvalued soon as the pandemic ends.

It’s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. 

- Ask yourself what you’ve learned about your risk tolerance. 

- Ask yourself what lessons you’ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. 

When the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don’t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y’all. Y’all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y’all don’t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. 

About a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai 

https://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/

I think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y’all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y’all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn’t normal. 

It’s easy to say “buy and hold forever!!!” And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it’s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. 

It’s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn’t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can’t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won’t make money. 

Personal way of dealing with this: 

When it comes to volatility, I’ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It’s hard but I’ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I’m buying and know why I am buying it.

908,neomancr,0.0,10.0,"I think we should really analyze LIDAR for what it is and what FRSX is doing and how the perception of cameras versus lasers are gas lighting the whole concept.

I think after some analysis we'll find that the only realistic autonomous navigation solution would have to rely on optics. LIDAR seems futuristic because lasers seem Sci fi, but optical sensors are actually much more modern and capable than lasers, and certainly much more capable than ""cameras."" LIDAR on the other hand has always been a dead end relying only on the hype that lasers seem more futuristic than what we call cameras which is as appropriate as calling our pocket cyber coms ""phones"" when they're rarely used for actual calls. 

To start with anything that relies on radiation relies on reflection. This presents an immediately problem where the path of send and return to sender has to make a round trip and will inevitably suffer loss even without any interference issues but in practice there is always noise and the unreliability of how we expect the world to reflect lasers. Even before, we have atmospheric noise, whether the air is hot and dry or wet and cold. We have multipath ghosting/distortion lloyds mirror issues, etc Laser propagation even if it were modulated to a certain  frequency would only increase the likelihood of errors due to the frequencies now having to be filtered which means more latency but also the concept of ""dropping a signal"" until it locks back on. Frequency modulation is inherently more noisy and more subject to comb filtering between its own lasers and when any other vehicle is near and also using lidar.

Interference, scatter, diffusion proportional to the distance times 2 since the dispersion has to return to sender AFTER reflecting off the myriad surfaces it relies on only gets worse with more range, and compounded by the idea that multiple vehicles are expected to ignore all other radiation sources including other vehicles also contributing to the same problem would be such a mess and the more it might be attempted the more difficult it would be to make it reliable. And then we have multipath interference, ghosting etc issues where before returning to sender a reflection might not make it back, or might bounce twice as you have anytime you shine a laser into a hollow cube. 



We don't see by spraying light out of our eyes, real life as it is already radiates energy well enough optical sensors can be used for night vision and thermal vision. 

FRSX just proved its tech with a full day test and it really just made it more obvious to me how much of a dead end lidar really is. 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/frsx-stock-why-foresight-autonomous-rallied-30-25-today/ar-BB1e86b4

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/skip-foresight-autonomous-holdings-until-the-price-comes-down-or-it-proves-its-technology/ar-BB1dhAD0

They use 3D cameras and thermal to see in the dark. They rely on what our eyes rely on and more--radiation that already emanates from objects. It isn't based on any need for round trip signal dispersion and so has no issues with interference, doesn't require lighting due to the thermal optical sensors, has long range depth perception that lasers are not capable of, and can sense soft non reflective objects. With its 3D/thermal sensor array with augmented AI it can also detect moving objects versus stationary objects, and can ""see"" through any weather condition. 


The question had always been, can it really pull off an accurate test run to prove that it works? And the answer is a very apparent yes. They have already been scouted by an unnamed large player in the auto industry.


Their tech is patented in the US and China. They also use 5g to further augment their technology which is also patented. 

Tldr: summary:

The reference to modern day optical sensors as ""cameras"" under estimate what we really have, while lasers have Sci fi hype they are actually a dead end technology when it comes to autonomous surveillance. Even in our own imagined future in fiction we don't expect things to see like cyclops from xmen.

LIDAR is also very susceptible to hacking since you could simply block the return mean and feed the sensors your own effectively turning the car into a giant RC toy. 

Corrected: TV Typo changed to RC

What they really have and if you get past the idea that they're cameras and see what the optical array is, it's applications as of now are still being way under estimated. There is no reason why this tech would be limited to cars 



This wouldn't only be useful for AVs, large delivery drones, indoor robots, sectors like the military, hospitals, warehouses, anything can apply this tech. Governments can use this to analyze traffic patterns to optimize roads and street lights. 


There is a dip right now and the price target as of a month ago was 13 dollars but that was before the crucible it just completed with flying colors.



You know where else lidar and sonar would have issues? Beyond the ionosphere in outer space where all the ambient radiation might as well be pitch darkness or white noise in terms of relying on beaming and reflection. 



Even if we get past the idea that lasers are somehow more advanced than ""cameras"" and better understand the potential of optical sensors, it's still a technology that is extremely under estimated since most people are just thinking of cars.



A major factor that isn't covered is that obviously if you wanted to have an autonomous stealth drone, you wouldn't want it spraying lasers or radar everywhere unless that's how it kills things. 


Our subconscious minds already expect optical sensors to be how autonomous machines ""see"". Optical including thermal sensors are actually a lot more modern and futuristic than lasers or digital cameras. If a robot saw by spinning lasers around it would look dated and like a bad guess of how the future would look.  Think of the potential for a drone that can see your house from 500 feet above, then check of anyone is around, and when the coast is clear drop off packages right on your door step.

So I started to do my own DD. First thing I noticed was that many of these companies stock have grown over 100% in the past year. I went on to read articles about freight and bounced questions off my buddy. Long story short, I felt comfortable enough to invest a large portion of my portfolio (\~25k in stock and 5k in calls) on a single company. I'm not going to name any freight company here cause some of their market caps are relatively low and the volume is relatively low for many of these companies.

So far I'm already up 35% just in the past two weeks. I'd encourage y'all to go take a look for yourself, do your own DD and get in on the action while it is hot. I'll also post any follow up DD that I come across in the following weeks.",stocks,Freight &amp; Logistics DD,2.0,1.0

961,spacecowboy8008,0.0,1.0," Asian Restaurant Supply Company - HF Foods Group - HFFG

Alright this is my first DD ever, so rip into it the best you can and tell me where I can improve.

Company description

HF Foods Group is the largest Asian restaurant supplier in the United States. They focus on dry and frozen goods. From their website ([https://hffoodsgroup.com/](https://hffoodsgroup.com/)) they supply sauces, noodles, meat, seafood, fresh produce, commodities, packaging, and more. From what I can gather, this is where your local neighborhood Chinese restaurant gets all their operating supplies from. I think of them as the Sysco of the asian food market. They operate out of 14 different distribution centers focused in the west and southeast of the United States.

History

It looks like they went public in 2017. Since then, two big events have happened.

They merged with B&amp;R in June of 2019. I can’t find anything about this except that the CEO of B&amp;R became the co-CEO of HFFG.

They were investigated for misleading shareholders by multiple attorneys between July of 2019 and May of 2020. From what I can find, the SEC has not gotten involved with this. The claim is that they spent money on things like sports cars and stuff like that. I’m pretty new to investing, so I’m not sure how common attorney investigations are or how much of a red flag they are.

Competition

It's hard to find direct competitors who do exactly what they do on a national scale.

CTC Food international is an Asian supply company that looks to focus on grocery stores.

Sysco also has an Asian food supply branch, but from what I can find, it doesn't look like they are the ones supplying your strip mall Chinese restaurant. If anyone knows somewhere else Asian restaurants are getting their supplies please let me know. Has anyone here working in a Chinese restaurant and know more about suppliers?

Ownership/Leadership

Xiao Mou Zhang aka Peter Zhang - CEO/Director

Peter was the CEO of B &amp; R Global Holdings before they merged. He was recently promoted from co-CEO to CEO after the voluntary resignation of Zhou Min Ni (who was the other co-CEO. This all happened around 2/25/21. He’s been in the business for 20 years, but beyond that, it’s hard to find any additional info on him. But as Oscar once said

“Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that every organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?”

Russell T. Libby - Chairman of the Board

This guy was a Sysco vet of 12 years. Straight from Business Insider

“Russell Libby has nearly 30 years of experience in mergers and acquisitions, strategy, business development, international business, corporate governance, and corporate social responsibility. From 2007 to 2019, he held numerous leadership positions at Sysco Corp. and most recently served as the company’s executive vice president and corporate secretary.”

He was appointed to the board in March of 2020. February 25th, 2021 he was appointed the Chairman of the Board, unanimously, taking effect immediately.

Dr. Hong Wang - Independent Director

This guy is a lifelong professor of business. Not much to say other than that.

Asian community

I have a friend who is a realtor. She says it is common practice for Chinese customers to go with a Chinese realtor. It's extremely rare for a Chinese customer to go with a non-Chinese realtor. Now, this is just a broad generalization, but I do think this carries over into the food market. I think these Asian restaurants are going to be more likely to buy from Asian owned companies. And HFFG is an Asian managed company.

Industry

Asian restaurant industry looked to be $15.4billion in 2020, with 1% growth per year over the last 5 years. No reason to think that the industry should not hold steady going forward.

Covid

Covid crushed the Asian food industry. Remember when Trump was calling it the Chinavirus? From their chart, we can see they took a huge hit around that time last year. They have not rebounded at all. But if we look at sysco, we see their rebound is complete.

Financials

Market cap of $386.39M

Price/Book is 1.12 - Sysco is 27.53

Revenue % change (TTM) +95%

Revenue Growth (last 5 years) +5.93%

Compared to sysco, which is a terrible comparison, this stock is cheap. Revenue is growing steady.

Gross Margin (most recent Quarter) 21.08%

Gross Margin (TTM) 20%

Operating Margin (most recent Quarter) .88%

Operating Margin (TTM) .46%

So the last quarter had slightly better margin then the trailing twelve months (TTM)

Total Debt/Equity (TTM) 39%

They don’t have a terrible amount of debt.

And their balance sheet -

The last four quarters on the balance sheet have looked healthy. Their current assets cover their current liabilities. Their liabilities have been holding steady since covid hit. This shows me they were able to find capital in the short term to cover any debt. They don’t look at risk of becoming insolvent any time soon.

Follow up questions

Has anyone here worked in a Chinese restaurant and know more about suppliers?

How big of a red flag are those investigations by the attorneys?

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday’s early gain fizzles and reverses

&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday’s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.

&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street’s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government’s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.

*****

&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill

&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.

*****

&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for ‘every adult’ by end of May

&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate “every adult in America” by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.

&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they’re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.

*****

&gt; # 4. America’s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for ‘Dreamers’

&gt; * America’s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations — including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber — asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.

*****

&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health

&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.

&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.

&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.

I bought ENPH and NIO near their ATH's in January. Both are down significantly since then, and I'm bagholding about 20-30% losses on both.

I'm looking for some advice on what are some good ways to proceed.

One strategy I have is just to not look at my portfolio and hold for a year and see where it goes. Parts of me thinks that may be the best strategy, but its also incredible passive and if I wanted to do that I should have just bought QCLN and ICLN instead of NIO and ENPH respectively.

Another strategy is to sell covered calls (i have at least 100 shares in each) to recoup my costs in both. Since they're down about 25% on average, it feels like ""picking up pennies in front of a steam roller"", but a part of me feels like this is good penance for my recklessness. It'll teach me better for my next move.

The last strategy is just to cut my losses and move the money over to something that can recover that 25% faster than NIO and ENPH.

There is a fourth strategy, which is to free up cash and average down so my cost average isn't so high. I'm not a fan of this strategy as it'll make my portfolio overweight in two stocks that already are emotional plays.

Just looking for some ""community wisdom"" on strategies here to mitigate my risk and leverage assets that I currently have.

977,michanik,0.0,70.0," Since the crash of 2020, many sectors have recovered and are trading at pre-pandemic levels (looking at you Tech). Defense and Aerospace is one of the few sectors that are still trading at a massive discount. Big names such as Raytheon Technologies (RTX), General Electric (GE), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) can be grabbed at a discount.

My favorite being Lockheed Martin.

Lockheed Martin has had a phenomenal decade with revenues and profits growing about an average of 9.5% YoY. its profit and operating margins are sitting at a healthy 10 and 13% respectively. With deep ties to the US government and a steady increase in military budgets (who represent 70% of sales) as well as any hint of potential conflicts directly benefit the company.  
Its F35 program has had some issues and production delays due to covid but is looking like it is taking off. This will guarantee a further revenue stream for the next decade at least. Its missiles and fire control segment grew a whopping 51% since 2017 with its other sector such as Aeronautics and space segment at about 23% each. Furthermore, LMT is the prime contractor for NASA's Orion Spacecraft and is working actively with them on long-duration human deep space exploration.  
LMT pays a solid dividend of about 3.1% at current prices that has been increasing steadily over the years and is likely to continue.

Other options to capture the sector exist such as the DFEN ETF (though should be warned it is leverage, hence the very strong price drop) or the more general ITA ETF.

Disclaimer. I own all 3 of the stocks mentioned. Picked up GE and Raytheon in December and recently took up Lockheed. They seem like great value and have provided steady returns and are one of the few sectors left that are still trading at undervalued prices. I believe the weak sectors are bound for a rebound due to the great rate of vaccine uptake that will subsequently lead to a new economic cycle starting. Companies that have a solid business as is in this case will profit even more.

Thank you for reading.

My other top picks include Exxon and BP (Oil and Gas, though they are no longer trading at the same discount but still have some room for growth with essential business and good dividends), Wells Fargo and JP Morgan (Banks and financial services), Kelloggs (undervalued consumer staples, which will benefit from a strong economic recovery) and Simon Property Group and WP Carey (solid dividend-paying REITs which are also undervalued).",stocks,Defense and Aerospace stocks are undervalued and are a good opportunity for investment,70.0,0.9
978,shootermgavin_crypto,0.0,128.0," Hi all,

I was inspired by the choppy market action to do a write up on losing control when you trade. It's extracted from my blog (no self promote, no links or sneaky sheet), maybe it resonates with you:

It's about losing and regaining control on the holy grail of trading YOUR trading plan:

What Happens When we Lose Control.

I posted this in Daytrading but the exact same applies for investors or long term traders.

Many destructive emotions or situations stir up feelings associated with loss of control. **Some examples of what's happened to me in the past:**

*You buy a stock, it goes down, you sell it to avoid losing money and it literally goes back up the next second, so you jump back in and it goes down again!*

Essentially, you are trying to control whether or not you make money. The obvious problem here - **you don't control price.**

This is probably one of the most common root causes of over-trading. And comes down to a few things:

1. You do not have a trading plan that you understand
2. Emotions are acted on instantly
3. Fear is in the passenger seat and you are trying to gain control of your emotions
4. Your current system doesn't suit your personality

Trading is so full of paradoxes it would make you sick to your stomach, in fact, it does make some people literally sick to their stomach. The very need for control and our primitive brain  is basically wired to stop us from making money. Admitting we don't know where a stock will go is the first step to recovery, and a long road it is.

**Example 2 (Based on the above):**

*Holding onto losses in order to avoid the pain of ""loss"". There are many terms for this, for more info you can look into the disposition effect. Here we have the metamorphosis of a ""trader"", someone who always tells you when they are winning to an ""investor"", someone who holds shit stocks while they tank.*

Again, this ties into control (and ego) which quite frankly are like peas in a pod and feed from one another.

By trying to control the outcome of a trade, we find all sorts of ways to really fuck up our trading strategy in all sorts of creative ways. The very things we try to avoid, which in ""normal life can be easy"", in the stock market, are impossible. If your wife/husband asks you if you look fat, you can tell a white lie. If a stock goes down and you own it, no lie will bail you out.

The stock market doesn't give a shit about how much money we make or lose, it's totally objective. Therefore, saying it's ""rigged"" or ""manipulated"" is totally irrelevant because it is rigged for all of us with few exceptions.

What we Can't Control

The reality of trading in terms of control is simple. It's much better to avoid things we can't control as the energy expended in this way removes focus from what we can control.

Very easy to say but the long term impact will be successful trading or mediocre trading. As it turns out, we can't actually control the entire world - who would have thought! Some examples:

1. If a stock goes up or down
2. Black Swan events #Rona-19, 2008
3. How much the central bank prints or doesn't print
4. How governments will react to certain situations
5. Anything to do with the news
6. If country A decides to bomb country B
7. People (long term)
8. Interest rates

Ironically, the things outside of our control are what freak us out of positions, push us into making rash buying or selling decisions and trigger our fight or flight reactions and derail any half-decent trading plan.

I will openly admit I spend too much time on what I can't control. When it comes to people, stressful situations and even macro-economics. It is very hard to drown out the inputs from social media, friends, family and others. Even worse still is to avoid holding strong opinions on all of the

**So What Can we Control**

All is not lost though. If we could not control any variables in our stock market endeavors it would be pretty damn pointless to trade. The ingredients for success are truly found in the decisions we make in relation to:

1. When we buy a stock
2. When we sell a stock
3. What strategy we decide upon
4. Our environment
5. How much of whatever we buy or sell
6. The types of things we decide to watch, listen to and or read
7. The people we surround ourselves with
8. The daily habits we create around trading
9. Keeping a trading journal
10. Trading reviews

The significant difference between what we can and can't control is this little thing called **effort**.

It takes **significant effort** to find, test, understand and lose money when we start trading, the learning curve really can't be understated. Even worse, those who do well initially end up getting ruined because the precedent is set that ""this is easy"". That lack of experience always catches up, be it in stocks or any other pursuit. This is the Dunning Kruger effect in action.

Having logged my trades for a number of years, many patterns show up and repeat themselves most notably in times of duress. For me personally this included the following  - for which I now am 100% accountable.

1. Buying too soon, usually due to FOMO
2. Selling too soon, usually due to fear
3. Buying on tips from Twitter and friends - the worst of the worst, I still fall for this one
4. Not taking trades out of fear

These are just a few which were underpinned by one major theme: **not following my trading plan.**

Sure, I still have my days and even months where I have lost control of my process and am tired, sick of everything and slip up. Yes of course, it costs me money every time and if you think I have down days because of it - you are absolutely correct. The real difference now is I know where I am going wrong, that I can improve it and make serious money trading stocks in the long run. **I know what I can and can not control.**

It all starts with having a clear plan, a very understandable unambiguous trading system, tons of real trades and a meticulous journal to keep track of where you are winning and losing.

Over time, taking these lessons and reshaping habits, patterns and hang-ups to eventually become consistent and eventually have it down to a performance art.

The apex of these points is total control over what you do during the trading day, how you can manage your emotion and execute that trading plan. The ability to follow this plan and learn from will either create or destroy potential traders, especially in the long run.

So, I would like to find lower cap and undervalued stocks with lower institutional holdings. Or do you think the time is different and they own the whole stock market by throwing money at everything?",stocks,Useful websites to find stocks with lower institutional holdings,9.0,0.74

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been doing really well in my yolo account. Decided to give it a go back in September 2020 and as of today I have officially increased it by 1000% (1k to 10k). Going great, but its called my yolo account for a reason. Could absolutely go to zero at any moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I recently changed jobs and finally decided to rollover my IRA. I am looking for some suggestions on what to do with this money. I have about $16.5K in that account now. I do not want to treat this account the same way as my yolo account. I don't want meme stocks or anything like that. I was hoping for some suggestions on ETFs and things of that nature. I do not want to get into any SPACs as I don't  quite understand them fully and I don't know how they will play out on the long term.   


I could just throw it all into SPY and I have definitely considered doing this. Are there better choices though? Any tips on resources would be appreciated. Rather than just throwing tickers at me I would really appreciate some insight as to why you are recommending that ticker.

It’s been publically traded for about a year now and something things I like about it. Seen good institutional and insider buying, 10% short float so has some squeeze potential, and under 1 billion market cap so huge growth potential. Big risk I see is insiders selling off or offerings resulting in share dilution. Anybody else come across this stock and what are your thoughts on longterm hold?  

Edit: I bought 100 shares at $19.00. Looking to sell for 10x in 3 years or 90% loss.",stocks,$CURI longterm hold,7.0,0.83
