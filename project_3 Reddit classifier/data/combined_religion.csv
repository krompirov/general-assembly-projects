Intotherosegarden1,0.0,1886.0,"I am a Christian, but I've always been a bit skeptical about modern medical miracles. I believed miracles were reserved for the early church, when the apostles were still living.

Well...last night at around 10:30, God proved me wrong.

For over 10 years I've suffered with a crippling condition called TMJD, which is dysfunction and inflammation of the jaw joints. It causes severe chronic pain and prevented me from chewing solid food during moderate to extreme flares. It causes lockjaw, so I could only open my mouth a finger's width, two fingers on a good day. Every time I just barely *moved* my jaw a millimeter, my joints would crackle and cause shooting pain. When I opened my mouth--not even chewing or talking--my joints would CRACK CRACK CRACK like someone stomping through gravel in my skull or snapping bones in half. I lived in constant pain even while remaining perfectly still. I'd done long-term therapy, taken medication, but nothing worked. The only (if temporary) solution is botox injections into the masseter muscles, but I couldn't afford that.

On top of that I have bruxism, which is tooth-grinding or clenching. I've chipped teeth and had to sleep with a mouth guard. Bruxism can cause the masseters to be overworked and swollen. Mine were so big they felt like tennis balls and I looked like a chipmunk with stuffed cheeks. The inflammation, soreness, and tension made it difficult to concentrate on anything else, ever.

1/3 of my life I lived like this.

So last night, things were so so bad, my head felt like it would burst, I just started crying, lowered my head, and said, ""Jesus, please take this pain awa--"" 

I didn't even finish the sentence when it happened.

For over a decade, I'd felt like my face and head were tensed and contorted by thousands of bands pulled unbearably tight--they snapped loose INSTANTLY. Every muscle relaxed so fast it felt like my face was melting! The pain was just GONE. I remember jerking my head up and my eyes flew open. I was in shock, blinking at my closet door for about 30 seconds. Then a little afraid to believe, in case it was too good to be true, I carefully moved my jaw side to side. No cracking. I barely opened my mouth--now I could open wide!! My face felt strangely hollow, like a deflated balloon. I was shaking and reached up to feel. My masseters had shrunk back to normal. I'd been malformed for so long I didn't remember what normal felt like.

Thank you, Abba, Father, for hearing the cries of the least of your lambs, the brokenhearted and broken-bodied. You see us, and by your grace allow us glimpses of you, that we may be reminded that our present suffering is nothing compared to the glory you will reveal to us one day!

Last night was the first night in 10+ years that I didn't clench my teeth. I woke up today totally loose and relaxed, pain-free, refreshed--healed.

ChristianConvertHere,0.0,1889.0,"Hello everyone, Christian or not, family or not, friend or not, but a neighbor at the end of the day. 

Today, my grandson introduced me to Reddit and I learned how to set it up and use it. Although, I may run into issues so please don‚Äôt mind me, I am old lol. To start off, I was raised in a Catholic household at a young age in the Bible Belt of the USA. I used to be a firm believer in Christ, bible, church, resurrection, everything. Then, after turning 16, around this time of the year, I started getting very skeptical. When I mean skeptical, I am talking about hours after school continuously questioning and contemplating in my head on whether or not god exists. Then, I became Atheist. It was about 54 years ago so it‚Äôs hard for me to remember but it wasn‚Äôt gradual or subtle, rather, I became Atheist in a matter of weeks. This was also fueled by 2 of my other friends who became Agnostic and Atheist (1 was Agnostic and another Atheist) a few months prior to my conversion. I remember going to their houses and talking with them about the existence of god only to go deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of Atheism. So, to conclude on that part of my life, I became Atheist.

I started getting into secular philosophies. I went to the library, I had to search very hard. I read books and even went to Atheist seminars to strengthen my Atheism. Basically, I was not just the type of Atheist that went ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no god, whatever, I‚Äôll go on with my life, if you‚Äôre religious, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù... No No No, I was the type that would go ‚Äúthere‚Äôs absolutely no daddy sky fairy, you‚Äôre dumb and indoctrinated if you believe in those fairytales, let me show you why Atheism is the real path to truth‚Äù. My Anti-atheism was heavily inspired by my friends and by my reads. The fact that religion caused so many wars, issues, etc. These were my reasons for being anti-Theistic and I believe Theism and Christianity were harmful and cancerous for everyone of its followers.

Looking back at my old self, it is toxic. I am ashamed and I pray for forgiveness from God. Now, this is when my Atheism clearly went too far... I got a tattoo with the Atheism symbol. Yes, that‚Äôs right, at I believe 37 or 38, I decided there‚Äôs no better way to embrace my Atheism now that I lived in a different state (not inside the Bible Belt) than to get a tattoo on my shoulder. Looking back at my foolish, pathetic, and laughable young self, I am unruled by it. Now, I am getting it removed with a laser in about 4-6 weeks. And I will use those scars as a proud reminder of my conversion. So from age 16 till a few months ago, I was a hardcore Atheist and Anti-Theist, my wife who was Presbyterian hesitantly converted to Agnosticism after I would not leave her alone about God and Atheism being the ‚Äútruth‚Äù. Now, I don‚Äôt know why she didn‚Äôt leave me for being the annoying prick I was at the time but God has his ways. For the most part, I was okay, never really happy, satisfied in my work, and always the type of guy who looked forward to his alcohol at night.

Conversion precursor. My retirement was later than many my age. I have always taken care of my body since youth so my work was never really inhibited until about 6 months ago when I had serious back issues. That‚Äôs when I decided to quit and retire for good. Now, I am bored at home with quarantine, nothing to do, the kids can‚Äôt see me anymore nor the grandkids, my wife and I have nothing new to say lol, I am bored like never before in my life. That‚Äôs when my Atheism and Anti-Theistic thoughts sprouted back in my mind. Now of course, I always thought about them but as of the past decade or so, they weren‚Äôt as important anymore. Yes, I still carried around my proud Atheist tattoo, but otherwise, not over powering. 

Now stuck in quarantine, I decide ‚Äúfor once and for all, now that I have nothing to do, I am going to prove Christianity wrong, I will destroy this book of nonsense‚Äù. And just like that, I ordered a Bible from amazon and read it. The Old Testament felt fake to me at the time, so I read the New Testament. That‚Äôs when something clicked in my head and I said to myself ‚ÄúRegardless of how much I hate Theism and think this is all gibberish, it still deserves an equal opportunity. Besides, I will still debunk it regardless‚Äù. So I read it, I did this for a good 2 hours daily. That‚Äôs when I started getting curious. Now with my old age, I felt less anti-Theistic and I felt that was more of an edgy young phase, not something someone my age would do. Now with the internet, I started YouTubing videos on the resurrection, I watched both debunking videos and pro-resurrection videos. I began to seriously wonder if maybe this is the truth. That‚Äôs when I wrote down all my objections to Christianity and the resurrection. I then typed them all in. I got results for all of them believe it or not (the Internet is amazing). I watched them for hours daily. I remained immensely skeptical. Theistic metaphysics is what set my Atheism into flames. After many many many weeks of doing this daily. Quarantine plus retirement plus curiosity can do this lol. So for the first time in 54 years, I prayed, I prayed agnostically and asked god to please show me something of validity of his existence. I expected nothing and thought ‚Äúwhat a dummy I am‚Äù.

Weeks later, my wife goes to the emergency room for a very bad UTI, the antibiotics given days prior were found to be resistant from the bacteria. My wife who is 73 was rapidly deteriorating and the doctors said it might be too late. I prayed to God just for the sake of it to heal my wife who is still Agnostic but not really involved in theology at all.

Now yes, it could be a coincidence but it is important to note how my wife, at the brink of death was saved miraculously. This made me question God.

After 54 years of being a hardcore Atheist and Anti-Theist, I have officially converted to Christianity and accepted Christ. I am now removing my Atheist tattoo. I got baptized today, hurray. Here is my long story (This is my first time using Reddit) Hello everyone, Christian or not, family or not, friend or not, but a neighbor at the end of the day. 

Today, my grandson introduced me to Reddit and I learned how to set it up and use it. Although, I may run into issues so please don‚Äôt mind me, I am old lol. To start off, I was raised in a Catholic household at a young age in the Bible Belt of the USA. I used to be a firm believer in Christ, bible, church, resurrection, everything. Then, after turning 16, around this time of the year, I started getting very skeptical. When I mean skeptical, I am talking about hours after school continuously questioning and contemplating in my head on whether or not god exists. Then, I became Atheist. It was about 54 years ago so it‚Äôs hard for me to remember but it wasn‚Äôt gradual or subtle, rather, I became Atheist in a matter of weeks. This was also fueled by 2 of my other friends who became Agnostic and Atheist (1 was Agnostic and another Atheist) a few months prior to my conversion. I remember going to their houses and talking with them about the existence of god only to go deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of Atheism. So, to conclude on that part of my life, I became Atheist.

I started getting into secular philosophies. I went to the library, I had to search very hard. I read books and even went to Atheist seminars to strengthen my Atheism. Basically, I was not just the type of Atheist that went ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no god, whatever, I‚Äôll go on with my life, if you‚Äôre religious, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù... No No No, I was the type that would go ‚Äúthere‚Äôs absolutely no daddy sky fairy, you‚Äôre dumb and indoctrinated if you believe in those fairytales, let me show you why Atheism is the real path to truth‚Äù. My Anti-atheism was heavily inspired by my friends and by my reads. The fact that religion caused so many wars, issues, etc. These were my reasons for being anti-Theistic and I believe Theism and Christianity were harmful and cancerous for everyone of its followers.

Looking back at my old self, it is toxic. I am ashamed and I pray for forgiveness from God. Now, this is when my Atheism clearly went too far... I got a tattoo with the Atheism symbol. Yes, that‚Äôs right, at I believe 37 or 38, I decided there‚Äôs no better way to embrace my Atheism now that I lived in a different state (not inside the Bible Belt) than to get a tattoo on my shoulder. Looking back at my foolish, pathetic, and laughable young self, I am unruled by it. Now, I am getting it removed with a laser in about 4-6 weeks. And I will use those scars as a proud reminder of my conversion. So from age 16 till a few months ago, I was a hardcore Atheist and Anti-Theist, my wife who was Presbyterian hesitantly converted to Agnosticism after I would not leave her alone about God and Atheism being the ‚Äútruth‚Äù. Now, I don‚Äôt know why she didn‚Äôt leave me for being the annoying prick I was at the time but God has his ways. For the most part, I was okay, never really happy, satisfied in my work, and always the type of guy who looked forward to his alcohol at night.

Conversion precursor. My retirement was later than many my age. I have always taken care of my body since youth so my work was never really inhibited until about 6 months ago when I had serious back issues. That‚Äôs when I decided to quit and retire for good. Now, I am bored at home with quarantine, nothing to do, the kids can‚Äôt see me anymore nor the grandkids, my wife and I have nothing new to say lol, I am bored like never before in my life. That‚Äôs when my Atheism and Anti-Theistic thoughts sprouted back in my mind. Now of course, I always thought about them but as of the past decade or so, they weren‚Äôt as important anymore. Yes, I still carried around my proud Atheist tattoo, but otherwise, not over powering. 

Now stuck in quarantine, I decide ‚Äúfor once and for all, now that I have nothing to do, I am going to prove Christianity wrong, I will destroy this book of nonsense‚Äù. And just like that, I ordered a Bible from amazon and read it. The Old Testament felt fake to me at the time, so I read the New Testament. That‚Äôs when something clicked in my head and I said to myself ‚ÄúRegardless of how much I hate Theism and think this is all gibberish, it still deserves an equal opportunity. Besides, I will still debunk it regardless‚Äù. So I read it, I did this for a good 2 hours daily. That‚Äôs when I started getting curious. Now with my old age, I felt less anti-Theistic and I felt that was more of an edgy young phase, not something someone my age would do. Now with the internet, I started YouTubing videos on the resurrection, I watched both debunking videos and pro-resurrection videos. I began to seriously wonder if maybe this is the truth. That‚Äôs when I wrote down all my objections to Christianity and the resurrection. I then typed them all in. I got results for all of them believe it or not (the Internet is amazing). I watched them for hours daily. I remained immensely skeptical. Theistic metaphysics is what set my Atheism into flames. After many many many weeks of doing this daily. Quarantine plus retirement plus curiosity can do this lol. So for the first time in 54 years, I prayed, I prayed agnostically and asked god to please show me something of validity of his existence. I expected nothing and thought ‚Äúwhat a dummy I am‚Äù.

Weeks later, my wife goes to the emergency room for a very bad UTI, the antibiotics given days prior were found to be resistant from the bacteria. My wife who is 73 was rapidly deteriorating and the doctors said it might be too late. I prayed to God just for the sake of it to heal my wife who is still Agnostic but not really involved in theology at all. Next you know it, 3 days later, she is out of the ICU with no permanent bladder damage. I asked the doctors ‚Äúhow‚Äù, the doctors said something to the extent of ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know exactly, all we know is that your wife was on the brink of sepsis, but the cultures for bacterial resistance came just an hour prior to her becoming septic.

Iamindeedamexican,0.0,1702.0,"All, I apologize if this sort of post is not allowed, as I‚Äôm new to this sub but I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot. This last Friday I was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer called Ewing Sarcoma. I had a surgery about a week ago to remove an abscess in my right humorous and after running tests it was found to be cancerous. At only 25 years old it was a bit of a blow. My wife and I are both strong believers in our Lord Jesus Christ, but it still shook us. The doctor believes he caught it early and that I should do well (saying 80% of patients do just fine with the chemo treatment, with this type of cancer). I‚Äôm going in for a full body scan hopefully this week and we‚Äôre just praying that it hasn‚Äôt spread, and that the treatment can start soon (especially amid all this pandemic craziness). 

To any who are willing, please pray for healing in my life, and peace and a lack of fear for both me and my wife. I know that we should rejoice in our sufferings as it produces endurance, character, and hope but sometimes it‚Äôs just difficult. I love my wife dearly and it‚Äôs also very hard seeing her cope with the possibility of losing me (and we‚Äôve only been married for 3 years). Thank y‚Äôall in advance.

Edit 1 (6/21/20): 
I cannot thank everyone enough for your prayers and well wishes. My wife and I read every single one and we were legitimately moved to tears. Thank y‚Äôall so much for your love, support, and prayers, I can‚Äôt tell y‚Äôall how much it means. It really helped and uplifted us to know there are many out there praying. As some have expressed interest I will gladly continue to edit this post to provide updates. As I was only diagnosed a few days ago, it may be a week or so before I know the plan but I will edit as soon as I find out!

Edit 2 (6/23/20): 
I saw the doctor this morning and it‚Äôs definitely going to to be a tough journey. They are running tests to make sure that it is 100% Ewing Sarcoma before they start treatment as well as if it has metastasized at all (hopefully not). From there it‚Äôs going to be 9-12 months of chemo (and all sessions of chemo must be done in the hospital). It‚Äôs 3 days in for one 2 week session and 6 days in for the next 2 weeks and it just alternates like that. I will more than likely have to quit my job and my wife who has been going to school is going to have to put her education on hold (or cancel all-together). We are talking with a fertility specialist on the possibility of freezing my sperm due to it more than likely not being viable after chemo. There‚Äôs just so much to process and we aren‚Äôt sure how we‚Äôre gonna do it, but I know God will provide. Thanks again for y‚Äôall‚Äôs prayers and if y‚Äôall would continue that would be much appreciated. We have a tough journey ahead. God bless!

Edit 3 (6/30/20):
Thank y‚Äôall for y‚Äôall‚Äôs continued prayers! I finished all my tests and the both the PET scan and the bone marrow biopsy came back negative with any cancer spread (praise God)! We had been specifically praying for no metastasis of cancer and God faithfully provided! Regardless of metastasis or not, my treatment is still the same, but it‚Äôs still just a great feeling seeing examples along the way of God answering our prayers and starting this battle with much better odds. We also received the final pathology reports confirming with certainty that it is Ewing‚Äôs Sarcoma. I believe the plan is to start chemo some time next week, so please continue to pray for peace and strength for what‚Äôs to come (for both me and my wife)! I can‚Äôt express my appreciation enough for everyone‚Äôs prayers! I will continue to update as my journey proceeds! God bless, y‚Äôall!

Edit 4 (7/11/20): 
I just got back from my first chemo treatment and it wasn‚Äôt too too terrible. I still feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù and slightly nauseous but they gave me some pretty good meds that work well. Like I‚Äôve said before it‚Äôs going to be a long bout of chemo (9 months to a year) so I will keep the updates on this post to a minimum and just mention important milestones. But thank y‚Äôall so much for your support and prayers! I will say I‚Äôve received many complements about how well I‚Äôve held up and how positive I‚Äôve been and I can honestly say it‚Äôs all the Lord. Through Him I am sustained and I can see this just completely changing my walk with Christ for the better!

Edit 5 (9/11/20)
I got that comment and thought it would be a good time for an update! I‚Äôve been undergoing chemo for about 2 months now, and so far it hasn‚Äôt been too terrible. I‚Äôve read many stories of people having a terrible time through chemo with side effects, and I really have been coasting through, so I count myself blessed. I have ocasional fatigue (I actually had to get a blood transfusion due to low red blood cell count), some indigestion type side effects, and maybe ocasional nausea and that‚Äôs really about it. I also didn‚Äôt think it would matter to me, but it was definitely a tough ordeal losing my hair. Once it happened I guess it made it more of a reality. It was tough on my wife as well (for the reality check as well,she loves me regardless of my looks haha) but I think we‚Äôve gotten over that and used to the new look now. The next step right now is surgery. So the tumor is in my right upper humerus and they‚Äôre going to be basically cutting off the top half and replacing it with either an allograft (cadaver bone) or titanium. We learned from our new surgeon that the previous surgeon may have contaminated the tissue and he might have to remove a good amount of muscle in my right arm. Also if there is any visible cancer contamination, they will have to do radiation, which will rule out the allograft, because apparently that won‚Äôt heal correctly. The allograft is better though because my body will accept it a bit more and I‚Äôll have more range of motion. However, regardless of the type of replacement, I will only ever be able to lift about 5 lbs with my right arm. So that was a bit of a bummer, but hey, If all goes well I‚Äôll be cancer free and living, so I‚Äôll take it. The surgery is tentatively scheduled to take place on October 7th. Once that happens, they‚Äôll probably wait a few weeks and then the second half of my chemo will start (6-9 months to make sure no microscopic bits are left). I will say though, that the surgeon looked at an x-ray recently and noticed the tumor looked like it was receding and giving good margins for the surgery. So praise God for that! So for all who read this, if you could please pray for continued recession of the tumor and that I can hopefully get that allograft replacement rather than the titanium. Thank y‚Äôall for y‚Äôall‚Äôs interest and support, I really do appreciate it!

Edit 6 (10/7/20):
I‚Äôm not sure if people get notified for updates on this post but I just wanted to post a quick update and prayer request. My surgery to remove the upper portion of my humerus bone is actually this afternoon in a few hours (I believe at 12:30). We are very blessed that the surgeon was able to go the route of using the cadaver bone rather than the titanium which is better recovery and more range of motion. If whoever sees this could just pray for peace and calmness for my wife and also for knowledge and steadiness for the surgeon. They have to remove some muscle so we‚Äôre hoping that they don‚Äôt need to remove too much when they go in there, and also they have to disconnect and reconnect a main nerve so pray that that goes well also. Thank you all for your continued prayers and support! I will post an update after the surgery when I can actually use my phone haha

Edit 7 (10/20/20)
The surgery went really well! They were fortunately able to save the axillary nerve so that was really nice. While in the surgery the surgeon noticed more active tumor than he realized so he had to remove more muscle than he originally planned. This was a bit unfortunate but in my opinion I just want whatever is best for my overall outlook. After the surgery the main concern was the pathology report on the tissue remaining, they wanted to see if they got clear margins. We got the results last Wednesday and they were negative for any cancer cells, so that was just fantastic to hear. In addition we found out that the cancer cells had a rate (if that‚Äôs the right word) of 99% necrosis. The PA said anything above 90 is really good and 99 is the best you can get (it‚Äôll never be 100). Essentially this is a measure of how well the chemo is performing at killing the cancer cells, and in my case it is performing very very well. It also shows a better prognosis overall as the cells are more likely to be completely eradicated by the chemo and less likely to reoccur. I have been in my sling for 2 weeks and it‚Äôs tough but I can use my wrist and fingers just fine so I manage. Fortunately I‚Äôm left handed, so that makes things a bit easier. The plan forward is to get the staples removed in my right shoulder, and then get cleared for chemo. Then I‚Äôll have 6-9 more months of chemo and be done with treatment! It‚Äôs all downhill from here, its just a matter of getting through it. We‚Äôve had nothing but great news and we‚Äòre thankful to God for everything. I appreciate those who‚Äôve prayed for us, God really seems to be answering all our prayers.

I will more than likely have to quit my job and my wife who has been going to school is going to have to put her education on hold (or cancel all-together). We are talking with a fertility specialist on the possibility of freezing my sperm due to it more than likely not being viable after chemo. There‚Äôs just so much to process and we aren‚Äôt sure how we‚Äôre gonna do it, but I know God will provide. Thanks again for y‚Äôall‚Äôs prayers and if y‚Äôall would continue that would be much appreciated. We have a tough journey ahead. God bless!

Edit 3 (6/30/20):
Thank y‚Äôall for y‚Äôall‚Äôs continued prayers! I finished all my tests and the both the PET scan and the bone marrow biopsy came back negative with any cancer spread (praise God)! We had been specifically praying for no metastasis of cancer and God faithfully provided! Regardless of metastasis or not, my treatment is still the same, but it‚Äôs still just a great feeling seeing examples along the way of God answering our prayers and starting this battle with much better odds. We also received the final pathology reports confirming with certainty that it is Ewing‚Äôs Sarcoma. I believe the plan is to start chemo some time next week, so please continue to pray for peace and strength for what‚Äôs to come (for both me and my wife)! I can‚Äôt express my appreciation enough for everyone‚Äôs prayers! I will continue to update as my journey proceeds! God bless, y‚Äôall!

Edit 4 (7/11/20): 
I just got back from my first chemo treatment and it wasn‚Äôt too too terrible. I still feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù and slightly nauseous but they gave me some pretty good meds that work well. Like I‚Äôve said before it‚Äôs going to be a long bout of chemo (9 months to a year) so I will keep the updates on this post to a minimum and just mention important milestones. But thank y‚Äôall so much for your support and prayers! I will say I‚Äôve received many complements about how well I‚Äôve held up and how positive I‚Äôve been and I can honestly say it‚Äôs all the Lord. Through Him I am sustained and I can see this just completely changing my walk with Christ for the better!

Edit 5 (9/11/20)
I got that comment and thought it would be a good time for an update! I‚Äôve been undergoing chemo for about 2 months now, and so far it hasn‚Äôt been too terrible. I‚Äôve read many stories of people having a terrible time through chemo with side effects, and I really have been coasting through, so I count myself blessed. I have ocasional fatigue (I actually had to get a blood transfusion due to low red blood cell count), some indigestion type side effects, and maybe ocasional nausea and that‚Äôs really about it. I also didn‚Äôt think it would matter to me, but it was definitely a tough ordeal losing my hair. Once it happened I guess it made it more of a reality. It was tough on my wife as well (for the reality check as well,she loves me regardless of my looks haha) but I think we‚Äôve gotten over that and used to the new look now. The next step right now is surgery. So the tumor is in my right upper humerus and they‚Äôre going to be basically cutting off the top half and replacing it with either an allograft (cadaver bone) or titanium. We learned from our new surgeon that the previous surgeon may have contaminated the tissue and he might have to remove a good amount of muscle in my right arm. Also if there is any visible cancer contamination, they will have to do radiation, which will rule out the allograft, because apparently that won‚Äôt heal correctly. The allograft is better though because my body will accept it a bit more and I‚Äôll have more range of motion. However, regardless of the type of replacement, I will only ever be able to lift about 5 lbs with my right arm. So that was a bit of a bummer, but hey, If all goes well I‚Äôll be cancer free and living, so I‚Äôll take it. The surgery is tentatively scheduled to take place on October 7th. Once that happens, they‚Äôll probably wait a few weeks and then the second half of my chemo will start (6-9 months to make sure no microscopic bits are left). I will say though, that the surgeon looked at an x-ray recently and noticed the tumor looked like it was receding and giving good margins for the surgery. So praise God for that! So for all who read this, if you could please pray for continued recession of the tumor and that I can hopefully get that allograft replacement rather than the titanium. Thank y‚Äôall for y‚Äôall‚Äôs interest and support, I really do appreciate it!

Edit 6 (10/7/20):
I‚Äôm not sure if people get notified for updates on this post but I just wanted to post a quick update and prayer request. My surgery to remove the upper portion of my humerus bone is actually this afternoon in a few hours (I believe at 12:30). We are very blessed that the surgeon was able to go the route of using the cadaver bone rather than the titanium which is better recovery and more range of motion. If whoever sees this could just pray for peace and calmness for my wife and also for knowledge and steadiness for the surgeon. They have to remove some muscle so we‚Äôre hoping that they don‚Äôt need to remove too much when they go in there, and also they have to disconnect and reconnect a main nerve so pray that that goes well also. Thank you all for your continued prayers and support! I will post an update after the surgery when I can actually use my phone haha

Edit 7 (10/20/20)
The surgery went really well! They were fortunately able to save the axillary nerve so that was really nice. While in the surgery the surgeon noticed more active tumor than he realized so he had to remove more muscle than he originally planned. This was a bit unfortunate but in my opinion I just want whatever is best for my overall outlook. After the surgery the main concern was the pathology report on the tissue remaining, they wanted to see if they got clear margins. We got the results last Wednesday and they were negative for any cancer cells, so that was just fantastic to hear. In addition we found out that the cancer cells had a rate (if that‚Äôs the right word) of 99% necrosis. The PA said anything above 90 is really good and 99 is the best you can get (it‚Äôll never be 100). Essentially this is a measure of how well the chemo is performing at killing the cancer cells, and in my case it is performing very very well. It also shows a better prognosis overall as the cells are more likely to be completely eradicated by the chemo and less likely to reoccur. I have been in my sling for 2 weeks and it‚Äôs tough but I can use my wrist and fingers just fine so I manage. Fortunately I‚Äôm left handed, so that makes things a bit easier. The plan forward is to get the staples removed in my right shoulder, and then get cleared for chemo. Then I‚Äôll have 6-9 more months of chemo and be done with treatment! It‚Äôs all downhill from here, its just a matter of getting through it. We‚Äôve had nothing but great news and we‚Äòre thankful to God for everything. I appreciate those who‚Äôve prayed for us, God really seems to be answering all our prayers.

I had nothing but confirmation today to solidify my faith in The Lord that has been building over the past few days.

I called out for God last Friday, out of faith to come and save my soul and fix me in his image. 

Now I'm not exactly sure how this works but I am happy that he literally saved my life last Friday and tonight, while praying, he saved my soul. I'm excited to walk knowing he is watching after me because he loves me and accepted where I was, and led me to the light. 

The overwhelming peace and serenity feeling that I was having while I was crying was INTENSE LOVE. I was praying for him to save my soul because if he doesn't I was going to kill myself and as I cried out for gods help I then suddenly had 100% faith in him to take control of this situation that devil has me in, and deliver me. I heard a very loud yet subtle voice whisper SURRENDER. So I got on my knees, and asked him to save me because I was so lost that I was about to let the devil win. ""Forgive me for I have sinned and save my broken soul, please help me right now God"".  

HE. DID. JUST. THAT. 

I am so excited to walk this new path with him. Im new to understanding God and Christianity as a whole. I did however, just buy THE WORD OF GOD and eager to get to dive deeper into God and understanding his love and grace.

I was praying for him to save my soul because if he doesn't I was going to kill myself and as I cried out for gods help I then suddenly had 100% faith in him to take control of this situation that devil has me in, and deliver me. I heard a very loud yet subtle voice whisper SURRENDER. So I got on my knees, and asked him to save me because I was so lost that I was about to let the devil win. ""Forgive me for I have sinned and save my broken soul, please help me right now God"".  

HE. DID. JUST. THAT. 

I am so excited to walk this new path with him. Im new to understanding God and Christianity as a whole. I did however, just buy THE WORD OF GOD and eager to get to dive deeper into God and understanding his love and grace. 

GOD BLESS.",accepted god lord savior tonight say never consider believer tonight god literally spoke nothing confirmation today solidify faith lord building past day intense panic attack last friday lead unrecognizable thought accepted truly call god last friday faith come save soul fix image exactly sure work happy literally save life last friday tonight pray save soul excite walk know watch love accepted lead light overwhelm peace serenity feel cry intense love pray save soul go kill cry god help suddenly 100 faith take control situation devil deliver heard loud yet subtle voice whisper surrender get knee ask save lose let devil win forgive sin save broken soul please help right god excite walk new path im new understand god christianity whole however buy word god eager get dive deeper god understand love grace god bless

Status_Macaroon3835,0.0,1526.0,"I come from a very broken home. My mom was a drug addict who couldn't hold work. My siblings and I each had a different dad and I bounced around constantly from staying with my dad to aunts and uncles to friends and everywhere. I didn't have a role model or a strong leader guiding me in the right direction at any point.

Naturally I fell in with a bad crowd. By the time I was 16 I was hanging out with gang members and drug dealers who were in their 20's. Eventually that progressed into me doing drug runs and sex work for them for money. It was the only time I'd ever felt like I belonged somewhere and I didn't want to leave. I didn't realize how deep I was in.

I rose through the ranks of this crew when it came to dealing. I got trusted with higher and higher quantities of supply and cash. The sex work became more frequent too, both for gang members and clients. Eventually they began bringing me along on strong arm robberies and we committed several over the course of about a year before one day we finally got caught.

I was 21 when I was arrested. None of my ""friends"" bothered to bail me out of jail or testify on my behalf at all. I was sentenced to eight years inside. I was 22 when the sentence was handed down. I got out when I was 30.

Prison life was more monotonous than anything. I never really feared for my life or safety while I was inside. I just had a lot of thoughts and not enough time to occupy them. I had become friends with a girl on my cellblock who was a Christian, and she would tell me how important it had been to her to pray and read the scripture, and I became interested.

So every day I started reading the Bible. I checked a little pocket version out from the prison library and paid to keep it long term by doing laundry and janitorial work. Every day I would just read and pray and read some more and I couldn't believe how at peace it made me feel. I could just feel God watching over me and guiding me. He had forgiven me for the awful sins of my past and had given me salvation. I was baptized in prison when I was 27. It's one of more impactful days of my life.

I got out of prison in February 2015. I was 30. I managed to convince my sister to let me move in with her. I had some work to do to convince my family that I was a changed woman. I found work as a private tutor and French teacher but I still want to get involved with the ministry in a more formal way. I want to preach the gospel to kids from broken homes like me and get them on the right path before they end up like me.

While out celebrating my birthday in December 2017 I met the most incredibly guy. He was handsome, he was a gentleman, he was funny, and I could not stop looking at him. We chatted for a couple hours that night and he asked me out on a date for the next weekend. He's also a Christian, and I know that God put him in my life because he's meant to be there. 

We found out last summer we were expecting our first child and he proposed on that day. Our son was born in February and he is a perfect angel. The ultimate gift from God. What a perfect angel our baby boy is. My fiance is an incredible dad and I just cannot thank God enough for putting them both in my life.

My life can be divided up into chapters: Before accepting Christ and After accepting Christ. The person I am now is completely different. I've left my life of crime in the past. I've changed for the better in every way. I talk to my mom about the scripture when we talk now because I want her to know it isn't too late for her to turn things around. She still struggles with addiction and is constantly in and out of drug rehab.

soswinglifeaway,0.0,1491.0,"So I'd like to preface this by saying I am not really looking to debate why I feel homosexuality is a sin or isn't compatible with Christianity. The debates have been had 1,000 times on this sub alone. You can guess which scriptures have led me to this conclusion, and I've heard the counter arguments. So far, my view on this remains unchanged. That isn't really what I am looking to discuss.

I live in a fairly conservative area, and a lot of people who I am friends with or am acquainted with who consider themselves  Christians try to vote through a biblical lens. They feel that because they are a Christian they must vote against things like legalizing gay marriage, because homosexuality goes against their religious beliefs. I personally do not feel it is our duty, or our right, to impose our religious views upon the world through legislation.

I see a lot of people who identify as Christians who believe homosexuality is a-okay and therefore support gay rights through legislation. I see a lot of people who identify as Christians who believe it is sinful, and therefore vote against this kind of legislation. But I don't come across many people like myself who personally feel that it violates their religious beliefs, yet do not feel compelled to vote against this kind of legislation.

I liken it to if a Jewish person tried to impose legislation on the rest of us to make eating non-kosher meats illegal. Just because it violates their religious views, it does not mean that the rest of us should be legally compelled to be held to that same standard. I think this is the kind of thing that falls under the separation of church and state, which I believe in. 

So this is why as a Christian I feel I can support LGBT rights and believe homosexuality is a sin, but not be a hypocrite.",1,"I personally feel that homosexuality is sinful/not compatible with Christianity.

I see a lot of people who identify as Christians who believe it is sinful, and therefore vote against this kind of legislation. But I don't come across many people like myself who personally feel that it violates their religious beliefs, yet do not feel compelled to vote against this kind of legislation.

I liken it to if a Jewish person tried to impose legislation on the rest of us to make eating non-kosher meats illegal. Just because it violates their religious views, it does not mean that the rest of us should be legally compelled to be held to that same standard. I think this is the kind of thing that falls under the separation of church and state, which I believe in. 

So this is why as a Christian I feel I can support LGBT rights and believe homosexuality is a sin, but not be a hypocrite.",personally feel homosexuality sinful compatible christianity however still support lgbt right think contradicts christianity wish christian would stand topic like preface say really look debate feel homosexuality sin compatible christianity debate 1 000 time sub alone guess scripture lead conclusion heard counter argument far view remains unchanged really look discus live fairly conservative area lot people friend acquaint consider christian try vote biblical lens feel christian must vote thing like legalize gay marriage homosexuality go religious belief personally feel duty right impose religious view upon world legislation see lot people identify christian believe homosexuality okay therefore support gay right legislation see lot people identify christian believe sinful therefore vote kind legislation come across many people like personally feel violates religious belief yet feel compel vote kind legislation liken jewish person try impose legislation rest u make eat non kosher meat illegal violates religious view mean rest u legally compel held standard think kind thing fall separation church state believe christian feel support lgbt right believe homosexuality sin hypocrite

gabeheaglesfan,0.0,1220.0,"Hi, I am new to this, so here is my story: 

I am 25 years old. I have a Christian Family and my Gf's Family and her as well are ali very Christian. But not me. I Always defined myself as agnostic but would get into discussions trying to discredit Christians in debates etc.. I've changed since that and learned to respect all beliefs but still agnostic and thought there was Nothing science couldnt explain. 

Well... last year we found that my gf was pregnant but her amniotic sac broke with 13 weeks of pregnancy, so the baby probably wouldn't survive. My gf was very Strong and held up really well during that time, drinking a lot of liquid and she spent 50 days at the hospital for monitoring. When she was around 30 weeks the doctor said the baby lungs were too small and it would be an issue. Well, my daughter was Born within 32 weeks of the pregnancy, had to spend 1 month in ICU but her lungs were fine! The doctor later Said the chances of her survival were close to none. Now she is almost 1 year old and is the cutest and happiest baby I have ever seen in my life. 

Another ocurrence that happened to me one of these days was that I should have been killed in traffic, but something strange happened. I was going home from work, and I have to drive through a big highway, and I got sleepy at around 100 kmh. When I opened my eyes there was heavy traffic in front of me and I stepped in the breaks but my car lost control and started spinning. There should be a lot of cars around me but this time there were none. As the car stopped, I saw there were no cars behind me, and only in front of me, so I didnt crash into anything. Then, the cars started to show up behind me only after that. It was a miracle. 

But I was still skeptical. 

Now for about a week or so, I'm feeling depressed and very anxious about the purpose of life and my role in this world, and that after I was dead there would be the end and I would never see my daughter again. So I was very sad.

I decided to take a bath tonight to cool my head and looking at my celphone I decided to google ""how to have faith in god?"". One of the steps was basically to introduce yourself and pray and etc. So I went into the bath, closed my eyes and did Just that. 

I said that I was Sorry for not believing for 25 years and that I am Sorry that I still have my doubts but I am willing to change and Will do my best. Suddenly I felt something that I swear I cannot explain and started crying, but I was happy and not feeling depressed anymore. I don't know what happened but I was feeling great. That was God, I think. 

So I said the my gf that after this pandemic I Will go to church with her, as well as studying about christianity. This is my story! Thank you if you read it all of it. I Just really wanted to share my experience with someone.

SkepticalBrooo,0.0,1197.0,"Long story short: I was born in a catholic/orthodox family then later on developed my own opinion on religions and started to see them like some sort of delusion. Hearing my mother talk about Christianity sounded like fiction and kinda cringe. I hate to be this person but she sounded ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù.

After losing faith and officially viewing religion as something false that humans created to fear a lot less about the unknown, I entered an existential depression that seemed to never end.   I kinda developed a nihilistic attitude towards life and was very pessimistic about everything. I was at my lowest points for several months. 

I tried finding solution like turning to spirituality. I noticed that spirituality was a lot talked on the internet and saw it everywhere. ‚ÄúBecome your own God and make your own reality with the law of attraction‚Äù. Basically you think in a negative way you will attract that negativity and think in a positive way and you will attract that positivity. 

Me, the depressed human I was back then. I tried to think positively but still felt incapable, hopeless and so alone. I needed SOMEONE to pick me up from that dark place and rescue me. My heart never sat right with spirituality and decided to come back to Christianity. God finally called me. Since my last post about my pornography problem, I took everyone‚Äôs advice and asked God to release me from this addiction. 

I was saved. I can‚Äôt believe after years of having this problem, being a very sexual person... touching myself do not cross my mind anymore. I now view sex like something so intimate and powerful that has to be done in total privacy away from the world‚Äôs eyes. Porn now disgust me. I deleted twitter, there was lots and lots of girls promoting their OnlyFans and someone who viewed this like something normal and making ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù. My mind changed on that.
I still do not judge those people. On the contrary I want to pray for them. I want Jesus to save them.

A couple of days ago I prayed and I felt something. So powerful. I felt something in my heart, I can‚Äôt really describe it. It‚Äôs like something lives in my heart if that makes sense? During my prayer I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I went to the washroom crying like a baby. Came back to my room crying a third time. There was something new in me. THIS was the experience I wanted to experience for a long time. Everytime  I speak about God to my mother I start crying. I‚Äôm still overwhelmed. My prayers that felt empty years ago now I feel like there‚Äôs someone listening to them! I feel someone. God is POWERFUL.

I do not feel depressed and hopeless anymore. I feel accompanied in my life journey. The more I pray the more I have stronger Faith in our Lord. 
I noticed also that I‚Äôm a LOT less angry, I cuss less and most importantly I‚Äôm calm. God offered me his serenity. A gift that I will carry with me all of my life. I‚Äôm grateful for my spiritual journey to God and I LOVE ALL OF YOU. There‚Äôs no words to describe how much I love this sub. You guys are so calm, peaceful and ready to help anyone who struggles. Thank you for existing.",1,Jesus saved me. GOD IS GOOD.,1197.0,0.94,"Jesus saved me. GOD IS GOOD. Long story short: I was born in a catholic/orthodox family then later on developed my own opinion on religions and started to see them like some sort of delusion. Hearing my mother talk about Christianity sounded like fiction and kinda cringe. I hate to be this person but she sounded ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù.

After losing faith and officially viewing religion as something false that humans created to fear a lot less about the unknown, I entered an existential depression that seemed to never end.   I kinda developed a nihilistic attitude towards life and was very pessimistic about everything. I was at my lowest points for several months. 

I tried finding solution like turning to spirituality. I noticed that spirituality was a lot talked on the internet and saw it everywhere. ‚ÄúBecome your own God and make your own reality with the law of attraction‚Äù. Basically you think in a negative way you will attract that negativity and think in a positive way and you will attract that positivity. 

Me, the depressed human I was back then. I tried to think positively but still felt incapable, hopeless and so alone. I needed SOMEONE to pick me up from that dark place and rescue me. My heart never sat right with spirituality and decided to come back to Christianity. God finally called me. Since my last post about my pornography problem, I took everyone‚Äôs advice and asked God to release me from this addiction. 

I was saved. I can‚Äôt believe after years of having this problem, being a very sexual person... touching myself do not cross my mind anymore. I now view sex like something so intimate and powerful that has to be done in total privacy away from the world‚Äôs eyes. Porn now disgust me. I deleted twitter, there was lots and lots of girls promoting their OnlyFans and someone who viewed this like something normal and making ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù. My mind changed on that.

NelsonMeme,0.0,1181.0,"As many of you know, Pope Francis habitually has a left-leaning stance (see the examples below.) I intend to show, however, that this recent rightward shift is actually healthy.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Pope_Francis_South_Korea_2014.png

Notice how Pope Francis has his left shoulder down in this photo. His weight is clearly on the left foot, as is to be expected.

The same thing is true here: His Holiness, whether sitting or standing (I can't tell,) has his left shoulder down, indicating more weight on his left side.

https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pope-francis-bolivia2.jpg

However, recently Pope Francis has been seen putting his weight on his *right* foot, rather than his left. Take this example from September:

Don't be deceived by the dipped left shoulder, the crucifix he wears is showing how gravity is aligned, and it is clear that his weight is on his right foot.

The reason this is good is that the NHS in the UK says that ""hip-hanging"", or the practice of allowing one hip to sit lower than another is a common cause of lateral hip pain, something Pope Francis would likely be more susceptible to due to his age. While the ideal would be a balanced stance, it makes sense to me that not always favoring the same leg would at least be better.

He seems somewhat fine, but with covid, things can get bad quick. I cant have him die. He came by to get h ik a suitcase because he is staying at his bosses 2nd house, and I saw my rough, tough love, usually annoyed dad cry. I watched as he drove away as he cried his eyes out. 

I'm 13, and he is the only income we have. If he dies, well lose the house, the cars, everything. I cant handle this much stuff at once. 

How he got it makes me mad. Real mad.

I cant do this anymore. I was already depressed, my best freind is moving away in a week, and now my dad has covid.

JoeB-123,0.0,1049.0,"When I was in college, there were many who were sent by God to try to help save my soul, and some of them were called 'Campus Crusaders For Christ.'  And they almost succesful, but I guess that I had WAY too much childhood abuse to recover from, until I could feel comfortable amongst all of those 'bubbly' Christians that I had just met.  So I went off on my own and tried to solve my problems with drugs, I got into a bad marriage, etc.; but, then I met my current wife...my gift from God and a truly wonderful woman, who helped me to heal.  And although I didn't know it, God was right there all along watching over me, so that I didn't get into any more trouble that what I already had gotten into.

As I had drifted for my whole life, I had tried to trust in my feelings for spiritual fullfillment, but that never ever got me very far.  Then, members of a cult called 'Heaven's Gate' killed themselves, my son was about to be born, and I asked myself: ""what was my purpose in this life anyway?""  I could not understand how so-called 'Christians' could kill themselves, and if my son had ever asked me WHY it was wrong to hurt people, I would have been unable to answer him.  I also had this INCREDIBLY empty feeling deep inside my heart, and I knew that I needed spiritual fulfillment..AND PRONTO!  (Later on, I realized that the Heaven's Gate cult members were not Christians after all.)

So I was compelled to read God's Holy Bible on March 31, 1997, and God reached down to me.  Every word that I read from the Bible that night EXPLODED off the page deep into my heart, and as I gave my life over to Jesus, I began a process of repentance, forgiveness and purifying my soul that has not stopped to this day!!  AND I pray that it NEVER will and that I will ALWAYS experience the peace and passion of God's Love in my heart, now and forever!  Amen!  Thank you Jesus!  I love you so, Jesus!!

God bless you all who post here and are reading this now, and may His light shine down upon each and every one of you and keep you safe from harm...especially you younguns.  Keep the fire of Jesus burning brightly in your heart for others to see, OK!?  Take it from one who has MADE the mistakes: you don't need to experiment with the dark side of life AT ALL, because Jesus can save you from ALL of the suffering that sinning can cause.  And for those of you who like to witness to non-believers: if I can be born-again at age 40, then ANYONE can!  It's NEVER too late!  Good luck in all of your ministering the Word of God to everyone that we meet every day.  God bless....

[deleted],0.0,1023.0,"Dwell on that one for a bit. I would assume that most of us reading this have access to healthcare, food, water, shelter, and any other ""necessities"", along with a life of excess which provides us internet, expendable money, and other luxuries. If God gave us breath, we should live a life of worship.

This quote came from a missionary speaking to my pastor one day... He was trying to impress that in more impoverished areas of the world, people hold on to His Word. Most live lives of commitment to His name and keep Him in their heart all the waking hours. Although someone may only have 100 dollars to their name, they would give 75 to their neighbor to help with medical expenses or food. If we believe the Scripture, we know that God thrives in the hearts of the weak and the oppressed. People in these countries have felt God's love, they know that there is something way better than their current situation. They know, that the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, Jesus Christ, died for them so that they could one day reign in paradise. Sure, their worldy situation sucks today, but life is not about air condition and video games. They are rich!!!! Their Spirit is full and alive with the breath of the Holy Spirit!. Life is worship, and worship is life. They hold on to this truth, and they have some of the best relationships with God, as evidenced by their spiritual hunger and desire to be with the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit!

This quote really hit me in the chest. We,  Western Christians, have access to everything we could ever need to better the world. We have the ability to radically change peoples lives. I have the ability to talk to countless Christian followers through this post. I could go on for hours, but I honestly have limitless resources. Do I use those, on a daily basis, to live, spread, and try and teach the Word? No, I am ashamed to say. I absolutely do not. I would rather indulge in worldly desires such as video games, shopping for myself, and doing other things that make me happy.

How terrible is that? We have been given limitless resources to try and change the world, but we have become so engulfed in ""Me"", that we do not even realize what ammunition we have. God has sharpened our swords and given us the armor to fight for him. I use His Sword to crack beers. I use the Spiritual Shield to shelter myself from the rain. I put on the Lord's Armor to keep myself warm.

Today I will do better. I will start using my resources to help the world... to promote change. I will put on my Armor, grab my Shield, and raise my Sword and fight along the, let me say it again, Undisputed, Heavy-Weight Champion, Risen Lord!

The rest of the world is resource-poor but commitment rich.""",1023.0,0.96,"""Western Christians are resource-rich, but commitment poor. The rest of the world is resource-poor but commitment rich."" Dwell on that one for a bit. I would assume that most of us reading this have access to healthcare, food, water, shelter, and any other ""necessities"", along with a life of excess which provides us internet, expendable money, and other luxuries. If God gave us breath, we should live a life of worship.

This quote came from a missionary speaking to my pastor one day... He was trying to impress that in more impoverished areas of the world, people hold on to His Word. Most live lives of commitment to His name and keep Him in their heart all the waking hours. Although someone may only have 100 dollars to their name, they would give 75 to their neighbor to help with medical expenses or food. If we believe the Scripture, we know that God thrives in the hearts of the weak and the oppressed. People in these countries have felt God's love, they know that there is something way better than their current situation. They know, that the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, Jesus Christ, died for them so that they could one day reign in paradise. Sure, their worldy situation sucks today, but life is not about air condition and video games. They are rich!!!! Their Spirit is full and alive with the breath of the Holy Spirit!. Life is worship, and worship is life. They hold on to this truth, and they have some of the best relationships with God, as evidenced by their spiritual hunger and desire to be with the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit!

I call myself agnostic but a better term is probably ex Christian, which I feel is probably much harder for Christians to deal with because we have 'known the truth and chosen to reject it'. I know I never knew what to do with them as a Christian.

To give you some context, I am not new to Christianity. At all. I grew up in it and believed with all my heart. I had been filled with the spirit, spoke in tongues, knew my identity in Christ. I wrestled with questions about hell, morality and death, went through extremely hard times and never forsook him or denied him once.

So what came next was unexpected.

In my late twenties I began questioning what I believed from a logical and historical perspective, not just an emotional one based on untested assumptions. This was coupled with an unwelcome doubt I couldn't shake or pray away.

This questioning and subsequent lack of convincing answers led me to deconstruct and eventually deconvert, despite the things I had previously experienced. The illusion shattered. The Jesus I knew didn't exist and I had been simply been brought up to believe one religion out of many.

I grieved and still do in some ways because I'm not sure I believe yet.

I didn't post this to say I was coming back to Jesus because some people on Reddit were nice to me, I still have many doubts to reconcile outside of this platform, but more to say that being civil with people like me who may come across as aggressive is more helpful than it may seem. I know that if I had been met with 'you never really believed' or something suggesting I just don't want to see God and it's my fault, then that would have likely just pushed me further away.

I just want the truth.

I had an offline conversation with one of you and summed up how I feel there - I miss Jesus terribly. I just don't know if he's real.

Update: 1:20 pm - mom is out of surgery, will wake up in an hour or two and I will be there while my sister is at work and my father can't see her because it is one visitor only policy due to covid. It is 90% glioblastoma.

Update: It is a rough diagnosis indeed. My sister and I are trying to stay strong. Our father hides his sadness... he's trying to stay positive and strong for us in his own way. His father passed away last year too.. For him it really is quite devastating and she's five years younger than him. 
I arrived back at home tonight around 10 pm and will be back tomorrow with her at 11 am. 
They couldn't remove alot of it.. a small portion because it's in a very dangerous area for mobility and speech.. we don't know how long she has. She seems so healthy now it is hard to believe that her time is limited. 
She really wanted to go back to Korea if she didn't have much time left, her home country, to see her 6 sisters and be where she was born but that doesn't seem to be likely...
Thank you for your thoughts, cares and prayers everyone.
Trying to get her back at home before the weekend is arrives..
She doesn't know as well as us that she doesn't have much time left. She suspects it, but I think she's keeping optimistic but that she is a little oblivious to it.. I am praying to Saint Joseph, Saint Peregrine and Archangel Raphael for strength, deliverance, mercy, grace, and help. 

*****Also, I wanted to say. I'm not necessarily asking for a miracle. I'm just asking for prayers for strength, courage, faith, peace, and for as much time as God is willing to give us to be together before He takes her.

khizee_and1,0.0,979.0,"(Warning) Possible ongoing scam in Islamic Subreddits

 Salam Alaikum,

I just want to warn people of a **possible** ongoing scam going in some Islamic subreddits. 

There seems to be a weekly post on Islamic subreddits about somebody asking for duaa because of tough financial situations.  These are usually very sad circumstances described that naturally make us want to help. 

The first one that I have read about 3 weeks ago was basically a Muslim man asking for duaa because he was in the brink of committing a crime to feed his family, due to financial struggles related to Covid19.

I felt some type of way about it and decided that I would help.

Eventually, after talking to him, I discovered multiple red flags that prevented me from sending money :

1- The account is new and only has that specific post.

2- He immediately knew a way to transfer money from a company (worldremit) even though he has no relative that he knows outside of this country (Nigeria)

3- I believe he posted the same post on ¬´ Christianity ¬ª subreddit; the post was removed but I was able to see the comments and they were basically sending him prayers and lifting his spirit up. 

4- At the end, just to be sure, I pretended like I knew someone in Nigeria and asked him if it was okay for that person to deliver food for him. He was not for it because he did not want to bother anyone else. 

Every now and then, I keep seeing similar posts but with different accounts. The last one that I have seen was yesterday and it was a man asking for duaa because he did not have the money to pay for his daughter medical fees.

I decided to message him to see if it was possibly the same person.  

It seems like it is: The account his new and only has that specific post, he is from the same country (Nigeria), he wanted me to use the same company to transfer the money (worldremmit) and he couldn't provide me with the bill that showed the need of that 300$ requested by him.

Could it be just a pure coincidence? Possibly.

I was really reluctant on making this post because Allah knows how much we should help people if they are really in need but scammers often prey on emotions and vulnerability. If it is a scammer, giving him money is just going to give him more incentive to keep going while there are some people out there who are really struggling. 

**Please, the only purpose of this post is to remind you to minimally investigate before sending any money to strangers.**

May Allah help people who are suffering all over the world and give us the opportunity to make a change.",1,Warning. There is a possible scam going on in religious subreddits.

[deleted],0.0,977.0,"So, I was just a regular person or so I thought, I lived a good life with a well paying job, a wife and a dog. I felt pretty safe in my day and enjoyed many of the things that other people enjoy, like movies, restaurants, watching youtube, riding my bike. The real problem was that, behind my apparent happiness which felt real I was struggling with an addiction that was destroying my entire life and my relationships without me even realizing it. My addiction was porn and masturbation, and it affected my life up until 3 months ago where I finally was able to stop watching porn and masturbating completely.

I was raised Catholic in a nice family. I attended church every Sunday as by my parents will. However, I was never really able to what faith was and to be honest I never really experienced God's love in my life. To me it was just a routine to please my parents, a boring one hour Mass that I attended up until I was 16 when I was finally able to make my decision to leave.

For the next 17 years I haven't put a foot in a church, or went to confession, I never prayed, maybe if I wanted to ask the Lord to help me get the job I was interviewing for, maybe one Hail Mary said badly every other year or so.

At 32, I was married, with a nice job, a loving dog and all the thigs I could dream about. I really felt like my life was going well, but was so I wrong!!! Especially in the last year of my married life, thigs were not going well, my addiction to porn and masturbation was getting worse. I was really not in control but I didn't even realized how much it was affecting my life and my relationships.

I was so oblivious to everything that was going on in my head that looking back, only now, when I am finally free from it, I can't believe how low I could go and how so normal it felt back then, isn't porn just a normal things in our lives? Doesn't everyone watches it? How bad can it be? Does it really affect anyone but myself? Those were my believes.

I really tough I was not addicted to porn, but where should we draw a line? I also felt like it only affected me and nobody else, and it was nobodies business to know or to even comment about it. Even my wife knew I was watching porn and she thought it was ok, I guess I haven't told her how much it was ruling my life and or relationship. On my part I was not really interested to stop, it feels so good after all, and there are no problems related to it, right? It's not life drugs or alcohol that ruin your health, masturbating is almost necessary, maybe even a good thing some people say.

Well let me tell you, I was so hooked I didn't want to see the problems and was far from being able to stop anytime soon.

I reached a point where my porn addiction was really driving my day, I remember waking up and really looking forward to watch porn. At times I was really hoping my wife would leave the house so I could have my pleasure time. I got to the point were I watching porn almost anywhere, at work, in public places. The drive was really high and could not really stop myself, as soon as the thought came up I was rushing to somewhere quiet and start watching porn.

My sex life was normal, or so I thought, I remember I was starting to get anxious if my wife was interested in sex because if that same day I had watched porn, my libido was down I didn't really feel attracted to her too much. I was basically at the point where porn was way nicer than sex with my wife, way more interesting and captivating. And could it not be? With a click I was able to pick and choose my partner, any style or perversion was right there in front on me for free. Nothing wrong right? everybody does it!

The more I masturbated to porn, the more distant I grow from my wife and she started taking notice. Mostly she felt unsecure about her body, she felt she was not attractive enough to turn me on, and she felt like it was all her fault. Our relationship started to be more and more cold, more and more distant and this led to some big fights. However the fights were not about porn but about the stress and the hanger that it was creating in me when I indulged into it.

At some point, like many other times I decided to trying quitting or at least reduce the influence it had on me. This time I was reading that cold showers cold be of some sort of help, so I gave it a shot and like many other times it lasted about 3 days, after which I went right back at it. I guess it was not effective, and how can it be? If you don't wanna stop, cold showers won't really help you.

I remember I then switched to prayers, being raised catholic in my childhood I thought I would give it a shot. I promised myself to at least say 3 Hail Mary before I would start jerking of, that too didn't really work immediately, I was still doing it, but slowly I started noticing some signs around me that got my attention. I remember that sometimes, before opening my laptop and going on my favorite porn website, by pure chance, my mom or a friend would send me a message on my phone, or maybe a call would come and catch my attention. At the beginning I didn't really spent too much time thinking about it, but after a few times it had happened I start wondering if this could have been some sort of a message from ""above"". To many of those coincidence started to pile up and I started to take notice.

The moment that really changed everything, was the moment were I started watching videos on YouTube about the life of an Italian Saint called Padre Pio. While listening to his life and the miracles he performed I stumble on a video that said how he would not give absolution during confession for certain kind of repeating sins, and one of them was masturbation. I don't know why, but that really strike me and made me feel uneasy about my situation. Few days passed and after few more videos describing Padre Pio's miracles something clicked in my head and I remember I was hit by the realization that the miracles he performed and which were described and documented by so many people around the world were actually real and that God was really present in his life.

In that moment, I remember I rushed and kneeled on the floor because God was right there watching me. I stayed kneeling down while watching a video which was about 24 minutes which by ""coincidence"" was the exact number of years I had been masturbating (started as a child at 6, now 32).

I told God that I would be offering every minute of that video for every year I had been jerking off in my life.

After that day, for some reason I don't really understand I started saying the rosary while taking my dog on walks in the morning. Again I would just listen to some recordings from YouTube. After a few of them, maybe a week, I started feeling a real presence of Love in me. It was a really weird feeling that brought me to tears, however, I didn't feel sad but what I would describe as joy, a really overwhelming feeling of love. That same experience happened several times after, but it was not always there every day.

After some time, I realized I was not really drawn to porn anymore, I was able to stay without pornography or masturbation for 10 straight days. I remember I didn't even felt the drive to do it, and was feeling very strong in that regard. For some reason, I decided to fast and to offer that sacrifice to the Lord, I think the idea came about as Padre Pio himself used to fast so I fasted for 3 days straight, only hate breakfast. I think that was also part of the process, even if it only happen after my initial conversion.

As of today it has been almost 2 months without porn or masturbation and I really believe that saying the rosary daily was the great helper for my change.

I will strive to keep it going as far as I can, hopefully my whole life. There are difficult days and a twice I felt back to my habits. But, this won't stop me, the Lord gave a second change to have a free life and I won't give it up.

It feels good to be free from something that enslaved me for about 24 years of my life.

Good luck to you if you are going through the same process, keep praying, going to confession and to Mass. Your freedom and life are worth more than 5 mere minutes of pleasure that will never appease you, but on the contrary will ruin you and the people around you.

Many people ask me about my sex life with my wife and if it has changed.

I'll be extremely honest with you, after I confessing everything to my wife she is having a really hard time now, and how to blame her. It's a miracle we are still together but she is seeing this huge change in me which is the only thing that gives her hope. I pray that everything will get better, mostly for her, who suffered the most because of my addiction. At the same time I am happy I told her because she needed to know that it was not her fault that I was being a real dick to her in the past 7 years of our relationship. I'll keep praying for her. We had sex once in the past 2 month.  It felt good, I could be present in the process and not finding myself fantasizing about porn, but there is still more trust that needs to be rebuilt in our relationship. I am tying to give her time and show her the love and the respect that she always deserved

Thank you everyone for your encouragement and prayers! It makes me feel so good that I am able to help others and I also feel stronger the more support I get. I believe there are many more people that are suffering for this same very problem. Porn can be worse than any other addiction, it is free and easy to get, not like alcohol or drugs. I wish you all the best, stay strong and say your prayers!

Anyway, I thought it would be encouraging to others to post a testimony that involved my dad.

When he was a young Christian, he really sought after God. While working in a factory, he started a bible study with some of the other employees. And they would meet at the top of a very tall and steep staircase in a small room, once a week. 

One day, a large man (6'3"" 350lbs) who worked with him (he was black but that's not relevant to the story, just a notable characteristic) asked my dad if he would pray for him. The man had a bad back and working in the factory made it worse. Without thinking about it, my dad told him that if he comes to the bible study tomorrow morning they will all pray for him. 

So the next morning comes and several members of the bible study have arrived and are in the room at the top of the stairs. Sitting up there they start hearing large booms coming from this old creaky wooden staircase. One after another is actually causing the small room they're in to start shaking. Immediately, my dad realizes what he's done and can't believe he told a man with a bad back to climb this staircase. 

He gets to the top of the stairs and my dad starts to apologize for being so inconsiderate. The man interrupts my dad and tells the group that as soon as he started climbing the stairs, his back pain went away. When they prayed it was to thank God for His wonders. And for the rest of the time they worked together, the man attended bible study and didn't have back pain.",1,"Yesterday, I posted about being suicidal.

Tomatootamot9,0.0,907.0,"I was reading a blog recently about why so many people (especially young people) are rejecting Christianity in the West these days. I kept seeing suggestions and answers that ranged from ‚Äúliberal brainwashing‚Äù to ‚Äúthey had it too easy‚Äù and other senseless stuff. It did make me wonder though, why is it happening?

I think it‚Äôs genuinely because we (especially Americans) have tended to dumb down Christianity to the point where it just isn‚Äôt a sensible religion to be a part of. I‚Äôve been to many churches in my life (within many denominations) and I notice a common theme in most. 

1.) There is absolutely no sense of reverence left. God is just a super powerful version of a human that‚Äôll set your ass on fire if you piss him off. Jesus is our boi tho. He helps our favorite team win football games, helps us pay our bills or get new jobs, he gives us ‚Äúblessings‚Äù by making pretty sunrises or something, etc. God kinda sorta has rules we are supposed to follow, but mostly he doesn‚Äôt care and we just have to ask forgiveness real quick.

2.) The church isn‚Äôt the body of Christ. There isn‚Äôt any unity and submission before God. Christians these days tend to be super individualistic and look for a fun church that ‚Äúfits them‚Äù. We‚Äôve all got our own relationship with God that is unique to us. We get in disputes over which preacher to hire because ‚Äúthis one is boring‚Äù or whatever. We argue over how to decorate the church, what music to play, etc. Church really just becomes a shitty version of a club. The entertainment is boring, the look is meh, and the music is a knockoff of soft rock. 

With these things considered, I really do wonder if it even makes sense to call a 21st century non denominational church (just as an example) the same religion as a 4the century Roman church. They really don‚Äôt seem like the same type of thing or like they worship the same type of God.

TLDR: We‚Äôve presented a watered down, stupid version of Christianity to the masses and so now lots of people say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs stupid, no thanks‚Äù and then we are shocked and whine that kids these days don‚Äôt wanna go to church.

vociferant-votarist,0.0,899.0,"Freezing rain on the 11th caused nearly 90,000 people in the area to lose power, forcing many families to go to extreme measures to keep their families warm. The temperature in the area has not risen above freezing for several days and there are reports of fatalities due to the cold and from motor vehicle accidents. Hotels in the area are booked for days and, and in rural areas, many business are closed. As of earlier today 20,000 remained without power in Kentucky and 10,000 in WV.

To add to the plight of these people, a second wave of freezing rain has hit the area tonight, knocking out power to nearly a hundred thousand additional homes, some of which have just had their power restored in only in the last 24 hours. A third wave of precipitation (several inches of snow) is projected for Wednesday night.

Freezing rain on the 11th caused nearly 90,000 people in the area to lose power, forcing many families to go to extreme measures to keep their families warm. The temperature in the area has not risen above freezing for several days and there are reports of fatalities due to the cold and from motor vehicle accidents. Hotels in the area are booked for days and, and in rural areas, many business are closed. As of earlier today 20,000 remained without power in Kentucky and 10,000 in WV.

To add to the plight of these people, a second wave of freezing rain has hit the area tonight, knocking out power to nearly a hundred thousand additional homes, some of which have just had their power restored in only in the last 24 hours. A third wave of precipitation (several inches of snow) is projected for Wednesday night.

I personally think I have very good relationship with God, and me and my wife have been praying (mostly thanking) during lunches together. I think we have always been thanking for more things in comparison to things we have been requesting/asking for.

My wife become pregnant, God blessed us with a baby. 

My wife had very common (quite easygoing) pregnancy, but at the end of it things become complicated and there were multiple risks according to doctors. They had to induce labor quite fast - but covid were against time (because of tests, waiting and so on..), and time was of the essence.

Despite that, we received from God a healthy baby, even though the delivery was extremelly painful for my wife.
Between last weeks of pregnancy and delivery itself I had been praying very instense. I think they were the most intense prayers I have ever managed to say. God replied and made a miracle, I am extremely thankful for the act He did and only with my continuous hope I can thank Him for that.

Dear God, I love You. Thank You being extremely close to me during these hard times. Thank You for sending Holy Spirit to us. Now I know I can rely on you unconditionally!
I want to encourage all of you to put your complete trust into Him. It is worth it! God is worth it!

[deleted],0.0,859.0,"Myself (35), my sister (40), my brother (32) and my younger sister (30), were all raised in an Assemblies of God Pentecostal church here in Melbourne Australia.  
It was my mother who took us every Sunday. I went to Sunday school as did my siblings and I learned a lot there.  


My mother used to dabble in the occult, she was always searching for something, always had a void in her life.   

She began to study with JWs who knocked on our door and also my fathers father was a devout JW, who actually died because he refused a blood transfusion. My Aunt and uncle also are JWs. My fathers father was abusive and my father never practiced or followed any religion. He is still unsaved.   

I don‚Äôt remember how my mum got saved as I was only a baby but I do know she has a copy of the JW Bible, and a copy of the KJV. And if I recall, the Holy Spirit showed her all the discrepancies and she wrote them all down in the JW Bible. She presented this, along with evidence from old watchtower magazines, to my fathers father and my aunt. She tried to show them that their religion was not correct and they consequently disowned our family for that.   

So my Mum found the Lord and we attended this AOG church. We were all dedicated to Christ by the pastor there. It was a nice church and felt like a family.     

My mum has always been big into end time prophecy, wary of occultic symbolism and some other stuff, she was kind of radical which I didn‚Äôt understand at the time. 
She wouldn‚Äôt let us watch Disney movies or the simpsons or play with toys like my little pony etc. My siblings and I weren‚Äôt allowed to do/ play with/ watch the things that the other children our age were doing.

We mainly were allowed to watch Christian cartoons and listen to Christian music. I remember when my sister bought her first CD, when CDs became a thing, it was a Michael Jackson CD and if I recall, my mum made her burn it.    

I can understand all this now because I understand how occultic the world is and how Satan tries to push all this on children, but as a child, I didn‚Äôt understand and I felt left out, like I never fit in anywhere. I always struggled to make friends.     

I can‚Äôt remember when exactly it was but I guess I was about 12 years old, when this odd movement entered into our church.   
It was called the Toronto blessing and apparently there was a ‚Äònew gift‚Äô of the Holy Spirit called ‚Äòholy laughter‚Äô.    

Some people from the church went overseas to get hands laid on them to receive this gift and bought it into the church along with teachings of Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Hagin, Benny Hinn etc who I believe are false prophets and heretics (I‚Äôm not sure if you agree with them but look into it, they are teaching a false gospel).


My mum tried to warn the church pastor and elders and presented them with proof, but they didn‚Äôt listen. So my mum took my siblings and I out of the church and we never found another as my mum was (I think) petrified of false teaching and found fault with every church she went to after that. But she kept her faith, even though it went cold over time she didn‚Äôt stop believing, as the years passed, she did allow my younger brother and sister to do/watch/play with things that my older sister and I would never have been allowed to though.   

When I was 13 or 14, I went to a party with some bad crowd from my school. I lied to my parents about staying at a friends home as my parents were very strict and didn‚Äôt allow parties or boys.
There were older people there, brothers of the girls from school and their friends.    
I wanted to fit in so I got drunk and smoked weed and consequently was passing out unconscious and was raped by 2 men in their 20s. I had been a virgin.    

I didn‚Äôt tell my parents because I was afraid and my life just spiralled out of control after that.    

I dropped out of school, began smoking weed daily. My first visit to a psych ward was when I was 14, for drug induced psychosis where I was put on psych meds and by the age of 18 I was using party drugs like speed, ecstasy and GHB.  

By the age of 19 I was smoking meth and injected heroin for the first time. I became a heroin addict. I had 2 abortions within 3 months because I was so reckless.   
I went to the ER by ambulance over 10 times for drug overdose but I wasn‚Äôt trying to kill my self, I just had something else controlling me (demons) and I would consume as much drugs as my body could handle until I passed out. I knew no limits. I was severely depressed.   
I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, poly substance abuse, psychosis and OCD.  

My mum frantically tried everything to help me, taking me to all these specialists and had all these people praying for me. But if she tried to tell me about Jesus, I would get into a fit of rage. I didn‚Äôt want to hear about it.

I engaged in homosexuality with other women and also prostituted myself for money and drugs.
I was a lost wretch.   

When I was about 21, I was sitting in a car with a guy I was seeing. He was smoking meth and was an ex heroin addict. But I was smoking meth and injecting it as well as heroin. My syringe was blunt and I couldn‚Äôt find a vein. I hadn‚Äôt slept for days. I had makeup all over my face, my clothes were filthy, my hair a mess and I had blood running down my arms from all the failed attempts at injecting. I was borderline psychotic from meth and lack of sleep and I just couldn‚Äôt stop trying to jab myself with this blunt needle.
I remember the guy looked at me and told me I was being disgusting.    

And all of a sudden I felt a presence right in front of me in the passenger seat, I can only describe it as the Holiness of God.
I saw myself, I saw what I was doing, and I became so ashamed. I began to sob. I told the guy something like ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt me! I‚Äôm supposed to be a Christian!‚Äù   
And he thought I had lost the plot.  

I felt so ashamed and hopeless that I decided to commit suicide. I took my things and ran out of the car and down the stairs of the multilevel car park we were in. I planned to go down to the street below (a notorious heroin hotspot) and score and get some fresh syringes and shoot up the entire amount to end my life.   

There were these volunteers who used to patrol that street with backpacks full of safe injecting kits which they distributed for free to addicts to help curb the AIDS issue. They were called the foot patrol.   

I used to get really crazy from meth and call up these counselling helplines and as I was running down the stairs of this carpark sobbing, I thought, I wish there was a God helpline where I could call a Christian to pray for me.    
Then I said a prayer, I said ‚ÄúGod, if you are real, if you exist, you need to show me right now, otherwise I‚Äôm going to kill my self‚Äù.    

When I got out into the street I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck as I saw one of my dealers talking to a clean cut guy with a backpack who I assumed was the foot patrol.   
I ran up to them frantic and interrupted them saying I needed to score and needed syringes ASAP.    
My dealer looked annoyed and told me to wait. So I turned to the guy with the backpack and I asked him ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the foot patrol yeah?‚Äù And he looked at me so confused. And then he smiled at me and answered me and said ‚Äúfoot patrol???? I‚Äôm the SIN patrol‚Äù.    
And then my dealer said to me ‚Äújust wait, this guy is telling me about Jesus‚Äù.    

I BROKE DOWN and began to sob wildly and I cried ‚ÄúI want to know about Jesus! I was just praying to God!‚Äù    
So this guy sent his sisters to me to witness to me. It was a Christian guy and his sisters who would go out into this drug filled street with gospel tracts and try to reach the lost.    
The sisters looked like nothing I‚Äôd ever seen before. They almost glowed, their faces were peaceful, they radiated love. And they witnessed to me and they invited me to come and stay at their home and that they would look after me. They were so kind, so pure. But I wasn‚Äôt able to respond. I was so thick into my sin that I couldn‚Äôt surrender, I couldn‚Äôt let go and give my life to Jesus. They asked if I wanted to, they told me He could save me on the spot but I was afraid. So I refused.    

These girls wept over me as I departed from them. They begged me not to use drugs and told me if I died, I could end up in Hell. They gave me their phone number on a pink post-it note and I promised to call them on Tuesday. (It was a Saturday).    

So I went and scored, I got a hotel room with some addicts who I barely knew and I overdosed on heroin and GHB.    
Nobody called an ambulance. When I woke up I was alone in that hotel room and they had stolen everything from me. My drugs, my money, my bag full of clothes, my phone, birthday gifts I‚Äôd bought for my younger sister, everything was gone. Almost.  
In the corner of the hotel room I saw the only thing they had left, this pink post-it note with the Christian girls number on it.   

I called my parents to help me get home and they were so angry and tired of my antics. But I remember saying to my mum, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry mum, I met some Christians‚Äù. And I gave her the post-it note.    
Then I went to sleep and slept for 2 days. My body was exhausted.   

I began methadone maintenance for heroin addiction pretty much right after that. My dad would take me to get my dose at lunchtime and I‚Äôd take it and it knocked me out so bad as I was on other meds too, I‚Äôd sleep the rest of the day. 
It was a cycle, wake up, take my dose, sleep, repeat.    

My mum (unbeknown to me) had called these Christian girls and asked for their help, because she knew that this was no life for me. I wasn‚Äôt living. I was a zombie.   
My mum organised with the girls to come and get me on a Saturday morning and take me out to breakfast, then to take me to get my dose and bring me home.    
She never told me because she knew I would refuse to go.    

Well on the Friday night before the girls were supposed to meet with me, my parents went to some event and I was left home alone. I took a bunch of pills and even tried to inject some random painkillers. I don‚Äôt know why I did that other than that I was demon possessed.     
My parents come home to find me unresponsive and my lips were blue. I wasn‚Äôt breathing.
They called an ambulance. The ambulance gave me 5 shots of narcan (to reverse opiate overdose). It didn‚Äôt work.   

I was taken to hospital and my parents were told that either I wouldn‚Äôt make it, or that I would be brain damaged. So all my family came to say goodbye.   
And then my mum remembered that the Christian girls were meant to come the next morning. So she messaged them telling them what happened and to cancel breakfast.   
They asked to come to the hospital. And they came with their brother and cousin (who I‚Äôd never met).    

They told me that in the car driving there, the cousin asked if I was blonde, he said he‚Äôd had a dream the night before of a blonde girl in a hospital bed, with evil in her belly, demons, and that she needed to vomit them out. (So weird I know).    
So while they are driving they start praying that I would throw up these demons.    

And while they were doing that, I began to throw up. I was semi conscious. I was swearing, screaming in agony, thrashing violently, my head felt as though someone was banging it with a metal bar, I was having flashbacks of my childhood and seeing snakes in every flashback. The tubes that the doctors had connected to me also turned into snakes (I was hallucinating obviously). The pain was so bad and I could smell something I‚Äôd never smelled before, I can only describe that scent as Hell.   

When I stopped vomiting, I slipped into a coma. The Christians arrived and my mum told them what had happened and they were like wow! We were praying for that!    
I wasn‚Äôt responding to pain tests (where they use a sharp object on you to test your consciousness). I was hooked up to some machine I forget what it‚Äôs called but it‚Äôs the one that has those waves to show you‚Äôre still alive.    

There was only supposed to be 2 people allowed in the room with me but a doctor let all the Christians in and they were praying over me and had their bibles and praying in tongues etc.
I don‚Äôt remember this as I was unconscious. But the story has been told to me by them and my family.    

One of the girls told me she grabbed my hand and said ‚Äúin the name of Jesus, squeeze my hand‚Äù. And I did weakly squeeze her hand. They began to sing a song ‚Äúeagles wings‚Äù I loved it from church when I was young. They told me I was moving my lips, trying to sing.   

But then something happened, whilst I was unconscious, I heard a voice, a calm, soothing voice, telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre tired, give up, you‚Äôve been fighting so long, just go to sleep forever, end the pain‚Äù. Or something like that.    

(2 Corinthians 11:14 ‚ÄúAnd no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light‚Äù).   

And I listened, and I gave up. And I felt my soul leave my body. I felt my hand slip through the hand of the Christian girl and I felt myself rise above my body to the ceiling where I looked down and saw my lifeless body. I saw the Christians, my family, and then I saw the machine which I was hooked up to, stop making waves. It was just a line. Meaning I had died.   

When that happened, everyone began to wail and one of the Christian girls yelled my name, saying ‚ÄúNO! CRY OUT TO JESUS!‚Äù     
And she said that with a raspy, weak voice, I whispered, ‚ÄúJesus, help me‚Äù.      
And after that the machine went back to normal. My soul went back into my body. And I fell into a deep sleep and stayed in that hospital for days.   

When I came out of hospital, I went and lived with the Christians for a while. They taught me the bible, prayed with me, I was set free from cigarettes and drug addiction and they laid hands on me to receive the Holy Spirit.    

I did experience God, I experienced Him speaking to me and had a hunger for His Word. I would read the Bible from morning to evening, suddenly it all made sense to me.    

My conversion was short lived because I didn‚Äôt surrender my all, and soon enough I was back in with my old group of friends, worse than before.    
I‚Äôve been a drug addict for the best part of 20 years of my life (I‚Äôm 35).     
Heroin was my drug of choice with meth as a close 2nd. I also used Xanax and other such drugs and was always heavily medicated.     

I have been to a Christian rehab, where I lasted only 3 months of which was meant to be a 12 month program.     
I have been on the methadone program 4 times, suboxone 1 time.    
1 year ago I tried to go cold turkey off 20mg of methadone. I lasted 3 days before scoring and shooting up heroin and going back on the program. I‚Äôve been on it for pretty much the entire past 3.5 years. 

A month ago, I had a boyfriend who I had been with since last June. (He is also a meth/heroin addict and also on methadone). I was smoking meth daily. I was on antidepressants and 75mg of methadone in Jan. I tapered down to 40mg of methadone.     

I cried out to God and He made a way out of that toxic relationship for me and I went cold turkey off my 40mg of methadone 10 days ago, i stopped my antidepressant 3 weeks ago (approx).

I‚Äôve experienced barely any withdrawal symptoms except for a pain in my right side, the sciatic nerve. I would like to ask for prayer for healing for that. And I hope my testimony encourages someone.     

I was into homosexuality, I was a thief, demon possessed, mentally ill, depressed, borderline suicidal, prostitution, I‚Äôve had abortions, I was a fornicator, a liar, prideful, deceitful, a filthy wretch and Jesus has removed all of my emotional hurt, all of my desire to sin. He has cleansed me and is making me whole day by day.     

He is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.   
Our time on Earth is short and I am so thankful that the Lord has mercy on me and called me back to Him.

But then something happened, whilst I was unconscious, I heard a voice, a calm, soothing voice, telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre tired, give up, you‚Äôve been fighting so long, just go to sleep forever, end the pain‚Äù. Or something like that.    

(2 Corinthians 11:14 ‚ÄúAnd no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light‚Äù).   

And I listened, and I gave up. And I felt my soul leave my body. I felt my hand slip through the hand of the Christian girl and I felt myself rise above my body to the ceiling where I looked down and saw my lifeless body. I saw the Christians, my family, and then I saw the machine which I was hooked up to, stop making waves. It was just a line. Meaning I had died.   

When that happened, everyone began to wail and one of the Christian girls yelled my name, saying ‚ÄúNO! CRY OUT TO JESUS!‚Äù     
And she said that with a raspy, weak voice, I whispered, ‚ÄúJesus, help me‚Äù.      
And after that the machine went back to normal. My soul went back into my body. And I fell into a deep sleep and stayed in that hospital for days.   

When I came out of hospital, I went and lived with the Christians for a while. They taught me the bible, prayed with me, I was set free from cigarettes and drug addiction and they laid hands on me to receive the Holy Spirit.    

I did experience God, I experienced Him speaking to me and had a hunger for His Word. I would read the Bible from morning to evening, suddenly it all made sense to me.    

My conversion was short lived because I didn‚Äôt surrender my all, and soon enough I was back in with my old group of friends, worse than before.    
I‚Äôve been a drug addict for the best part of 20 years of my life (I‚Äôm 35).     
Heroin was my drug of choice with meth as a close 2nd. I also used Xanax and other such drugs and was always heavily medicated.     

I have been to a Christian rehab, where I lasted only 3 months of which was meant to be a 12 month program.     
I have been on the methadone program 4 times, suboxone 1 time.    
1 year ago I tried to go cold turkey off 20mg of methadone. I lasted 3 days before scoring and shooting up heroin and going back on the program. I‚Äôve been on it for pretty much the entire past 3.5 years. 

A month ago, I had a boyfriend who I had been with since last June. (He is also a meth/heroin addict and also on methadone). I was smoking meth daily. I was on antidepressants and 75mg of methadone in Jan. I tapered down to 40mg of methadone.     

I cried out to God and He made a way out of that toxic relationship for me and I went cold turkey off my 40mg of methadone 10 days ago, i stopped my antidepressant 3 weeks ago (approx).

I‚Äôve experienced barely any withdrawal symptoms except for a pain in my right side, the sciatic nerve. I would like to ask for prayer for healing for that. And I hope my testimony encourages someone.     

I was into homosexuality, I was a thief, demon possessed, mentally ill, depressed, borderline suicidal, prostitution, I‚Äôve had abortions, I was a fornicator, a liar, prideful, deceitful, a filthy wretch and Jesus has removed all of my emotional hurt, all of my desire to sin. He has cleansed me and is making me whole day by day.     

He is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.   
Our time on Earth is short and I am so thankful that the Lord has mercy on me and called me back to Him.

I do want to clear some stuff up and that's why I'm putting this edit at the top of the post :). I want to apologize, profusely, and I want to thank everyone who pointed out the shortcomings in this post. I regret making this post. Honestly I really meant this as a humorous post in these troubling times of trial for our global community. Stuff like this happens, and I wanted to make light of it. That's not to create an excuse for myself, with the gift of hindsight and God-given advice from some of you this post does come across as angry and insulting when it doesn't need to be at all. I think too much of my actual frustration came through. Again, I appreciate all of you who pointed this out, I did not, thankfully, strangle her nor did anyone else. It was a mistake, and one that was acknowledged by her and one she was not ridiculed or punished for. I will be leaving this post up, as a lot of you have found it quite funny and I am still delighted in that fact. It is good to laugh :). It should also serve as ""what not to do"" as well, I am not comfortable hiding my failings.

**TL;DR:** I messed up the tone of this post, my frustration got the better of me, I apologize. Thank you all who pointed this out :). I will be leaving the post up.

**Original Post:** Resident tech guy here, managing video stream and slides for our regular Sunday service. I have never wanted to *yell* at someone for being *stupid* so much before now.

We run a simultaneous Facebook and Zoom stream for our church. Facebook is public, Zoom is just for us. This woman shared our private Zoom password on Twitter. *After being told it was private AND after being involved in discussions regarding trolls.*

So guess who showed up halfway through our service? A raiding party of trolls bringing lots of obscenities and some very sinful images. They were not interested in our series on Exodus.

Thankfully we swiftly applied some exodus on them anyways and things are back to normal now. Please pray for me that I won‚Äôt angrily chew out our pastor‚Äôs wife for this. God loves everyone, even those who are significantly less tech-savvy and wield less brainpower than the rest of us.

That's not to create an excuse for myself, with the gift of hindsight and God-given advice from some of you this post does come across as angry and insulting when it doesn't need to be at all. I think too much of my actual frustration came through. Again, I appreciate all of you who pointed this out, I did not, thankfully, strangle her nor did anyone else. It was a mistake, and one that was acknowledged by her and one she was not ridiculed or punished for. I will be leaving this post up, as a lot of you have found it quite funny and I am still delighted in that fact. It is good to laugh :). It should also serve as ""what not to do"" as well, I am not comfortable hiding my failings.

**TL;DR:** I messed up the tone of this post, my frustration got the better of me, I apologize. Thank you all who pointed this out :). I will be leaving the post up.

**Original Post:** Resident tech guy here, managing video stream and slides for our regular Sunday service. I have never wanted to *yell* at someone for being *stupid* so much before now.

We run a simultaneous Facebook and Zoom stream for our church. Facebook is public, Zoom is just for us. This woman shared our private Zoom password on Twitter. *After being told it was private AND after being involved in discussions regarding trolls.*

So guess who showed up halfway through our service? A raiding party of trolls bringing lots of obscenities and some very sinful images. They were not interested in our series on Exodus.

Thankfully we swiftly applied some exodus on them anyways and things are back to normal now. Please pray for me that I won‚Äôt angrily chew out our pastor‚Äôs wife for this. God loves everyone, even those who are significantly less tech-savvy and wield less brainpower than the rest of us.

Thanks hahaha.",please pray strangle pastor wife edit hey folk make post proceed forget woke morning ton notification quite lot attention post mine haha want clear stuff put edit top post want apologize profusely want thank everyone point shortcoming post regret make post honestly really meant humorous post trouble time trial global community stuff like happens want make light create excuse gift hindsight god give advice post come across angry insult need think much actual frustration come appreciate point thankfully strangle anyone else mistake one acknowledge one ridicule punish leave post lot found quite funny still delighted fact good laugh also serve well comfortable hiding failing tl dr mess tone post frustration get well apologize thank point leave post original post resident tech guy manage video stream slide regular sunday service never want yell someone stupid much run simultaneous facebook zoom stream church facebook public zoom u woman share private zoom password twitter told private involve discussion regard troll guess show halfway service raid party troll bring lot obscenity sinful image interested series exodus thankfully swiftly apply exodus anyways thing back normal please pray angrily chew pastor wife god love everyone even significantly less tech savvy wield less brainpower rest u thanks hahaha

Donald Trump is a man who has incited racial hatred. He was the inspiration for the Charlottesville march of white supremacists. He has retweeted and quoted neo nazis and fascists. He was the inspiration for the man who killed George Floyd. He is an openly arrogant and proud individual. He has no business quoting scripture unless it's in the context of repentance for the evil and wickedness that he openly promotes. And the religious leaders backing him have no business invoking the name of Christ. They are like people mentioned by Micah who give prophecies from a price and delude themselves into thinking God is on their side.

""Woe to those who make unjust laws to those who issue oppressive decrees, to deprive the poor of their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people, making widows their prey and robbing the fatherless.

King James Version
4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

Man is the head of woman so that would apply to women as well.  

May Jesus bless you.  May God bless you.  Jesus is the only way to heaven because He fulfilled every prophecy, lived a sinless life, and then died for our sins, so that we may have a life-line to God.

The Bible says God is love and the greatest form of love is that a man give his life for his friends.  That‚Äôs what Jesus did for us after living a sinless life, doing many miracles, fulfilled every prophecy (prophecy still being fulfilled, just started snowing in Jerusalem, another major prophecy fulfilled, pandemics, signs in heavens, biggest solar flare in 3 years, search 2 preachers YouTube channel to see more about the natural disasters, search Jesus prophecy videos and Jesus healing people videos on YouTube, you‚Äôll see the miraculous, people being healed of blindness, deafness, paralysis after many years, etc.), and Jesus died for our sins.  God the father sent His son to die in a human body for us.  Jesus is God and He is the only way to heaven.  You can read more about the Holy Spirit, God the father, and Jesus in the Bible.

Maolchalann,0.0,750.0,"Critics of Christianity and Scripture often cite Deuteronomy 22:28-29 as evidence that Scripture or Christians advocate for rapists to be married to their victim (below is the NKJV translation):

&amp;nbsp;

'If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out, 29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the young woman‚Äôs father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her; he shall not be permitted to divorce her all his days.'

&amp;nbsp;

I am sure at some point you've seen this. This passage however is not speaking of rape, but rather of extramarital fornication. In the era that Deuteronomy was first written, any sex outside of marriage was seen as a violation, both of a woman's sanctity and her father's honor. As such, the punishment here is upon the man with whom the woman fornicated - as far as the Israelites were concerned, he had seduced her and tricked her into fornication, and now to restore her honor he would have to marry her and care for her for the rest of his life. This is also because the reality was that most men did not want to marry a woman who had already been slept with by another man, and as such it would have been hard for her to find a husband (and thus a provider), and it would have meant her father having to be a provider for the rest of his and her lives.

&amp;nbsp;

In the preceding verses, Deuteronomy 22:25-27, death is prescribed to rapists, and it specifies that no harm should be done to the woman, for she has committed no sin:

&amp;nbsp;

'But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the countryside, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die. 26 But you shall do nothing to the young woman; there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death, for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter. 27 For he found her in the countryside, and the betrothed young woman cried out, but there was no one to save her.'

53mV,0.0,748.0,"I have heard from some Christians participating in the recent quarantine protests that they are not afraid to risk getting the disease because God will protect them, while I respect their faith, I think they are making a mistake.

Proverbs 22:3 says ""The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty."" As you can see, avoiding potentially dangerous situations(such as a large protest) is not cowardly, it is in fact wise.

‚ÄúIf You are the Son of God,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthrow Yourself down from here. [**10**](https://www.biblehub.com/luke/4-10.htm)For it is written: ‚ÄòHe will command His angels concerning You to guard You carefully; [**11**](https://www.biblehub.com/luke/4-11.htm)and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.‚Äô[*d*](https://www.biblehub.com/bsb/luke/4.htm#fn) ‚Äù [**12**](https://www.biblehub.com/luke/4-12.htm)But Jesus answered, ‚ÄúIt also says, ‚ÄòDo not put the Lord your God to the test.‚Äô‚Äù Again here, just because God may protect you doesn't mean you should go out of your way to test it. You don't want to jump off the boat because you have a life jacket.

Finally, think bigger than whether or not you will get the virus, 1 Corinthians 8:9 says ""But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak."" While the paragraph this passage is from comes from a debate on food, I believe the ideal still applies. If God protects you from the virus but it passes from you to someone you know who is truly vulnerable, then your liberty(freedom) from the fear of disease is a stumbling block to someone else's health. Even if the virus doesn't enter your body, so much as it sticking to your hands can hurt someone you care about.

in conclusion, while the Bible says that risking your lives for others is a virtue, it is only a virtue if it is for others. Breaking quarantine to protest doesn't help others, it hurts the vulnerable around you and contributes to the overwhelming of the healthcare system, and is at the least very foolish. In conclusion, just because you *can* expose yourself to the disease and be personally protected, doesn't mean you *should*.

‚Äú*Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness*.‚Äù (James 1:2-3)

‚Äú*In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith‚Äîmore precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire‚Äîmay be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

So, there is suffering for the Christian. But after the suffering comes the glory. Christ has become more than a model for His people, and more than even a substitute for us, though He is both of those. He has united us to Himself, filling us with His own Spirit, conforming us increasingly to His own image, bringing us finally to His own home.

We have every reason to persevere and stand firm in our faith. For we have been born again to a living hope of salvation longed for by the prophets and guaranteed by Christ‚Äôs resurrection. This living hope has made us into God‚Äôs people and has empowered us to stand firm by living accordingly. As we live lives of holy love, submitting ourselves to all God-ordained authorities, we stand firm, making the decisive break with sin that tries to lead us away from the Lord. As we humble ourselves to serve one another and submit to God, the Lord will one day exalt us just as He has already exalted Jesus.

ztp1234,0.0,707.0,"Been seeing a lot of this crap from Covid-19 and riot-related stuff.

For all of history since revelation has been written, people get called Anti-Christ, this illness or disaster is a sign of the end times, or this is proof that god will be returning soon.

Christian or not, the whole ""end-times"" stuff has to stop. Jesus was pretty clear when he said even HE  didn't know when the time was... Getting sick of the whole ""OMG THE RAPTURE IS COMING ANY MINUTE NOW"" If you go on youtube, you can find a video featuring years 2005-2020 (2005 being when youtube started)where someone said the rapture was happening that year.

People think they are using that to help, but honestly it's a example of crying wolf, you've been wrong every time when it does happen... people will think it's sheer coincidence and worship the beast... The crying wolf needs to stop NOW. If these so-called ""Saints"" spent the time they spent on end times mess, doing what Jesus did consistently... More people would be brought to heaven. Nobody wants to hear the world is ending, they need to hear Jesus died for them.

Revelation is clear that those with their name in the book of life will not take the mark ""Whether they're raptured or they are murdered."" The concern needs to be saving souls, not explaining to someone who hasn't gone to church since 3rd grade the events of revelation are coming to pass any minute (When Jesus clearly stated that nobody knows when). 

The black plague, The fall of Rome, Many worse natural disasters then what have been happening recently have come to pass since Jesus rose again, none of these are examples of God's soon return (Even if this was valid, soon in God's time might be 400 years). 

I beg of everyone not to share the ""Bill Gates is going to administer the mark"" or ""Covid-19 vaccine is going to be satanic (when people have taken multiple vaccines)"" Why not post pictures of you and your family doing things together that make people thing ""what is different there?""

Mini rant over lol.

Edit: A few things I wanted to add after reading messages and the overwhelming response.

1. The rapture or tribulation could happen in 5 seconds 5 minutes, hous, 500 years 5,000 years. I dont know 

2. My #1 point of this post, Jesus asked us to ""share the good news"" not ""make people aware of the 7 year tribulation.""  The Bible actually says only those whose name is in the book of life will not take the mark. 

3. I'm telling you how people feel from a non-Christian point of view. Scaring people to believing, even if you are successful, never results in true love for Christ.

4. I have spent days of time studying the tribulstion, i am educated on it, I just feel its not a major concern, 5 minutes... is all it takes to lead one person to christ... there are hour long videos that spent 58 minutes of scaring and damning sin then the last 2 minutes say get saved or go to hell.

I was severely depressed last year. I had been suicidal for months. I was a zombie, I would sleep 16+ hours a day, shower once a week, and alternated between crying and staring at a wall. I have no idea how I finished undergrad. I have depression and anxiety and PTSD from childhood abuse and rape. I started to truly believe that things were never going to get better, that all the world has shown me was cruelty and pain. 


Switching gears, my brother converted to Christianity a few years ago. We grew up in a staunchly Jewish household- any dissent from such religion would never be tolerated. So my brother has kept this a secret from my parents, but he had informed me. He would mention Christianity in passing but I just looked at it as his coping mechanism that worked for him when he got out of rehab (he‚Äôs been clean for 4+ years, thank you Jesus!!). He‚Äôs the best brother a girl could ask for :) 


The night of this story, I was walking home from a bar where I had been with friends. I remember standing there watching everyone else be happy and just had this moment of ‚Äúholy shit I literally don‚Äôt know how to do that‚Äù and I just walked out. Halfway home, I just started sobbing. I have never been so hysterical in my life, I was on the sidewalk just crying my heart out. The pain was just too too much, and I decided this was it. I was going to go home and hang myself. I went home and wrote a note. I locked my door and slid the note under my door telling my roommates not to open the door and to call the police because I didn‚Äôt want them to find my body. I stood holding the belt I was going to use and had my phone in the other hand. It was 2am. My brother goes to bed by 9 because he has to get up at 4:30 for work. I decided to call him, and I said to myself this would be my last-ditch effort. If he didn‚Äôt answer that was it. 


My brother told me he was sound asleep when he suddenly sat straight up in bed. His phone was turned off across the room (he keeps it off at night so people from his work don‚Äôt call him- he works at a rehab) but he was overcome with this desire to go get it and turn it on. The second he turned it on was when he got a phone call from me. 


I never believed in God before. I thought religion was a nice concept and all but I never paid attention to all the ways God was working with me in my life. I know somehow something told my brother that he needed to go to me, and I know now that God has a greater purpose for me to serve. I‚Äôm sitting here crying at 4am typing this but I really wanted to share. I feel this pure connection and peace when reading the Bible, talking about Christianity, or listening to sermon. I‚Äôm only a few months in here (took my first communion in December on Christmas) and I know next to nothing (my brother called me today to tell me happy Palm Sunday and I was like uh do I give you a high five what does that mean).

Edit:

It's virtually impossible to get to everyone's questions here and in a largish number of DMs so I'm going to put a few points here so that the answers I am able to give will at least be new rather than the same stuff over and over.

1. This is not a weird kind of self-hate and I'm a mentally stable person. I have reached a point in my spiritual life where I want to leave the shallows and head into the depths and that means abandoning identities which no longer really communicate who I am or what I stand for. I no longer wish to engage with the world ""as a gay man"" but as a man who seeks union with God. These two are mutually exclusive both because the path of Orthodoxy only licenses sex within a heterosexual marriage and because ""gay"" is usually a primary identity. I am moving far beyond defining my identity by my sexuality.
2. Although my libido has naturally decreased anyway, I'm still attracted to men and that's a fact of life. I think attempting to change that is a waste-of-time, unlikely to happen and the methods of so-called ""conversion therapy"" are damaging and an insult to human dignity.
3. This decision has not been born out of a sense of God's judgement but a real sense of God's love. It is a love so profound that giving up sex genuinely does not feel like a big deal.
4. Even by the standards of contemporary gay Western men, I have had an active sex life and those experiences are nothing compared with the mystical experiences that I have had and which have led me to Orthodoxy. We live in a time in which sex is put on a pedestal and actually it's a pretty mediocre pleasure compared with other experiences which are possible but which most people don't even know exist.
5. I don't stand in condemnation over other gay men. Like any person who believes they've found something worthwhile, I'd like to share my experiences with my brothers but wherever they are in their journey, I'm here for them.

DeeDeeeMegaDooDoo,0.0,695.0,"So a month ago, exactly on April 4th, I (16F) started reading the Bible for the first time, and it was the first time I felt my brain active and opened widely to understanding these beautiful words of God! I started with 1 Samuel as it was the one my friend, once again, Alex, had told me about that was her favourite!
Even though it was tough to understand, I still found myself able to imagine David's journey!

So what really happened to make me convert, you may ask? Well let me tell you one heckin crazy story!

I live in a Muslim household, a strict one, I may say. Both my parents implemented the thought that Christianity was stupid and some messed up religion. Which I, as a young child, thought was true. 

Even when I knew this, every time I was taking the bus back home from school, I'd stare at churches, and try to peek inside them, curiosity crazily encouraging me to go inside, but fear of my parent's anger stopped me.

One of my favourite verses that I found written on the entrance of churches was this one:

Jesus said, ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.‚Äù 
I was so curious, what did that verse mean? Was it a quote from the Bible? Or simply a wise saying? 

Then the more I grew, the more I learned about how perfect children, who were raised in a church, are. How they share love and kindness, how they treat people in a good manner, how they keep their places clean. You bet as a young child I really wished I could attend church so they could teach me how to be like them! (Manners wise, thanks to my parents, I was very hateful towards the belief.)

And so, because my parents were religious, they sent me to a very Islamic school, which to this day, I despise  alot. I learned all about Islam in there, and was extra holy, except, when I started understanding things better I stopped praying like how Muslims do. I was so upset with myself for not being a good Muslim, since prayer was almost as important as believing in God, that is for Muslims.

The more I remember, the more I realize how brainwashed everyone was. How they all told part of the truth, to keep the religion going. However, as a student, I sadly didn't have many friends, and I am not that close to my family, and I used to come home and cry very often, begging God to let me have some friends, just one friend so I wouldn't be lonely!!

But of course, what would praying to an imaginary man do to me? There is one true God, so who I used to pray to, had no power to help me whatsoever.

After leaving that crappy school to a less terrible one, I finally found my prayers answered! I befriended the whole school!!! Yeaay!!
Only to change schools the very next year. And I got cut off all my friends, why? Because they were too poor to actually afford technology to message me.

However, from that year, I had one dear friend stay close to me, an internet friend, and the greatest friend I've ever made. That's right, Alex.

Alex and I were so close, it was almost as though we were two sisters separated by a world. But that never stopped us from being close.

Accidents happened and for a short while, me and Alex weren't as close, but it felt so wrong, life felt so empty without them, and for that reason, I decided it's time to fix up what has been broken. I was going to fix my friendship with them. No matter the cost.

Month after month, Alex started growing a better relationship with me through a common hobby, art. We both enjoyed drawing so much, and with her help, I developed the talent I adored and was able to draw as much as I dared!

A year later, we decided to step up our game, and strengthen our friendship more through something common as well, and that's when we both started writing several stories together.

I was very happy talking to Alex about things we both loved, making up stories was our passion, and it only kept improving by the minute!!

then in August-September, I came across something that broke my heart to a million pieces. It destroyed a huge portion of the happiness Ive built up for years. I discovered that for Muslims, Art was a sin. Drawing a whole human that, if given the soul, could live, was a form of competing with God, and that I'd be punished for eternity for doing so.
It seemed so wrong, like what on earth??? Why would an all merciful God be mad with me for something I never intended to do??? I always drew as a way of admiring God's creation, to release the creativity I had in my chest, and I was told that God doesn't punish someone for their actions, but their intentions! Something certainly did *not* add up here.

Day after day, I had intrusive thoughts that kept telling me something was wrong, and the Muslim God couldn't make up his mind on what he wants to do. I was so confused.

So to cut it short, a month ago, Alex told me a sentence that made my mind go extremely uneasy.
""Maybe, Deedeee, maybe God had made this friendship, so that you could find the right path."" Said Alex.
I remember that night, I woke up at exactly 2AM to the craziest thought ever.
The thought was basically like this:
I travel to Alex's country for college, and they invite me over for Thanksgiving, as it is a national holiday in that country, and during that, I tell them I have an amazing surprise for the entire family. They all look at me curiously and then I take off my veil and my jacket, and underneath them is a shirt that says ""Proud Christian""
I remember I found my limbs cold and my heart racing at the thought, and I couldn't help but hide under the blankets, what was that crazy thought?!!? What was happening???

As the night went on, I found myself reaching for my phone, and opening up reddit. For no reason at all I started looking up stories of converts to try and see why Muslims convert to Christianity, and it was then that every. Word. I. Have. Ever. Heard. About. Islam. Was revealed to be wrong.

3 days ago, after finding enough proof, I had decided. It was time I leave this dumb religion and find myself another. Only Christianity is the one that ever came to my mind. And so I decided. If Jesus was real, he would answer my prayers.
I kept thinking about a rational prayer to ask for, until it came to me! If I experience a headache, surely Jesus can stop the pain, right? It's just a simple headache!
And so I hide under a blanket again, and say three times. ""Jesus, please take away the pain in my head, it hurts so much and I can not stand it. Please."" 
And after the third time, I raise my head a little and look around the room. One thought in my mind. ""That actually worked.""
It was basically the breaking point for me, and so, I decided, I was going to please the God that had saved me from the horrible religion Islam is, and read the entire Bible. I will please Him. 

I started asking Alex around some questions, Hey Alex! How do you pray? Hey Alex! Where do you read the Bible online! Hey Alex! Hey Alex! And so on

Sadly after a while, Alex who didn't know I converted, became very upset, and it was their right, because they thought I didn't believe in the Bible. They thought we wouldn't end up in the same place after we pass away, and that thought made them sick to the stomach.

However, on April 25th, I found myself opening reddit again, and creating a new anonymous account to have all my questions asked, and so I asked Reddit.
SHOULD I TELL ALEX THAT IM CHRISTIAN, OH DEAR REDDIT?
Of course, the answer was yes and I kept dying to see Alex that day until finally, they FINALLY woke up.

So immediately I was like ALEX ALEX ALEX COME TO THE VIDEO CHAT I NEED TO SEE YOUR REACTION TO THIS THING IM ABOUT TO TELL YOU!!!!
Alex was like wha-
And I yelled at them until finally they entered the video chat, and I was laughing so much at them, because as best friends, they kept making fun of me because I kept jumping around in excitement, so here I quote to you what I said, what I saw, and what they replied to me.
""I believe Jesus is the son of God.""
A long pause is seen on Alex's face, and I believe they thought I was pranking them, so they replied.
""What."" 
I see their face come closer to the screen.
""You read it.""
They put their hand on their mouth for a minute.
""You do?""
""Yes. I have been reading the Bible, and asking you all those questions because I had no idea how to be a Christian.""
The next thing I saw, was Alex's face turning red and them rubbing their eyes, because they were so full of tears.
What the heck, no, Alex never cries, I KNOW ALEX, THEY DONT CRY!! DID I BREAK THE SYSTEM???
For the next half an hour, Alex was unable to stop crying, and they had a right, because I was shooting them with the most wholesome talk ever.

Ever since then, Alex and I found ourselves so close to each other. It was like Jesus embraced us both, and made us as close as we are now.

I have been praying to Jesus for a while now, and only his power was able to answer those prayers, and make me feel as amazing as I do now.

I might add to this more in the future, but for now I have a simple request for anyone who read all of this:
Ppease pray for me to be protected from Satan's lies, and from my family. Remember me in your prayers because I need to get out of here one way or the other, so pray that Jesus makes it easy on both me and my family to accept the fact that I just do not believe what they believe in.

God bless you all, thank you for reading this far! I love all of you in Jesus :)

TL;DR: Even as a small kid, I believe Jesus had planted a seed of curiosity in my heart towards Christianity, and with his beautiful plan for me, he guided me all the way to his one true religion through fixing up my personality first, then showing me the faith. And he used one beautiful human being for that, Alex.

Alex and I were so close, it was almost as though we were two sisters separated by a world. But that never stopped us from being close.

Accidents happened and for a short while, me and Alex weren't as close, but it felt so wrong, life felt so empty without them, and for that reason, I decided it's time to fix up what has been broken. I was going to fix my friendship with them. No matter the cost.

Month after month, Alex started growing a better relationship with me through a common hobby, art. We both enjoyed drawing so much, and with her help, I developed the talent I adored and was able to draw as much as I dared!

A year later, we decided to step up our game, and strengthen our friendship more through something common as well, and that's when we both started writing several stories together.

I was very happy talking to Alex about things we both loved, making up stories was our passion, and it only kept improving by the minute!!

then in August-September, I came across something that broke my heart to a million pieces. It destroyed a huge portion of the happiness Ive built up for years. I discovered that for Muslims, Art was a sin. Drawing a whole human that, if given the soul, could live, was a form of competing with God, and that I'd be punished for eternity for doing so.
It seemed so wrong, like what on earth??? Why would an all merciful God be mad with me for something I never intended to do??? I always drew as a way of admiring God's creation, to release the creativity I had in my chest, and I was told that God doesn't punish someone for their actions, but their intentions! Something certainly did *not* add up here.

Day after day, I had intrusive thoughts that kept telling me something was wrong, and the Muslim God couldn't make up his mind on what he wants to do. I was so confused.

So to cut it short, a month ago, Alex told me a sentence that made my mind go extremely uneasy.
""Maybe, Deedeee, maybe God had made this friendship, so that you could find the right path."" Said Alex.
I remember that night, I woke up at exactly 2AM to the craziest thought ever.
The thought was basically like this:
I travel to Alex's country for college, and they invite me over for Thanksgiving, as it is a national holiday in that country, and during that, I tell them I have an amazing surprise for the entire family. They all look at me curiously and then I take off my veil and my jacket, and underneath them is a shirt that says ""Proud Christian""
I remember I found my limbs cold and my heart racing at the thought, and I couldn't help but hide under the blankets, what was that crazy thought?!!? What was happening???

As the night went on, I found myself reaching for my phone, and opening up reddit. For no reason at all I started looking up stories of converts to try and see why Muslims convert to Christianity, and it was then that every. Word. I. Have. Ever. Heard. About. Islam. Was revealed to be wrong.

3 days ago, after finding enough proof, I had decided. It was time I leave this dumb religion and find myself another. Only Christianity is the one that ever came to my mind. And so I decided. If Jesus was real, he would answer my prayers.
I kept thinking about a rational prayer to ask for, until it came to me! If I experience a headache, surely Jesus can stop the pain, right? It's just a simple headache!
And so I hide under a blanket again, and say three times. ""Jesus, please take away the pain in my head, it hurts so much and I can not stand it. Please."" 
And after the third time, I raise my head a little and look around the room. One thought in my mind. ""That actually worked.""
It was basically the breaking point for me, and so, I decided, I was going to please the God that had saved me from the horrible religion Islam is, and read the entire Bible. I will please Him. 

I started asking Alex around some questions, Hey Alex! How do you pray? Hey Alex! Where do you read the Bible online! Hey Alex! Hey Alex! And so on

Sadly after a while, Alex who didn't know I converted, became very upset, and it was their right, because they thought I didn't believe in the Bible. They thought we wouldn't end up in the same place after we pass away, and that thought made them sick to the stomach.

However, on April 25th, I found myself opening reddit again, and creating a new anonymous account to have all my questions asked, and so I asked Reddit.
SHOULD I TELL ALEX THAT IM CHRISTIAN, OH DEAR REDDIT?
Of course, the answer was yes and I kept dying to see Alex that day until finally, they FINALLY woke up.

So immediately I was like ALEX ALEX ALEX COME TO THE VIDEO CHAT I NEED TO SEE YOUR REACTION TO THIS THING IM ABOUT TO TELL YOU!!!!
Alex was like wha-
And I yelled at them until finally they entered the video chat, and I was laughing so much at them, because as best friends, they kept making fun of me because I kept jumping around in excitement, so here I quote to you what I said, what I saw, and what they replied to me.
""I believe Jesus is the son of God.""
A long pause is seen on Alex's face, and I believe they thought I was pranking them, so they replied.
""What."" 
I see their face come closer to the screen.
""You read it.""
They put their hand on their mouth for a minute.
""You do?""
""Yes. I have been reading the Bible, and asking you all those questions because I had no idea how to be a Christian.""
The next thing I saw, was Alex's face turning red and them rubbing their eyes, because they were so full of tears.
What the heck, no, Alex never cries, I KNOW ALEX, THEY DONT CRY!! DID I BREAK THE SYSTEM???
For the next half an hour, Alex was unable to stop crying, and they had a right, because I was shooting them with the most wholesome talk ever.

Ever since then, Alex and I found ourselves so close to each other. It was like Jesus embraced us both, and made us as close as we are now.

I have been praying to Jesus for a while now, and only his power was able to answer those prayers, and make me feel as amazing as I do now.

I might add to this more in the future, but for now I have a simple request for anyone who read all of this:
Ppease pray for me to be protected from Satan's lies, and from my family. Remember me in your prayers because I need to get out of here one way or the other, so pray that Jesus makes it easy on both me and my family to accept the fact that I just do not believe what they believe in.

God bless you all, thank you for reading this far! I love all of you in Jesus :)

TL;DR: Even as a small kid, I believe Jesus had planted a seed of curiosity in my heart towards Christianity, and with his beautiful plan for me, he guided me all the way to his one true religion through fixing up my personality first, then showing me the faith. And he used one beautiful human being for that, Alex.
It's been a beautiful and blessed month, and as you guys had suggested, I told Alex that I converted, and we both have felt closer than ever before :D",first month christian really happen month ago

2nd Edit: for all you habitual porn users: porn is so addictive that it can cause ED and other performance issues when it comes to intimacy with a partner. Just some food for thought. 

Edit: *WOW thank you all for the overwhelming support and encouragement. I never expected such a positive response to this post. I am praying for everyone struggling and serious about getting right with God! Porn is a drug, and a serious addiction. It is possible to quit for good!*


ORIGINAL POST
I just want to encourage anyone out there struggling with porn addiction. My husband and I both used porn habitually, a long time before we met, and then still after we married. We both started feeling sick about using other people in that manner. I could see when the actors/cam people were bored, sad, unhappy, not into it, disgusted etc. It was taking a toll on us each as individuals, and we talked about it. I was super convicted, especially after learning lots more about the porn industry AND having read through the bible several times. 


Understanding marriage through the bible opened my eyes and gave me a new reverence for God and his plan for marriage. It made me fall completely in love with my husband, all over again. My attitude improved. My eyes stopped wandering so much. I no longer desired porn. 


Since we both decided to purposely avoid giving in to that sin addiction (idol before the Lord, honestly), our marriage has gotten better than ever in many ways. God blesses obedience. Marriage is the earthly metaphor for Christ's love for the church. We are not to worship other gods. We are not to gratify our appetites with images of those we are not married to. 


I'm not telling anyone what to do. Just want to encourage those who struggle with this sin and would like to quit some day. Repentance and change take a lot of work and faith. Immerse your heart and mind with the word of God. It will change your life for the better. Thanks for reading, if you got this far.

MFButtercup,0.0,656.0,"Hey guys, basically this post is just what it says in the title, all three of these preconceptions were primarily challenged by one particular Christian friend of mine, so here they are:

**One, that the trinity and tawheed are not equivalent in apologetics.** For a lot of Muslims, the idea that God is one, and that this is intuitive, is a huge strength for Islam. As such, we expect the reverse to be true for Christians, so when Christians aren't able to offer a defence of the trinity that strikes us as equally intuitive to tawheed, we are confused why Christians would believe this thing.

It wasn't until my Christian friend very candidly said, ""Of course the idea that God is one essence and one person is more intuitive than him being one essence and three persons. Christians don't argue for the truth of Christianity based on how obviously intuitive the trinity is; it's just not something that overrides all other arguments in the way it does for Muslims."" That I realised judging the trinity as if I should expect it to be equivalent to tawheed was silly.

**Two, that preservation of scripture from corruption doesn't have to mean keeping every word exactly the same.** This is a very big one, but as a Muslim I expected the changes to the text to be this huge source of embarrassment for Christians. It was very surprising to me when my Christian friend very casually said at one point when we were talking about the Bible, ""Of course, we probably don't have any of the original words of Moses in the Torah."" And I was shocked and just said, ""Well then why do you believe it?"" And he stared sort of blankly at me and was just like, ""Because whether or not it's the words of Moses doesn't preclude it being the word of God.""

For most Muslims the Quran is the exact words of God written in Arabic. In fact, the fact the Quran is Arabic is really important. The idea that for many Christians the Bible is understood as being in English and the original greek/hebrew is really just considered a useful study tool is very strange for Muslims. However, when I understood that actually the Christian understanding of the Bible is about a much more transcendent involvement of God in preserving the text, it really changed my view.

**Three, that Christianity has been subject to way more academic scrutiny.** A lot of Muslims get very excited about all the scrutiny that Christianity has been subject to. As already mentioned, we expect the different versions of old manuscripts to be a really huge issue for Christians. However, it was really interesting to me when my friend basically explained that Christianity has been subject to serious academic scrutiny since the 1800s, where people were seriously questioning it historical reliability. My friend even pointed out that it used to be far more acceptable to question the historicity of Jesus himself in academic circles, whereas now such a view would be seen as totally fringe. 

As my friend put it, ""Christianity is not being subject to *mounting* historical and textual criticism. It's actually made it through the worst of it quite comfortably when you look at the history of Biblical scholarship."" He then went onto explain that Islam is currently facing mounting historical and textual criticism. As a Muslim I was taught that Islam had always been subject to these challenges from ""Islamophobes"". However, when I actually looked at the real history of academic criticism of Islam... it really has just been growing and growing, and there are criticisms being made now which weren't even on the radar a few decades ago. That is something that most Muslims don't take into account where comparing how comfortable they are with Islam compared to Christianity. 

With Christianity you pretty much have all of it laid out before you: including the many criticisms. In the case of Islam, the criticism is really just beginning and it's hard to know where it will end. It sort of shows that Muslims really aren't in a position to be bringing the full weight of academic scholarship against Christianity while ignoring the growing tide against their own faith.

And there we go... those are three things that I wish I could have understood as a Muslim sooner, because once I understood these things it was basically undeniable that I'd become a Christian.",1,Three preconceptions I had as a Muslim that prevented me from becoming a Christian,656.0,0.98,"Three preconceptions I had as a Muslim that prevented me from becoming a Christian Hey guys, basically this post is just what it says in the title, all three of these preconceptions were primarily challenged by one particular Christian friend of mine, so here they are:

yuhyuhyuh32,0.0,643.0,"I was recently in a discussion with a distressed Christian man online in the comments of a Youtube video critiquing Creationists. This guy explained that he rejects evolution because he feels that otherwise life would have no purpose and we are simply the product of chance and mistakes. He said that all of the bad things that have happened to him and his resolve would ultimately be futile if he believed in evolution.

I shared with him that I am a believing Catholic with a degree in biology who feels that belief in God and evolution are not mutually exclusive. The existence of one does not negate the existence of the other. I explained to him that DNA mutations drive evolution through natural selection (for those unfamiliar with evolution, this is 'survival of the fittest'). DNA mutations arise from 'mistakes' in our cells' replication processes, and over enormous amounts of time has led to the various organisms around us today, and also those now extinct. My explanation for why evolution and belief in God are not mutually exclusive is that these mistakes in DNA happen by chance without an underlying purpose. I like to think that God has had a hand in carrying out those mistakes. I know some people might find that silly, but it makes sense to me.

I wanted to share my thoughts because I truly believe all people should view science with an open mind, and people (especially the religious) should not feel that certain topics in science directly oppose faith. If anyone here has found themselves in a similar position as the guy I was talking to, please try to be receptive to these ideas and even do your own research into evolution. It is an incredibly interesting field and we are always learning new information about our and all of life's origins.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer any questions and have polite discussion. For example, I can explain some experiences that show evolution in progress in a laboratory setting.

I'm not sure if this has been discussed on this sub, as I'm not really active on reddit and sort of made this post on a whim.

EDIT: I thought this would be obvious and implied, but of course this is not a factual assertion or claim. There's no harm in hearing different perspectives to help form your own that you are comfortable with, especially if it helps you accept two ideas that maybe have clashed in your life. Yes, there's no evidence for this and never will be. This will never be proven but it will also never be disproved.

I am absolutely heartbroken, as this pastor was not only a mentor but someone I consider a very dear friend. He was instrumental in my conversion from atheism to Christianity, and incredibly supportive of my goal to attend seminary.

For context, we are a small parish (only about 15-20 regular attendees every Sunday) of mostly elderly white people in a Blue state in the Northeast of the US. But my town is heavily conservative (I'm a conservative myself, but I think what happened to my pastor is disgusting). There are no minorities in the parish, except for the organist who is Korean.

They told my pastor that if he continued to speak out about racism in society, and how we in a mostly-white town (especially as Christians) cannot just tune this issue out, he would be fired. He courageously said he would not be silent, as it is his duty as a follower of Christ and a pastor.

Islam and Christianity are the most similar religions in the world. Its a shame whats happening currently. Islam doesn't teach such acts of violence. Infact churches are meant to be respected in islam. And the attacker in Avignon wasn't muslim by any means basing on some news outlets. I hope we dont fall apart and come out of this as better and more tolerant towards each other

Here's an example. A testament of Muhammad on Saint Catherine's Monastery back then when Islam had vastly expanded in power.

English translation of the¬†Ashtiname¬†by Anton F. Haddad

This is a letter which was issued by Mohammed, Ibn Abdullah, the Messenger, the Prophet, the Faithful, who is sent to all the people as a trust on the part of God to all His creatures, that they may have no plea against God hereafter. Verily God is Omnipotent, the Wise. This letter is directed to the embracers of Islam, as a covenant given to the followers of Jesus the Nazarene in the East and West, the far and near, the Arabs and foreigners, the known and the unknown.

This letter contains the oath given unto them, and he who disobeys that which is therein will be considered a disbeliever and a transgressor to that whereunto he is commanded. He will be regarded as one who has corrupted the oath of God, disbelieved His Testament, rejected His Authority, despised His Religion, and made himself deserving of His Curse, whether he is a Sultan or any other believer of Islam.

I shall exempt them from that which may disturb them; of the burdens which are paid by others as an oath of allegiance.

No one is allowed to plunder these Christians, or destroy or spoil any of their churches, or houses of worship, or take any of the things contained within these houses and bring it to the houses of Islam. And he who takes away anything therefrom, will be one who has corrupted the oath of God, and, in truth, disobeyed His Messenger.

Jizya¬†should not be put upon their judges, monks, and those whose occupation is the worship of God; nor is any other thing to be taken from them, whether it be a fine, a tax or any unjust right.

No taxes or tithes should be received from those who devote themselves to the worship of God in the mountains, or from those who cultivate the Holy Lands. No one has the right to interfere with their affairs, or bring any action against them. Verily this is for aught else and not for them; rather, in the seasons of crops, they should be given a Kadah for each Ardab of wheat (about five bushels and a half) as provision for them, and no one has the right to say to them 'this is too much', or ask them to pay any tax.
As to those who possess properties, the wealthy and merchants, the poll-tax to be taken from them must not exceed twelve drachmas a head per year (i.e. about 200 modern day US dollars).

They shall not be imposed upon by anyone to undertake a journey, or to be forced to go to wars or to carry arms; for the Muslims have to fight for them.

Edit 3: I didn't come here to debate, please i dont want this post to be about back and forth arguments.

Islam and Christianity are the most similar religions in the world. Its a shame whats happening currently. Islam doesn't teach such acts of violence. Infact churches are meant to be respected in islam. And the attacker in Avignon wasn't muslim by any means basing on some news outlets. I hope we dont fall apart and come out of this as better and more tolerant towards each other

Here's an example. A testament of Muhammad on Saint Catherine's Monastery back then when Islam had vastly expanded in power.

English translation of the¬†Ashtiname¬†by Anton F. Haddad

This is a letter which was issued by Mohammed, Ibn Abdullah, the Messenger, the Prophet, the Faithful, who is sent to all the people as a trust on the part of God to all His creatures, that they may have no plea against God hereafter. Verily God is Omnipotent, the Wise. This letter is directed to the embracers of Islam, as a covenant given to the followers of Jesus the Nazarene in the East and West, the far and near, the Arabs and foreigners, the known and the unknown.

This letter contains the oath given unto them, and he who disobeys that which is therein will be considered a disbeliever and a transgressor to that whereunto he is commanded. He will be regarded as one who has corrupted the oath of God, disbelieved His Testament, rejected His Authority, despised His Religion, and made himself deserving of His Curse, whether he is a Sultan or any other believer of Islam. Whenever Christian monks, devotees and pilgrims gather together, whether in a mountain or valley, or den, or frequented place, or plain, or church, or in houses of worship, verily we are [at the] back of them and shall protect them, and their properties and their morals, by Myself, by My Friends and by My Assistants, for they are of My Subjects and under My Protection.

souptastesgood11,0.0,597.0,"I've always been a believer and I've always prayed. Lately I've been asking Jesus to show me my convictions and to guide me on the right path.

3 years ago I was convicted of having sex before marriage and I was so broken. I knew I'd be with this guy forever so I prayed and prayed and thank you God this man asked me to marry him and we got married the next summer and I repented heavily for my wicked ways. But I still had sin..
 
I've been smoking weed for over 10 years. I was convicted a few weeks ago so I only smoked at night and as little as possible.

Well last week I had enough. I was convicted and God asked me why weed is so important. I couldn't find an answer!! It set me free.

It's only been 5 days... But I remembered as a teenager I fell into alcohol and I quit cold turkey a year later when I felt convicted of my use of alcohol. I can be around alcohol now and not even care about it.

So I figured, if I can quit alcohol and not even care about it ever again, I can quit weed and never care about it again.

God, Jesus and the holy spirit is so much more important than a little bit of weed every night.

All it did for me was change my mindset. It made me pray harder, it made me think harder. But it still didn't make me sober which is what God wants.

I think my eternal life is more important than my temporary life here. I want to do everything I can to make my eternal life a good one in heaven.

I want to turn from all my sins and wicked ways.

I am so thankful for this journey. I do wish I didn't do the things I did. But thank you God for sending us Jesus because wow I couldn't do it without him.

I still have sins to work with. Such as gossip. Everytime I'm at work people will talk to me about other people!! I have been gossiping and I am convicted of that too! As soon as I do it I repent. So I guess that's the first step is noticing the problem.

In this situation, Jesus isn't demanding that you go to a building for an hour or two. Services can wait, and there are online services if what you're doing at home isn't sufficient for you.

Jesus told us to treat others as we want to be treated. If you don't want people risking your life, then don't risk the life of others.

Jesus told us to love people, even our enemies. You are NOT loving others by exposing them to this virus.

Having to miss a few services is NOT taking away your right to freedom of religion. But if Christianity get associated with people who do these kinds of STUPID and RECKLESS things, it will be bad for all of us for a long time.

In this situation, Jesus isn't demanding that you go to a building for an hour or two. Services can wait, and there are online services if what you're doing at home isn't sufficient for you.

Jesus told us to treat others as we want to be treated. If you don't want people risking your life, then don't risk the life of others.

Jesus told us to love people, even our enemies. You are NOT loving others by exposing them to this virus.

Having to miss a few services is NOT taking away your right to freedom of religion. But if Christianity get associated with people who do these kinds of STUPID and RECKLESS things, it will be bad for all of us for a long time.

Stop and Think!

Easter will no less important if we're observing it in June or July. That's what my church will end up doing. 

So stay at home. Read the scriptures, pray, read the Church Fathers, watch online options if you're so inclined. But do NOT gather for services and risk not only our own health but everyone you will go out and be in contact with.

They act as if they are the only ones who can hear God, and when you hear something against the status quo you have missed it to and need to get back in Gods will.

She deserves a heaven. Since this is the internet and privacy is important, her nickname from a young family member was lil mimo if you‚Äôre looking for a name to pray for. Thank you so much for reading this and for any prayers or positive thoughts sent her way.

Edit: thank you all for the support. Your prayers and words of encouragement mean so much.

Edit 2: After a second opinion, my mother is officially being taken off of life support. It‚Äôs so hard to comprehend because I can see her and touch her and she‚Äôs alive and my mom but she‚Äôs not there at the same time and hasn‚Äôt been there. But now, she will actually pass on. I‚Äôm hopeful that she gets to go to her heaven and have an afterlife since this one was cut so short. Thank you for all the prayers and support. It meant a lot and really helped me. I wish it could have brought her back to us.

Edit 3: 1 week since she passed and we harvested her honey (she was a beekeeper) for the final time w/o her. I feel she was with us in spirit and her being a beekeeper was a real gift because honey doesn‚Äôt expire (if kept stored well and secure) so I can keep a jar of it and some that she actually jarred herself from previous seasons and partake in it years or decades from now and think of her.",mom take life support soon could use prayer mom love positive wise person know excite help raise 4 week old daughter way raise lot love base suffer cardiac arrest damage brain beyond repair told likely happen try accept despite ridiculously unfair lose family without believe strongly prayer heaven want believe ever want ask internet stranger please pray deserves heaven since internet privacy important nickname young family member lil mimo look name pray thank much reading prayer positive thought sent way edit thank support prayer word encouragement mean much edit 2 second opinion mother officially take life support hard comprehend see touch alive mom time actually pas hopeful get go heaven afterlife since one cut short thank prayer support meant lot really help wish could brought back u edit 3 1 week since pass harvest honey beekeeper final time w feel u spirit beekeeper real gift honey expire kept store well secure keep jar actually jarred previous season partake year decade think

Why am I letting the thoughts that others instilled in me hold me back if there are so many other people telling me, showing me that it works. 

And that moment, when I was able to break free, i felt the urge to pray. So, I prayed, and I waited to feel something. But I felt nothing, so I prayed again. And again, nothing.

WuhLuh,0.0,535.0,"My dog was recently diagnosed with an aortic blood clot. She was prescribed blood thinners, and my family can't afford the $10,000 surgery. The vet said that her future isn't looking bright, but she would keep my dog in her prayers and tell her prayer group as well.

For some brief background; when I was a little boy, I would make the same birthday wish every single year. I wanted my stuffed animal dog to turn into a real dog. I always wanted a real dog. It finally came to be years later toward the end of my adolescence. My family adopted an amazing, cartoonishly cute puppy from animal shelter. In the beginning we knew her as the devil dog due to her biting at our toes and being an erupting volcano of energy. Overtime she grew more calm and relaxed, and became my absolute best friend. Her name is Cecelia. Today she is 9 years and 1 month old.

The vet and staff love her so much they were actually crying when they found out what was going on with her. I really love this dog, man. I grew into myself with her, she watched me change so dramatically over the years, it's absolutely devastating to my family and I. She got home from the vet today, and we're supposed to do to a follow up 1 week from now.

During my prayers, I've come to the realization that perhaps my dog's mission has been completed, in a sense. Perhaps, my little girlie was sent here to help me change, I cannot express enough how much she has offered me in support. I'm a grown man now, with goals and ambition, something I've always lacked. At the end of the day, it's God's decision as to what will happen with her. I know it's selfish, but I want her to stay around for a lot longer, I want her to be able to go on long walks again, and enjoy her favorite trail, and love the life that my family and I offer her. I don't want her to suffer either. Part of me thinks, that if God wants her to return to Him, then who am I to oppose? Though at the same time, I selfishly want to still experience life with my little buddy by my side.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post, God bless you all, thank you for keeping my beloved little friend in your prayers.

sickandtired679x4s,0.0,532.0,"I volunteered yesterday and I was talking to one of the other volunteers about how I was thinking of getting a pet bird.

This morning I woke up very very early and I was in the mood for cinnamon raisin bread but I had no eggs so I decided I would go to the store and get some bagels and eggs.
I got to the grocery store and there was a bird with a bruised up wing at the entrance.

I asked for some paper towels and took the bird home and fed it some bird seeds and water and some raisin bread I let it heal and read the Bible to it and then went to church.

When I got home I called the animal rescue to see if they would be able to take him in in case his wing was completely broken. 
I prayed and asked God to please don't let the bird be afraid of me and to please heal the bird. 
As I got the basket where the bird was into my car and was getting ready to go to the wildlife rescue the bird popped out of the basket and started flying around my car.

I opened all the doors to my car and it flew off.

For half a day I got to have a bird as a pet thanks be to God almighty.

90bronco,0.0,524.0,"I've seen a lot of back and forth on social media about the government ordering churches to close. The people arguing churches should stay open seem to give 2 arguments, which may have some validity, but miss the forest for the trees.

The first argument I hear is the government is overstepping its bounds ordering churches to close. While the reason they give for this belief varies, I think it is a flawed outlook because it focuses on the relationship between the (little c) church, the government and specifically how this affects them and their rights. How can we call ourselves Christians when we are more worried about our rights and freedoms when Philippians 2, calls us to value the interest of others above ourselves. We can not.  Christians can not concern ourselves with a temporary ban on meetings, not on our faith, when we are contributing to the spread of Covid to those who may suffer and/or die from it. 


The 2nd argument I see is the one in where people claim that God will protect them, or that if its Gods will, they will catch the disease regardless. Whether you agree with this or not, the attitude denies the love He has for non-believers. Worse, it could be sinful pride by choosing to focus on how God's love benefits them only, and ignoring the call to ministry by loving others. 

Are we sinning by not attending services in the building? Not with all the other options available to us. But we could be by choosing actions that could lead others to harm and death.

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a grocery store, 3rd shift, and I was pretty upset at some silly co-worker stuff. I ended up going off out loud (not at anyone) about the whole thing and went to sit outside. I normally never do that, but with the panic and fear I see around me about the COVID virus, I just snapped. I was crying on a bench outside talking with God about my actions, about how I never get anything right and I don't feel anyone listens to me at my job, along with some other things I can't remember. Not even a minute later, up walks this man with a cart (who I assumed was homeless, and I was correct). 

He sat down on this table next to me and started talking to me. He had a cross around his neck, and he said he was a believer of the gospel and of God. He shared with me how he was homeless and he was outside all night. He told me that he wasn't worried too much, as some ladies he knew had given him a thick blanket and a new pillow to sleep on. He said he had clean clothes too in his cart, but he couldn't find a place to shower just yet. He then said that he spends his nights picking up trash around town, because he wants to do what he can for God. He was telling me how he found a dinner still wrapped up in a plastic bag from KFC, and in his words ""It's like it just came out of the oven! God knew what I needed"". 

As I write this, I can't help but feel humbled. I didn't sleep outside, nor do I find random meals like that, I have plenty at home, in my warm house. God wanted to reach me through this man, and we prayed together that God would comfort those suffering from the virus and that we Christians can be supportive to those in need and that we could spread the love and peace of God to the world, because now is a critical time for Christians to represent God truthfully and lovingly. He is so good, and he loves you all so much. If this was encouragement, then that's amazing! If this helped you refocus too, then He blessed us both. If this makes you think about God differently, and possibly in a new light, don't sit on that feeling, let it take you and run with it back to God.

ApologeticKid,0.0,486.0,"Hey people, just an update on this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/kvc6j9/my\_grandfather\_is\_1\_month\_away\_from\_his\_100th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/kvc6j9/my_grandfather_is_1_month_away_from_his_100th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

My grandpa made it to last night and then passed away. My family is very sad, but he was old and we expected it for a while. We're just bummed that he made it so close to his goal of 100 and didn't quite reach it. Still, 99.9 years is a good long time.

My grandfather was a man of unusual faith. He was technically an atheist, but was a die-hard Baptist. When pressed on questions of God, he would tell you that he thought that ""God"" was just an idea that we can gather around as people. He didn't believe in anything after death, and told me that Jesus was a good moral teacher, but nothing else. He occasionally offered me books by Ehrman or Borg to read. Nevertheless, he remained faithful to his local (very theologically liberal) Baptist church. Towards the end, one of his caregivers reported to our family that they had found him on the floor and had approached him with concern, only to find that he was, in fact, on his knees in prayer. I don't know what that means, if anything. But it tells me that perhaps there was more to his beliefs than he conveyed to me.

Anyways, we're going to miss him. Thank you for your support and prayers. If you are so inclined, please do pray for my family as we navigate grief in pandemic-land. Not sure how to mourn when all of the traditional avenues are unsafe and unavailable at present.

AgentSmithRadio,0.0,464.0,"On Monday, June 1, Americans and people around the world witnessed the events at [Lafayette Square and St. John's Episcopal Church](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-washingtondc/on-the-streets-of-washington-pleas-for-change-met-with-batons-and-rubber-bullets-idUSKBN2392VX). During the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd and police brutality, President Donald Trump and people within his administration ordered and orchestrated the clearing of the area through the use of federal officers before curfew. In the wake of this event, we saw a church property  cleared and Christian protesters cracked down on. This includes the pastor of that church, and at least one member of this subreddit.

News of this event spread fast, and it's still making headlines four days later. A lot of lies and deflections and uncertainties have been told around this news story, but at the heart of it all, it was all for a photo op and a campaign video for the Trump administration. People are still actively enraged by these events.

This story has seen a wave of users on this subreddit, new and old, who are attempting to deflect and muck this story, and others like it. It's not like there's been a shortage of news events in the last few years. It's reminiscent of when mass shootings occur and when the topic of gun control is brought up you'll see a wave of comments saying, ""it's too soon to discuss it."" 

There's a multitude of reasons and motivations for why people do this, from favouring the status quo, to supporting their political party, to not wanting to see what they don't like, down to active concern trolling and tone policing to distract their political opposition.

There's been several lines of arguments going around in defense of Donald Trump and the events at Lafayette Square. When a church and Christians are attacked by federal agents for a photo op, it's important to root these out and examine these arguments to understand where we collectively stand.

**Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged**

Matthew 7:1(NIV)
&gt; **Judging Others**

&gt; 7 ‚ÄúDo not judge, or you too will be judged.

Ignore for a second that this teaching continues onward: Matthew 7:2-5 (NIV)
&gt;  2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
&gt; 3 ‚ÄúWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother‚Äôs eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, ‚ÄòLet me take the speck out of your eye,‚Äô when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother‚Äôs eye.

[I may have ranted about this earlier this week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/gv0d5w/matthew_715_beware_of_false_prophets_which_come/fsmvq5s/)
If you don't want to read or re-read the above link, there are three fundamental issues with this approach to completely avoiding political criticism.

1. It ignores every single instance a Prophet or Apostle has judged. This ignores Galatians 2, 1 Corinthians 5, every single OT Prophet, 2 Corinthians and the ""super Apostles"", and a billion other references within the Bible itself where a righteous person judges.

2. Without judgement, there is no ability to ask for justice. Justice is a primary petition we pray for from God, and without judgement, one can not determine what is wrong.

3. The 4 verses after verse 1. The teaching has always been about judging hypocritically, and you can tell because that's exactly the language that was used here.

**God Appointed Trump As An Authority And We Should Not Question Him**

Romans 13:1-7 (NIV)

&gt; **Submission to Governing Authorities**

&gt; 13 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God‚Äôs servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God‚Äôs servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

&gt; 6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God‚Äôs servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

Also: 1 Peter 2:13-17 (NIV)

&gt; 13 Submit yourselves for the Lord‚Äôs sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 14 or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 15 For it is God‚Äôs will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 16 Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God‚Äôs slaves. 17 Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.

This is a benefit that a lot of world leaders don't get, but this one has been rearing its head in this administration ever since Jeff Sessions used Romans 13 to justify the methods of detainment at ICE facilities.

This argument makes three fundamental mistakes. The first mistake is that Americans don't live under a monarchy or an empire, they live in a democracy (a republic if you want to get truly pedantic). Freedom of speech and criticism of the government are expected parts of American living, which are enshrined in their constitution, and are considered important, if not essential, aspects of civic participation. They aren't doing wrong by saying things, or by protesting peacefully, because they aren't breaking the law. These arguments simply do not apply to these people, including those posting on this subreddit.

The second mistake is that leaders, chosen by God or otherwise, still do terrible things. The first King of Israel, Saul, was delegitimized for his actions and descended into extreme paranoia and did many evil acts. The next King, David, a man after God's own heart and possibly the most beloved King of Israel, famously had sex with his general's wife and then had his general put on a suicide mission  to cover up the deed. He only repented when a prophet called him out. Both chosen by God, both did terribly wrong things, both called out by Godly people.

The third mistake was that these passages have never been carte blanche for leaders doing bad things. Godwin's Law insists that I lose this argument, but I don't believe that anyone here in there right mind would disagree with the churches, priest and saints who opposed Hitler during his rise and during WW2. Certainly no Churches beyond 1000 members think that way. It begs the question as to where the threshold is, and honestly, it's been fairly low throughout the history of the Church. [Here's a 10 Minute Bible Hour on Romans 13 that explains the history of this passage and how it has been applied to governments.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Pl2jRaX4w&amp;t=2483s)

**Jesus Was Non-Political**

Ignoring that Jesus is God and we know the history of the Prophets, since those who make this argument will do that, Jesus was a political figure in his time and political events happened around him. Let's also ignore all of those teachings and times Jesus challenged people out of their norms that don't have modern political parallels, because ancient cultures are hard.

1. His procession into Jerusalem on a donkey was a potent subversion of the ""Return of the King"" trope.

2. His public act of flipping the tables of moneylenders at the Temple.

3. The arrest and execution of John the Baptist.

4. The constant plotting and debates with the Pharisees.

5. Render unto Ceasar that which is Ceasars. Render unto God that which is God's.

6. Christ was charged with blasphemy by the Sanhedrin, and later with sedition under Pontius Pilate in the Easter story.

7. Christ suffered a brutish poltical execution on the cross. 

If the writers of the Gospel didn't think these political issues and events were important, why did they write about them? Aren't they distracting from the good news of the ressurection? 
Shouldn't they be trying to become better Christians instead of criticizing the Pharisees? Why aren't they studying the scriptures instead of worrying about the one time Jesus flipped some tables over?

**God Doesn't Care About Politics**

He's high and mighty and appoints leaders anyways, so why should he care if leaders aren't perfect? He knows leaders can't be perfect but he chose the ones that can do their nations good, or to punish them for their sins (I've seen both used).

Yet God still condemned kings, rose prophets against kings, and had commentary on the political happenings of his subjects. Do you know the donkey verse that atheists like to cite jokingly from Ezekiel 23? That was a passage of God using Ezekiel to condemn Israel's alliances of all things. If God doesn't care, why did he bother to send the prophets?

The Old Testament is full of political discussion and condemnation of leaders and the actions of nations. These aren't new inventions of the Enlightenment or some nonsense, this is stuff that God did through the Prophets. We only get to see a fraction of it in this era, but this is one topic he most certainly wasn't silent on.

Or we could go to Prophets like Amos, who condemned the Northern Kingdom (Israel) on many grounds. He railed on the corrupt courts and the bribery in them, the removal of social programs (especially the practice of gleaning), the explicit taxation of the poor for the benefit of the rich, and a marginally religious society that cared more about wealth than actually following God's commands.

Or how about Habbakuk, a prophet who demanded justice on the Southern Kingdom (Judah) over violence, injustice, wrongdoing, destruction, a law incapable of doing anything and the evil perverting their justice system? His problem wasn't that God was going to respond to all of this (and he did), but that God was absolutely going to wreck Judah with the Babylonian Empire and wipe it out of existence on those grounds.

Or how about Jonah, a man who resisted the notion that God's grace could fall on Israel's enemies and eventually offered God's ultimatum of repentance for their evil society. And they did repent, at least for around 100 years before they recanted and beat Israel around.

The Bible's full of em', all voicing some very strongly worded statements against governments and leaders. Some of the prophets start with entire lists of condemnations for surrounding nations and over Israel. All of their words and condemnations came from God.

Feel free to link this if you see these arguments used in some way when discussing politics. I'm tired of the concern trolling and attempts at mucking conversations, and I refuse to see scripture misued for the sake of political gain. We're emboldened by hope, by faith and by love, not by lies. Let us move forward and be the light in the world Christ called us to be and not hide behind half-baked ideas that only apply to singular government administrations.",1,"""Why did this sub get so political?"" - Explained",464.0,0.88,"""Why did this sub get so political?"" - Explained On Monday, June 1, Americans and people around the world witnessed the events at [Lafayette Square and St. John's Episcopal Church](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-washingtondc/on-the-streets-of-washington-pleas-for-change-met-with-batons-and-rubber-bullets-idUSKBN2392VX). During the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd and police brutality, President Donald Trump and people within his administration ordered and orchestrated the clearing of the area through the use of federal officers before curfew. In the wake of this event, we saw a church property  cleared and Christian protesters cracked down on. This includes the pastor of that church, and at least one member of this subreddit.

News of this event spread fast, and it's still making headlines four days later. A lot of lies and deflections and uncertainties have been told around this news story, but at the heart of it all, it was all for a photo op and a campaign video for the Trump administration. People are still actively enraged by these events.

This story has seen a wave of users on this subreddit, new and old, who are attempting to deflect and muck this story, and others like it. It's not like there's been a shortage of news events in the last few years. It's reminiscent of when mass shootings occur and when the topic of gun control is brought up you'll see a wave of comments saying, ""it's too soon to discuss it."" 

There's a multitude of reasons and motivations for why people do this, from favouring the status quo, to supporting their political party, to not wanting to see what they don't like, down to active concern trolling and tone policing to distract their political opposition.

There's been several lines of arguments going around in defense of Donald Trump and the events at Lafayette Square. When a church and Christians are attacked by federal agents for a photo op, it's important to root these out and examine these arguments to understand where we collectively stand.

**Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged**

Matthew 7:1(NIV)
&gt; **Judging Others**

&gt; 7 ‚ÄúDo not judge, or you too will be judged.

Ignore for a second that this teaching continues onward: Matthew 7:2-5 (NIV)
&gt;  2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
&gt; 3 ‚ÄúWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother‚Äôs eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, ‚ÄòLet me take the speck out of your eye,‚Äô when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother‚Äôs eye.

[I may have ranted about this earlier this week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/gv0d5w/matthew_715_beware_of_false_prophets_which_come/fsmvq5s/)
If you don't want to read or re-read the above link, there are three fundamental issues with this approach to completely avoiding political criticism.

1. It ignores every single instance a Prophet or Apostle has judged. This ignores Galatians 2, 1 Corinthians 5, every single OT Prophet, 2 Corinthians and the ""super Apostles"", and a billion other references within the Bible itself where a righteous person judges.

2. Without judgement, there is no ability to ask for justice. Justice is a primary petition we pray for from God, and without judgement, one can not determine what is wrong.

3. The 4 verses after verse 1. The teaching has always been about judging hypocritically, and you can tell because that's exactly the language that was used here.

**God Appointed Trump As An Authority And We Should Not Question Him**

Romans 13:1-7 (NIV)

&gt; **Submission to Governing Authorities**

&gt; 13 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God‚Äôs servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God‚Äôs servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

&gt; 6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God‚Äôs servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

Also: 1 Peter 2:13-17 (NIV)

&gt; 13 Submit yourselves for the Lord‚Äôs sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 14 or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 15 For it is God‚Äôs will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 16 Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God‚Äôs slaves. 17 Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.

PsychoactiveWanderer,0.0,420.0,"Hi everyone. I felt called tonight to share a little bit of my story. I'm going to keep this one short, I will most certainly write up an account of my life that does more justice to the actual situation, but for now I want to give people hope and share this little testamony. 

I've had a pretty fucked up life. Filled with things that go far beyond the scope of this post. For most of my life I struggled with a crazy pornography and masturbation addiction. This lead me to extremely dark places (to say the least). This addiction nearly destroyed me.

I officially became a Christian about two months ago after hearing about Jesus from a friend at university. I'm 26 years old and have been crushed by this addiction for about 13-14 years. 

11 days ago I hit absolute rock bottom. I had taken drugs and watched pornography and was absolutely crushed. I felt the worst I have ever felt and just felt destroyed by my own nature. 

I was alone, in the dark, after a drug and porn binge. Absolutely depraved and guilty and confused and in pain. 

In that moment I fell to the floor and called out to God and Jesus the most powerfully and genuinely I have managed to pray before. I was almost in tears, pleading that these demons be lifted from me in the name of Jesus and through the power of the Holy Spirit. 

All of a sudden I heard the words 'He Alone is WORTHY'

Everything changed in that instant. Instead of crying about my own unworthiness I looked toward Jesus. A rush of life giving liberating energy coursed through my body. 

Ever since that day about 10 days ago my life has changed. I am no longer enslaved to my addictions. I am no longer enslaved to sin. Jesus saved me in my darkest most depraved hour. I am finally free.

I thought I was unsavable. I thought I had gone too far. When I was the most weak I had ever been Jesus chose to reveal His power. He told me that His power works best in weakness. It is true that His Grace is all we could ever need. 

I honestly can't explain what happened other than that right now. I'm a totally different person. Its miraculous and absolutely overwhelmingly incredible. Jesus Christ came into my dark, sinful depraved life and lifted me up out if my own nature. 

In an instant my dark human nature which I had lived with forever vanished off my back. My shoulders no longer felt the weight of the darkness of the enemy. 

Thank you Jesus. I will never forget this all my life. 

Every second is a gift from God our Creator when we are saved by Jesus!

elisabeth_cupwill,0.0,400.0,"I am 15 yo girl from the Czech Republic. I turned to Christ when i was 13 (january 2019) and I am the only one in my household and close family. I very rarely ask for things, but i would appreciate your prayers, kind people of reddit.

My family never kept me from my faith and going to church or mocked me, but they never truly supported (or took seriously) my believes either. I think they're like ""yeah, another phase, it will pass"" and don't take my opinion seriously when it comes to anything, for obvious reasons... I am just a kid for them.

One of the worst things is, that they can't see (and probably never will) the change God has made in me. They were blind to my struggles before i started to follow The Lord, and they are blind to how my life turned all around. I bet they would never think i ever considered suicide and now have tendency to cut.

I don't blame them tho. They didn't hurt me purposely, they always tried their best to raise me to a healthy woman.

The frustrating part i would like you to pray about, is that (espessialy during quarantine and holidays) i have no private place for praying. I live in a house, but it's a small one and I share room with older sis. There is no privacy, no knocking on doors in this house. I try to convince myself that i am not ashamed for my faith and wouldn't mind them running into me while praying, but lets be honest here - i just can't fully focus with them in the house and I don't want them to see me and possibly make some comment.

My faith is frequently dying out cuz of not enough prayer, my relationship with Lord is often non existent and it grieves me. And causes thoughts about hurting myself.

So please pray for my family and me - my prayer life, mental health, struggles with loneliness and complete emotional numbness.

Real-Wonder2501,0.0,374.0,"This might sound dumb. I was never brought up christian (I come from a very irreligious country), but did take some class in primary school that was about religion. We even went to a church one time and I remember finding everything about it very comforting and inviting. It felt very calming. I even used to pray to god at night when I was a still quite young because I had pretty bad night terrors and I found it comforting at the time. I eventually stopped though and I find ""intellectually"" or whatever less pretentious term one could use I still find it hard to believe.

I can't even say why I really want to go. I don't like just blurting out stuff like this, but I have been struggling with mental health issues and alcoholism. I think I'm just lonely and don't have anyone to talk to and just want to be around others for a bit. Christianity is a lot less common here in Europe than it is in the states in my experience, and I suppose I just always found Christians to be quite kind. I think in part I want there to be someone or something that watches over me as cheesy as it might sound.

I also didn't think about this as I wrote the rest, but I realize we are all in the middle of a pandemic, so I understand if that would be an additional difficulty. The rules around church services vary quite greatly from country to country to think, so I guess I'm just asking theoretically for now.

**The lectures and lessons were of no help whatsoever.** Sometimes, the subject of the lecture was an example of a loveless, strained marriage or a divorce. These were used as a warning when God isn't in one's marriage. There was one story where a wife said to her husband: ""I think you're a pain to deal with, and I want a divorce."" And so - what kind of advice was given from the pulpit? ""Ask God to come into your marriage."" ""Step up and be a good man to your wife."" ""Stop complaining. Love your wife."" Many times, marriage was not the focus of the lesson, but the discussions, lectures, etc. would relate to bad marriage as an example.

Now look: As a young unmarried man, they do not realize the effect that this has on someone like me. The lectures and discussions were about dealing with marriage on many occasions. Therefore, I could not relate to many of these lessons at all. **Know this:** If all that Christian men do is complain about their wives all day, do you think that they're setting a good example for younger men? I don't think so.

**My last straw was when we went to a men's retreat with other churches.** At one point, there was a huge lecture. We had a well-known guest pastor preach to a huge crowd of men. And what did he talk about? You guessed it - marriage. He pretty much regurgitated the same talking points I mentioned above. ""If you're having a tough marriage, be a good man to your wife."" ""Come get some counseling at the church and we'll help her."" You get the idea.

**That's when the ideas were seeded in my mind. Why even get married in the first place?** Why even bother with these struggles in the first place? God had shown me that as a single man, I was free. I caught up with that guest speaker later in that retreat and told him that based on all the things he said, I don't think I want to get married. He could not answer my concerns and just told me not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

It just does not help when the church doesn't have much answers for struggling husbands except for shaming tactics. And the rest is history. After that retreat, I left men's bible study, and accepted my singlehood. Still, many people try to convince me to change my mind about marriage, and they have trouble respecting my choices, but at the end of the day, I'm happy. I still struggle with lust on occasion, but honestly, **I'd rather struggle with that than deal with the drama of an unhappy marriage.**

This really bothers me because this isn‚Äôt what I see in the real world. Most preachers are good people. Only a small percentage of preachers are corrupt, pedophiles or con men. I don‚Äôt know any Christians who are so delusional they will sacrifice animals or go to extreme measures to prove their faith. Yes I know they exist but they are rare.

I know there is an agenda at play. I know Hollywood has been anti Christian for years. I have to wonder how much they are to blame for so many people not going to church.

I see so much ignorance about Christianity on tv, especially on talk shows. They will take the Bible out of context, use some Old Testament verse and say we are hypocrites for not following it even though that scripture clearly said it was for that time and place and not for now. 

I see famous atheist like your Bill Mahers not just be anti Christian but actually hate them and spread lies and hate about them. 

So much anti Christian sentiment is based off ignorance and absolute lies.

Today in 1895 we remember the death of Frederick Douglass an American social reformer, abolitionist, and statesman, his story inspired me as I researched for a podcast and I'd like to share it with you 

Douglas had been born as Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, and had been born into slavery on in a planation on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, probably in his grandmother's cabin. He successfully escaped from slavery after meeting and falling in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman in Baltimore about five years older than him. She strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom and after escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, becoming famous for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings. His communication skills and intellect provided a powerful counter argument to the slaveholders' arguments, that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.

His autobiography, *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American* *Slave*, became a bestseller, and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, *My Bondage and My Freedom*.  After the Civil War held several public offices and became the first African-American nominated for Vice President. He was effective because he made alliances across racial and ideological divides, which was criticised by radical abolitionists, under the motto ""No Union with Slaveholders,"".

As a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard his gran reading the Bible, as  he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity*. I was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend*. Mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. He strongly criticized religious hypocrisy and accused slaveholders of wickedness, lack of morality, and failure to follow the Golden Rule, distinguishing between the ""Christianity of Christ"" and the ""Christianity of America"" and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".

In a famous speech in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a blasphemy when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. Considering that a law passed to support slavery was ""one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty"" and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church ""stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form"", and ""an abomination in the sight of God"". As his reputation grew he visited  the United Kingdom, between 1846 and 1848, where he asked British Christians never to support American churches that permitted slavery, and expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.

Sometimes considered a precursor of a non-denominational liberation theology, Douglass was a deeply spiritual man, and on his fireplace mantle he had busts of two of his favorite philosophers, David Friedrich Strauss, author of ""The Life of Jesus"", and Ludwig Feuerbach, author of ""The Essence of Christianity"" as well as prominently displaying interior and exterior photographs of Washington's Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.

I was raised with no God my entire life.... but I want to build a relationship with Him. 

So I guess I‚Äôm here to announce the first step I‚Äôm taking, and that‚Äôs reading the Bible. If anyone has any advice or suggestions, I will gladly take it.

C.S Lewis mentions this in Mere Christianity where if a Christian where to live out their Christianity in full, they are gonna find themselves take positions to the left on certain issues(especially economic issues) while being more traditional on other issues. 

This is important because you have a lot of people who see faith strictly through a partisan lense. Especially American Christians.

But we should remember that no party or political ideology is the Kingdom of God.

And that contradiction continues to his trial where Pilate and Herod, two people from different political factions, are said to become friends because they found a common enemy in Christ.

My dad had fallen victim to a life of sin to cope with his broken marriage. And then against her will and desire, she gave birth to me. 

From day one I was left in the care of a really incompetent woman, and my father wasn‚Äôt always present to pick up the slack. I paid for this, all the way until their divorce at 4yrs old, and moved into worse conditions with my mom at her mother‚Äôs house, with her other adult brother and sister - all with the same bondage of mental health. 

I have no idea how I survived my childhood and my family up until age 17 when my dad finally got custody. He had tried my whole life, he didn‚Äôt want to be absent. My mom was a really insidious kind of manipulative and kept us separated for most of my life. Nonetheless, I crawled out of that pit of despair at 17 and into the arms of the loving parent I desperately needed. He not only rescued me from my mom and her family, he pointed me to Christ. I was an absolute mess with so much brokenness, and despite it all, I ran to Jesus and I got saved.

A lifetime of demonic bondage through generational curses and displayed abuse followed me in my immaturity of not knowing The Father and His Word well enough yet, and I opened the door for it. Over, and over. And I‚Äôd move forward, or try, and I‚Äôd get sucked back again. 5 years of being beside myself with not understanding why I couldn‚Äôt just keep my focus on Jesus, as I had come to know Him and His heart for me decently well. My church even began to call on me to preach and lead in certain aspects. There was real evidence of me following Christ. 

I‚Äôve spent the last 2 weeks losing weight, losing my mind, not sleeping and withdrawing from my family, even my 2 year old baby girl. And I just gave into believing I was a lost cause, because I obviously too, had a mental illness like my family did. I accepted that I would always fight this battle of my chains of the past keeping me bound, over and over for the rest of my life. 

I was hidden away in my office this evening when I was prompted to open my bible for the first time in weeks and at random, opened Mark 9. Holy Spirit called out the exact spirit that had convinced me I was mentally disordered and beyond help. And no sooner, my pastors wife sent me an 1:30 long spontaneous worship and asked ‚Äúwhen‚Äôs the last time you had a spiritual bubble bath?‚Äù. I went to just soak in His presence, despite feeling miles away, and He overwhelmed me with Him surrounding me, and guiding me with love to honest forgiveness and repentance of holding contempt in my heart for each family member that failed me, one at a time. 

He was patient. He was loving. He was reassuring. And I feel like a brick has been pulled out of chest, and I can feel and breath again with no fear of the future, I‚Äôm assured of His love and His presence being with me always - He even showed me the moments as a child I was huddled on the bathroom floor sobbing for my life to end, and how He was present, and covering me with His love even if I didn‚Äôt know it.

I‚Äôve spent the last 2 weeks losing weight, losing my mind, not sleeping and withdrawing from my family, even my 2 year old baby girl. And I just gave into believing I was a lost cause, because I obviously too, had a mental illness like my family did. I accepted that I would always fight this battle of my chains of the past keeping me bound, over and over for the rest of my life. 

I was hidden away in my office this evening when I was prompted to open my bible for the first time in weeks and at random, opened Mark 9. Holy Spirit called out the exact spirit that had convinced me I was mentally disordered and beyond help. And no sooner, my pastors wife sent me an 1:30 long spontaneous worship and asked ‚Äúwhen‚Äôs the last time you had a spiritual bubble bath?‚Äù. I went to just soak in His presence, despite feeling miles away, and He overwhelmed me with Him surrounding me, and guiding me with love to honest forgiveness and repentance of holding contempt in my heart for each family member that failed me, one at a time. 

He was patient. He was loving. He was reassuring. And I feel like a brick has been pulled out of chest, and I can feel and breath again with no fear of the future, I‚Äôm assured of His love and His presence being with me always - He even showed me the moments as a child I was huddled on the bathroom floor sobbing for my life to end, and how He was present, and covering me with His love even if I didn‚Äôt know it. 

I‚Äôm free y‚Äôall, that heavy thing is gone and I can go forward relentlessly with knowing I won‚Äôt hit a brick wall anymore.

MstrMatter,0.0,319.0,"As I take a look in this sub it frightens me to see people almost accepting a homosexual lifestyle and those of us who seemingly support it. While I love to see my brothers and sisters loving one another we need to keep in mind that it is a sin and we are not to accept it. You can love someone without supporting what they do. 

I struggled with Homosexuality myself and I can say from a first hand experience that I was not born that way and it didn't feel natural either. Constantly I had inner battles with myself and did not know what to do. And so I looked for answers. I read the word of God, and I then went to other Christians who I knew had also read the Bible. NOTICE: I read the Bible for myself before going to those who had. I also looked into it from a scientific perspective as many of those who had identified to be apart of the LGBT community had said they had been born this way. It turns out that there is no evidence of someone being born this way rather the opposite. Homosexuality has been influenced by environment and personal experiences. Here are the sources I have found to come to this conclusion if you are curious:

With all this being said, you are NOT supposed to hate, harass or abuse anyone who calls themselves gay, it is just a sin like all the others and we are all sinners. But it also doesn't mean that we accept the sin because it is called Love when in the Bible people are deceived many times. It doesn't help the cause. And if you want me to prove that you are born straight, I most certainly can.

Edit 1: Ok, I have been looking through the responses of this all day and I simply cannot respond to all of these. I have College work to do and Finals to start getting ready for. With that being said, the most frequent thing I see is people discussing the matter of being born gay and while I have learned a lot from some of you, a lot of you are being quite mean and cruel which is wrong in every aspect. I made this post to not only spark a discussion so that I may learn more, but to also see where my own people stand on this issue and for the most part I am relieved. 

I just want to say this, the reason I think people are born straight is due to simple biology and how we go about creating life. Rather you are a gay man or a lesbian Woman you were still born with the ability to create children. In other words, if a gay man was to sleep with a woman and release his semen inside her, that semen would look for the egg. No matter how much that man said he is attracted to something else, his human nature has already been written from the start. The same case can be said about a lesbian woman, she still gets monthly reminders (her period) that she is to bare a child, no matter how much that woman said she was attracted to other woman her human nature has already been written. This is not a coincidence. Sperm does not look for an egg just because it's sperm or evolution nor does a woman get her period every month just because she's a woman. Someone made it that way, it was intended to be this way. And that someone was God. He didn't make two people of the opposite sex in the beginning and tell them to reproduce so that we could go and have sex with the same gender. It's simple. Now if you want to say this does not play any part in attraction, I'd beg to differ as we can see through puberty our, for the lack of a better terminology, default setting is still maturing so that it can find a mate and have children with. Of course every situation has it's extreme cases, rather somebody is infertile or we have 200 species of animals who participate in this activity, but this does not mean it was meant to be this way. We live in a fallen world, sin is rampant and keeps us seperated from God, of course without your Creator around to take care of you, things would get rough as if a Farmer leaving his crops unattended.  It was us who brought this upon ourselves and it is God who is trying to help lead us back to glory. Now if you want to sit here and read in between the lines of every single verse and try and downplay or reword them so that you can benefit from it, firstly, you're wrong for doing so as you won't benefit from it. Secondly, you're missing the entire point of the Bible, it literally stands for BASIC INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE LEAVING EARTH and I don't think it would take all that much effort to understand and follow something with the help of Christ; it isn't called basic for no reason. 

I have also seen people state that I am still gay, implying that I'm lying. I don't know what I can tell you. I have no reason to lie. I have much better things to do than sit here and think of some made up story about my life. Of course I still have thoughts of it, but it has/is drastically decreasing every day. And I'm confident when I say that one day I will no longer have those desires &amp; thoughts. If you still don't believe me, that's fine, I have nothing to prove to you or anyone else, just know that this isn't an extreme circumstance I speak of. 

I have also seen a lot of people talking about my fruits, implying that I'm a false prophet and/or wishing me pain. I can tell you where I've come from, my walk of life so far. I don't know if I'm a prophet, I would be honored if I was and probably wouldn't be able to believe it. I'm just here to get some insight that's all. It's fine if you can ""win"" the debate, I'm not here to win, just need to understand better. I am ignorant as is everyone else and I seek knowledge.

[deleted],0.0,316.0,"He was 20 years old and was supposed to ship out to Marine basic training last month but got delayed due to Covid. We played baseball together and we loved every minute of it until we were out of high school. When I heard the news I was upset to say the least. But I was more upset because even after 6 years of knowing each other I had never asked him about his relationship to God. After I heard the only thing I could say to God was: ""I hope he is with you now"". Because I didn't know. For 10 days I was plagued by what I should have done differently, and how I could've asked. I never invited him to come to church because he said he was going somewhere else but we never talked much more than that. So I've sat awake at night wondering if I'd ever see him again. 

Today was the day of the funeral and the day God reminded me that he still works even without me. The pastor shared a number of verses and mentioned his salvation which was bittersweet. I hugged his parents and told them we'd see him again, and the hope that was in their eyes was something only God can provide and I've only seen in those who truly know they'll see them in heaven again. 

So, my brothers and sisters, God still works in this world and is still saving and healing souls even without our help (duh). And He's still giving hope to everyone who wants it. But don't wait to talk to your friends about their relationship with God. It's much better to know for sure than to wonder at night. You better believe I've asked all my friends about their beliefs since he passed and I won't make the same mistake I did with my friend. I will live the rest of my days in hope of what's to come, with sadness I have to wait to see my God and my friends and loved ones again. And I pray all of you will hug your friends and family tight and talk with them. life is short and death can come at any time for any of us.

kcdd,0.0,302.0,"I was born with liver disease and a heart condition.  By my late 20s, I had three heart surgeries and one major liver surgery that included several years of illness.  I struggled with both romance and employment in my 20s.  I ended up doing lots of volunteering which led to lay pastor work and church planting.  I did have seasons where I was able to work, but another bout of illness always arose.  I have had a (chronic persistent) disability pension since I was in my late 20s.   


In my early 30s, I met her.  She was wonderful to be around.  I left for Europe for a mission trip that was supposed to last one year.  We stayed friends. Two months in, my liver failed and I was hospitalized for 6 months.  She kept calling, I told her I was probably always going to be sick and life would be hard with me. She didn't care. She said if this works, ""for better or worse...""   


We married about a year after I came home - 2 1/2 years after we met.  I was very ill when we married. Our honeymoon was derailed and I was hospitalized. I had two major surgeries with complications during our first 3 years.  We prayed together and stayed together. Sex was hard and became harder and harder, but we tried.  I started to get better and started to go to university in my mid-30s. She got a Federal job, making great money.  We had a baby boy. He was brilliant. A very fast learner and he had a great memory, but then we realized he had autism. He is so smart and such a fast thinker he has no social awareness.  We love him regardless.   


Then I had liver failure for the 3rd time, leading to transplantation.  I have since had 2 transplants. The transplants were complicated and there were complications afterward.  We moved into a new home, but I didn't get better. Yes, the new liver helped, but I now just don't heal well and I struggle with the side effects of all the medications.  I had my last liver Tx in 2017 and the incision has burst open. I have a 23cm hernia.  I am waiting for surgery in about 6 weeks.  


We are both illegitimate children. Our parents never married and never lived together.  We are estranged from half-brothers and half-sisters we never met. Both of our parents died early.  Our family has always been our circle of friends we've built. She is a marathon runner, goes to the gym regularly, and eats healthy.  I struggle to get food into me, am depressed, and rarely leave the house.  She took on all the work, but I tried my hardest to do chores and take care of our son.  She loves the outdoors. I still do also and I am adventurous, but just don't have strength or energy anymore. As our lives progressed I watched her spark disappear. The bubbly smile and bounce she had are gone.  


Last week, I had biopsies for cancer.  I am on about 20+ pills a day and one has a significant risk for cancer.  I could feel her insides snap when we found out.  One morning I felt her pain and could see that she couldn't take it anymore.  I called everyone I knew, pastors, long-time friends, family. I knew she/we were in trouble.    


Last Friday, she told me, ""I can't do this anymore. I am divorcing you"".  


We have always done a ""check-in.""  Two to three times a week we go for a coffee and talk about where we are at, our feelings, and where our marriage is going.  When we both got married we struggled with money, but now we have very little debt and a positive net worth.    


Part of me accepts that I am just going to be sick and things won't get better; therefore, I want to let her go to find peace and maybe love again.  I see her pain and struggle.  She has given me 16 years. In many ways, she enables me to stay a victim, the sick guy, the disabled husband.  There are no real 'biblical grounds'; for her to leave me. Neither of us has committed adultery, nor has there been abuse. But there has been a breakdown, a failure.  


We both consider ourselves committed Christians, but we are also realists.  Tonight we sat together and talked for 2 hours about the problems we have faced over the years.  We talked about the pain we both feel. We talked about dashed hopes and broken dreams. We talked about being friends and co-parenting. We talked about dividing assets and money.  We talked about how divorce is an identity destroyer, the exclusion that severs the soul, especially when church people are self-righteous about covenant and don't understand the mercy of the cross.  But we also talked about embracing a new identity as friends and co-parents. We talked about her finding healing, being alone and rediscovering ourselves. I have very little hope for myself, but I can have hope for her.  


Honestly, I am not sure why I am writing this here.  I want to hold on and fight to repair and heal our marriage, but there is a part of me that is too tired to fight for it anymore.  Part of me just wants to be alone and not cause pain to others.

First of all, I want to thank you guys for being an amazing subreddit. Often, I'll be scrolling through Reddit looking at all the negativity in the world and I'll see one of your posts and I'll just be so uplifted and encouraged. Just to give some context, I grew up in the church and never really gave any thought to why Christianity was important to me until high school. I went through an extremely dark time in high school and in the beginning, all I could do was blame God for my unfortunate circumstances. However, through all the darkness, I learned to lean on God rather than make Him the target of my sin and burden. I tried to read the entire Bible multiple times through high school but failed every time.

In January of 2020, I made the decision to read the Bible all the way through, no matter what. I started off strong, as most people do when they first make a resolution. When I entered college in August, I hit a rough patch and I set my Bible aside for 2 months; during this time, my old struggles returned and I once again neglected God. When I got home for winter break, I opened my Bible, and immediately, I was so overwhelmed with guilt and emotion. I began to read again and I fell into the rhythm; during this time, my bond with God grew stronger and I felt spiritually strong. Today, January 20, 2021, I finally finished Revelations. It's a relatively small accomplishment, but as someone who struggled with his faith for a long time, it feels good to be able to see progress in my journey. 

If anyone reading this is struggling with getting through the Bible or just faith in general, the only advice I have for you is to submit everything to God. It sounds dumb but when we try to do things with our own strength, we often fail and it creates a disconnect in our relationship with Him. I tried so hard to do everything by myself, but I only saw progress when I failed. If someone as broken as me can do it, you definitely can!

ztp1234,0.0,281.0,"I grew up in a hell-fire and brimstone preaching family... Recently I had an issue where the anxiety of being a Christian was not worth even believing in it anymore, so I gave up.

After a few years away and the anxiety from the fear of hell... I decided to pick up a bible from an adult 100% unbias POV and interpret scripture and who Jesus was myself... I came to one conclusion; Jesus is who he says he is, the son of god.

He loves us and is willing to die for us, so what went wrong last time? Through studying and prayer, I finally figured out what caused that anxiety... Satan's deception.

Jesus in the bible constantly reiterates... Love others as yourself, loving others as yourself, do good unto others, even those that hate you (Etc.). What happens when anyone walks up and starts concerning themselves with other thing (like the Pharisees and the sabbath day) Jesus refutes it and puts the wellbeing of others above everything.

I read and interpreted the ten commandments differently this time around. I don't even feel commandments is the proper term, I feel like the commandments are an instruction manual from the manufacturer on how to operate ourselves.

 1. Love god over anything else

. 2. Love each other as ourselves

 3. Don't work 7 days a week (we do not serve the sabbath, ""the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath""). This in my opinion is Satan's largest deception out of god's word, he has divided a large part of the church just by causing anger over what day we worship Christ over. We need to live like Christ for SEVEN days a week, not 1. Again, the Sabbath according to Jesus ""was made for man"" to rest, not be an important holy day to send people to hell over. 

4. Honor your father and mother (if everyone lived as christ intended we would easily be able to follow this, honor doesn't have to mean worship, but don't curse them.) I understand some had rough parents, but if we follow commandment 2 and ""turn the other cheek"" this falls into place.

 5. Thou shalt not kill. 

6. Don't have affairs...

 7. Don't steal.

 8. Don't lie or have other gods before him.

9. Don't lust over someone else's spouse. 

10. Don't be jealous of what someone else has. 

Now... What does Satan do? He takes these ten commandments and makes EVERYTHING complex as he did with the Pharisees in the time of Jesus... The Jews crucified god's son, and they took the commandments just as literally as anyone. 

100% of Jesus's message on earth was about serving others and not harming others (sinful activities 9.5/10 times end up hurting others)... We make mistakes, but we follow many of the rules on a daily basis just by law... 

Many Christians criticize people who are gay, had abortions, are prostitutes, liars, thieves, murderers... Those we're Jesus's friends... Those we're the people he ate with, laughed with, prayed with, and served... 

Ultimately, that is where Satan is winning the war... God sent his son to earth and made is so SIMPLE, all we had to do is love one another and not hurt each other... and we ALL would inherit the kingdom of god! What happened? Satan overcomplicated something so simple and we now have 10+ denominations and a religion that non-believers feel are 1. hypocrites 2. Judgemental 3. and super conservative. 

I apologize if you disagree with me, I believe sincerely that Jesus's message on earth was to concern yourself with serving others, not what the new set of rules is after the old testament like Satan leads the church to believe. We all can do a better job of being like Jesus, 1. Stopping and offering to take the homeless man to lunch and share Christ 2. Serving others without time, not just worrying about how much money to serve with. 3. Ultimately just doing a better job of being better friends; praying for each other and not wasting time on debating what is right or wrong... If we have the holy spirit and our number 1 concern is serving others every day as Jesus did, all that will fall into place. I'm sure Jesus heard many raunchy jokes, saw many people with terrible diseases, and saw lots of sin, that didn't stop him from loving. Ultimately, we need to remember we get to be with God by believing in Christ, not following rules... I can base my theory on how I know I'm right, these arguments are the reason we have 5 churches on Sundays half full within 5 miles of each other instead of 2-3 full ones.

kittyrina1,0.0,278.0,"As women we are always blamed for our bodies or how we look, that it is our fault men stumble. But where do these opinions come from? What should we teach our daughters or sisters? That their bodies are shameful and should cover everything? Well let's first dive in, into what the bible says...

**The bible doesn't teach that bodies are shameful.**

Genesis makes it clear that our Creator *delights* in us. God called humans the highlight of creation. We weren't simple ""good"", but *""very good""*. 

In the Psalms, we're told that humans are *fearfully and wonderfully made* (Psalm 139). I am sure everyone who reads this verse, feels their confidence boost a little.üòÜüíì

Paul describes a mystery beyond imagination: our bodies are the **home of the Holy Spirit** and we are **a part of Christ**!. And Peter, wrote that we are built into **God's spiritual temple** and already *are* His holy, royal priests (1Peter 2:5,9). 

If God considered our bodies shameful, he wouldn't make His home in us. Our *whole* body is His temple, not just some parts, like only half our legs or half our arms..

God rejoices in the *forms* He created. That didn't change when sin and shame entered the world, in fact it was *humans* who felt shame of being naked, not how God made us to be. Weren't Adam and Eve *both* naked before they sinned? Nakedness was no problem before they sinned. Therefore their bodies are *not* what is shameful. It's **sin.**

**The bible doesn't teach that the victim is at fault.**

I don't even know why this is a thing tbh. But here we go. I can't find a single situation where the Bible implied that sexual assault is the woman's fault or what she wore that day. Bathsheba (2Samuel 11), Tamar (2Samuel 13), Dinah (Genesis 34) - all three stories are instances where *men* sinned, not as examples of women who ""had it coming"" because of how they behaved or dressed. It's sad that these words could come from Christian men today. It's her fault she had a short skirt..How short should a skirt be to tell someone not to sexually assault them? üßêüìù

Scripture doesn't even *imply* that Bathsheba shouldn't have bathed naked where David could see her. It was actually David's sin. It doesn't admonish Tamar for going into her half-brother's bedroom without a forethought. Or Dinah because she was wondering into the ""wrong part of town"" at the ""wrong time"". These women all suffered terrible harm, but there is no biblical evidence that members of their communities asked them what they were wearing or how late they were out. 

Scripture does say however, that the responsibility falls on the *perpetrator*. Not because the women were beautiful and the men couldn't help themselves. When Paul talks about sexual sin, he argues that, *""You can't say that our bodies were made for sexual immorality""(1 Corinthians 6:13).* Seems to me that Paul was contradicting those who said male bodies are *biologically programmed* to respond to sexual urges. 

**The Bible does not teach that we can blame others for our sin.**

Jesus's teaching is consistent with Paul's thoughts on sexual immorality. He warns that *""everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28).* Jesus doesn't add ""unless she's dressed revealingly"" or ""except when you feel like you can't control yourself"". I'm sure Jesus would have said that, **if** it was the *woman's fault.* 

**The bible doesn't teach a dress code.**

 In 1Timothy 2:9 and 1Peter 3:3-4, Paul and Peter are addressing the same issue, and it's not lack of body coverage. **It's excess.** They appeal to women who felt the need to show everyone else in the church how much they could **afford** to look good.
The word ""modesty"" in these verses means ""downcast eyes"". In other words, Paul is advocating *humility* and *self control.* 

It was about the being prideful in their clothes and how expensive they were. Their sin was *pride* - not immodesty. Our confidence should come from inwards and reflect outwards. 

Just because a woman is covered and *looks* modest does not mean inside she is like that. Inwards she might feel differently. Her heart could actually be very depressed, bitter etc.Or even her actions would actually be ungodly. What I want to say here, is that it is not the *clothes* that make the woman, it's her heart, her actions, her speech. 

So should we have no rules? I'm not entirely sure, I believe women know how to dress appropriately for ocassion but what I know that the bible teaches is *self and mutual respect.*

We need to teach girls that **their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, amazing creations of God, and priceless purchases bought by Christ. Girls should learn to respect and love their bodies because they're created in the image of God.**

The purpose of the human body is to bear that sacred image, in a dark, crazy world. That's what we should be telling girls, and also boys.


Edit:

Please note this comes from experience. I was sexually abused as a child. So I know how it feels, and that it was not my fault. Not the clothes I wore, not my body, but it was the sin in the respective man.  And yes I've forgiven him, because I know the Lord knows and that He is just. He has forgiven my many sins and I will praise Him forever more. My freedom comes from Him and from forgiveness. And I will not be ashamed of who I am now in Jesus. I am a new creation as all believers are. And my body is not who I am, my identity in Christ is who I am. Who we all are.

Not the clothes I wore, not my body, but it was the sin in the respective man.  And yes I've forgiven him, because I know the Lord knows and that He is just. He has forgiven my many sins and I will praise Him forever more. My freedom comes from Him and from forgiveness. And I will not be ashamed of who I am now in Jesus. I am a new creation as all believers are. And my body is not who I am, my identity in Christ is who I am. Who we all are.

She doesn't even think she's in a hospital. She also has a terrible quality of life. The doctor said she needed to be placed on a respirator, but recommended against it. Not much of a chance that she would have a positive outcome. I decided to go along with what the doctor wanted. She also wouldn't have wanted to live on a machine.

On Mother's day, I had a friend from Church on a group call to check if she had accepted Jesus as her savior. We think she did, but I'm not sure what the cutoff limit is for being saved. I'm not even sure about myself, because of my own shortcomings. But I will leave that for another thread. I want this one to be about my mom.

About 9 months ago my father was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer. Ever since then, he's lost a lot of weight and his energy level has tanked. It's extremely hard to see him in his old clothes, and seeing how loose they are around his arms and legs. It's affecting is us all a lot and keeps our minds occupied.

Tomorrow he will get a scan that will ultimately decide what treatment possibilties are still possible. Currently, no treatment has worked and the only treatment that would work.. Well, odds are slim of him surviving that, or even being in a good enough shape for him to get selected for it. From a human perspective; he's terminal, the odds are not in his favor and the prognosis isn't good.

It is hard for me to think about anything else right now, and I just pray and hope that whatever will come out of that test can give us some shimmer of hope; and if not, that we as a family atleast can spend proper time together and talk things through properly.

Today is my birthday, I am 26 years old. I realize now that as a new Christian, my birthday holds a new significnace. I feel like I am today truly reborn and now can walk with Christ. I didn't expect to have this realization, but it dawned on me that actually today IS my birthday in a spiritual sense. Today the Lord Jesus Christ has made a home in my heart.

This morning my grandmother called me, she has been a Christian for all of her life. She has seen my spiritual walk for the last 10 years and how lost and confused I was, wandering around the domains of spirituality and New Age. I tried everything, I mean everything, to find the truth. I trained as a Hare Krishna monk for some time. I lived with all kinds of spiritual teachers. Yet in the end I found Jesus Christ and for this my heart sings! 

My grandmother is now very old. She was the only person in my family who found Jesus and has been a constant inspiration to me over the years. She is the only one in my family I can talk to about God and the bible. 

Today I told her I have become a Christian and she cried. Cried with joy and happiness shouting at the top of her lungs ""Hellelujah!"" She could not hold her excitement and it was a very special moment for us both.

I think I made her day... She said she had been waiting for this moment for years. 

Praise the Lord!

GerbilNinja27,0.0,255.0," John Spencer Lucas III died peacefully in his sleep last night. He and his wife (my grandmother) knew each other for over 50 years, starting off as friends in childhood. At 19, my grandma married off to grandpa and they had 3 children, Samuel, John, and Elizabeth. These are my uncles and Elizabeth is my mother. Then my mother found a man, my father, and they conceived me and my younger brother. The usual chain of things followed in the family. 

Grandpa was a firefighter, a job who surprisingly many people forget the bravery and danger of. My grandma was a nurse, delivering new lives into the world. This means their children were left at home sometimes, with the eldest child John (commonly called Johnny by the family) was in charge. Both parents would get home tired but have the weekends free. They lived in a cozy house by the beach, one which many memories were made. Photography was another hobby for grandpa, and he sometimes did this professionally as well. It was his greatest passion, watching his children (and soon grandchildren) grow up, and recording it all as memories.

The beach was one of his favorite spots to go and make sandcastles with me, my brother, and cousins. Then we would go back to the house and enjoy a dinner on the patio and sometimes stay the night. Almost everyone my grandfather met would become his friend sooner or later. An example of this is a woman who lived down the street whose legs were too unstable to walk around on her own, so he would help her by driving her around wherever she wanted. He did this on on Tuesdays, every week. When his own father (my great grandfather) had Parkinson's that got to severe was unable to move out of his home alone, he also did the same thing by making sure they did something fun and unique every week.

After his father and mother died, grandpa shed the only tear he ever shed, because he had a disorder where he could not cry. After this, he continued to help others. He received plaques for his donated blood, so much was given from him that my mother once exclaimed, ""Daddy, soon you'll run out!"" He was a true Christian who really would gives the clothes off his back to someone who needed it. For the homeless people on the streets, my father was always skeptical of them, saying ""Who knows, they could be rich and earning money off of lies! I can't take the risk, I'll give them food but not money. Otherwise they could go and blow it all off on alcohol and drugs."" My grandpa was not like this. One day while walking down the street with my father, he handed a $20 bill to a man holding a sign. My father informed him this was foolish, but he just replied ""It's between them and God if they are telling the truth. I'd rather give money to an imposter than refuse to give to those who really need it.""

In my early childhood years, me and grandpa would do ""flashlight adventures"" when it was dark, with me and him sneaking out and searching the unknown with a flashlight in each hand. We once found a fish skeleton, adding it to the list of 'treasures.' Our relationship grew as I aged. Unfortunately, bad news came the day my brother was born. I didn't know about this on our times together, because it was too hard to notice for quite a while. He had Parkinson's. A terrible disease, seemingly harmless at first. His hands would shake at the most random of times, but he would steady them. Sitting in his car by the park, just me and him, I asked why his hands shook. He chuckled and replied ""I have Parkinson's.""

Years later, the blood clots started on one of his legs. He landed in the hospital and they seemingly fixed it. From then on he was never quite as strong physically. After that he got blood clots in the other leg, which forced him to sit down every now and then so they wouldn't swell up. After a while grandpa and his wife moved into a condo because the house by the beach was too much for them to keep up with. The condo was so much smaller and I hated it because the nostalgia from the old house plagued me. Moving in with their cat Guinndillane and their Aubie the trusty dog, they settled in. After an even longer time, the doctors agreed that the blood clots could not be removed because a growth in his brain could be disrupted, removing his memory. It would be too great of a loss, so offers for surgery were denied.

Much later, grandpa collapsed while trying to get into bed. The ambulance had to come over there three times already, but this was the most severe. They took him to the hospital and kept him there for a couple weeks. Because of coronavirus they only allowed one person at a time to visit. He would hallucinate some days, imagining that he was bleeding or colorful bubbles were floating in the air. A UTI (urinary tract infection) was discovered during his time at the hospital. They tried to remove and another one emerged. He was moved to a rehabilitation facility, which only allowed one 15 minute visit per week. Besides that you could stand by the windows outside to look in on patients. Me and my family would come to deliver milkshakes to him during this time. And we stood to talk with him on the phone as often as possible.

After months, grandpa's wish finally came true. He was allowed to go back to the condo, although he had to lay on a hospital bed in the middle of the living room. He was positioned to look out at the ocean and the TV. We would go over there to see him in person again. Some days were horrible where he would shake violently at night, not sleeping for up to two days. Others were good, where he was lucid and able to talk. At Thanksgiving he was able to pray for the food, saying ""Dear Lord, thank you for this meal and this wonderful time together. Please bless me and my family with all of your might."" Through all this time, however, he stayed in bed. Stacks upon stacks of pills lined the tables, none of which seemed to be working. He would have trouble eating, as his sense of taste was messed up.

Eventually I discovered that he had not eaten for 4 days. Knowing this would kill him if kept up, I prayed hospice would provide an IV. They didn't. Hospice cares for a patient's comfort, not care. Grandma was able to get a few drops of protein drink into him, but it wasn't much. He was already skin and bones, but by then the statement was very literal. The last words I heard from him were, ""It was good to see you. I love you."" ""I love you too,"" I replied. Yesterday Christmas carolers came in to sing songs to him, and he tried to sing along, but he was too weak.  I prayed for days and days to God to heal him, including last night. In the morning I was told he was found unresponsive. Rest in peace, wonderful man.

He now can run with no hinderance, talk with no murmuring, and celebrate with the Lord. His last words were to my grandma. She asked, ""Are you ready to see Jesus, Spencer?"" He replied with his eyes closed and slightly smiled, whispering ""*Always.*""

The last words I heard from him were, ""It was good to see you. I love you."" ""I love you too,"" I replied. Yesterday Christmas carolers came in to sing songs to him, and he tried to sing along, but he was too weak.  I prayed for days and days to God to heal him, including last night. In the morning I was told he was found unresponsive. Rest in peace, wonderful man.

He now can run with no hinderance, talk with no murmuring, and celebrate with the Lord. His last words were to my grandma. She asked, ""Are you ready to see Jesus, Spencer?"" He replied with his eyes closed and slightly smiled, whispering ""*Always.*""

There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.‚Äù - Revelation 21:4, New King James Version",grandpa pass john spencer lucas iii die peacefully sleep last night wife grandmother knew 50 year start friend childhood 19 grandma married grandpa 3 child samuel john elizabeth uncle elizabeth mother mother found man father conceive young brother usual chain thing follow family grandpa firefighter job surprisingly many people forget bravery danger grandma nurse deliver new life world mean child left home sometimes eldest child john commonly call johnny family charge parent would get home tire weekend free live cozy house beach one many memory make photography another hobby grandpa sometimes professionally well great passion watch child soon grandchild grow record memory beach one favorite spot go make sandcastles brother cousin would go back house enjoy dinner patio sometimes stay night almost everyone grandfather met would become friend sooner later example woman live street whose leg unstable walk around would help drive around wherever want tuesday every week father great grandfather parkinson get severe unable move home alone also thing make sure something fun unique every week father mother die grandpa shed tear ever shed disorder could cry continued help others receive plaque donate blood much give mother exclaim daddy soon run true christian really would give clothes back someone need homeless people street father always skeptical say know could rich earn money lie take risk give food money otherwise could go blow alcohol drug grandpa like one day walk street father hand $20 bill man hold sign father inform foolish reply god tell truth rather give money imposter refuse give really need early childhood year grandpa would flashlight adventure dark sneak search unknown flashlight hand found fish skeleton add list treasure relationship grow age unfortunately bad news come day brother born know time together hard notice quite parkinson terrible disease seemingly harmless first hand would shake random time would steady sit car park ask hand shook chuckle reply parkinson year later blood clot start one leg land hospital seemingly fix never quite strong physically get blood clot leg force sit every swell grandpa wife move condo house beach much keep condo much small hat nostalgia old house plague move cat guinndillane aubie trusty dog settle even longer time doctor agree blood clot could remove growth brain could disrupt remove memory would great loss offer surgery deny much later grandpa collapse try get bed ambulance come three time already severe take hospital kept couple week coronavirus allow one person time visit would hallucinate day imagine bleeding colorful bubble float air uti urinary tract infection discover time hospital try remove another one emerge move rehabilitation facility allow one 15 minute visit per week besides could stand window outside look patient family would come deliver milkshake time stood talk phone often possible month grandpa wish finally come true allow go back condo although lay hospital bed middle living room position look ocean tv would go see person day horrible would shake violently night sleep two day others good lucid able talk thanksgiving able pray food say dear lord thank meal wonderful time together please bless family might time however stayed bed stack upon stack pill line table none seem work would trouble eat sense taste mess eventually discover eat 4 day know would kill kept prayed hospice would provide iv hospice care patient comfort care grandma able get drop protein drink much already skin bone statement literal last word heard good see love love reply yesterday christmas caroler come sing song try sing along weak prayed day day god heal include last night morning told found unresponsive rest peace wonderful man run hinderance talk murmur celebrate lord last word grandma ask ready see jesus spencer reply eye close slightly smile whisper always god wipe away every tear eye shall death sorrow cry shall pain former thing pass away revelation 21 4 new king james version

I have struggled with mental illness since I was a kid. I had three suicide attempts as a middle schooler due to bullying. I found my faith originally just before my third one. When I went to go through with it, I felt God with me and stopped. 

Fast forward to adulthood. My dad passed away when I was 19 (I'm 23 now). After that and a few other traumas, I did everything I could to numb myself and was on the path to becoming an alcoholic. I got so good at being numb, I stopped making connections with people and in turn lost my faith in God. I lived in constant anxiety from my OCD. I have been in therapy for the past year or so though which helped lead me to where I am now. 

A few weeks ago, I prayed for the first time in a long time. I prayed that God would help me not be numb anymore. I felt my walls shatter almost instantly.

It was almost too much to handle when my feelings came back. It was like I felt all my sadness, anger, joy, grief, etc come back all at once. I had a bit of a mental breakdown. But I felt God with me. He led me to a mental hospital. I stayed there for a week or so. 

I have kept praying and listening to Him. Since then, my boyfriend is now my fiance. He lead us both to a church that my dad's old best friend preaches at. We are joining by Baptism in a couple weeks. I have found a wonderful job and will hopefully be going back to school in October. I have learned to reconnect with people again. My mental health is completely manageable now, and I don't feel as though I need alcohol to function anymore. 

I fully believe if God hadn't worked the way He did, or if I hadn't had listened, I would be dead by my own hand.

It describes the contradictory and mutually exclusive attacks on a gay user (often me) within just seconds of one another. 

**Example 1:**

&gt;Them: You‚Äôre ignorant of the Bible. If you just read it and study these passages, you‚Äôll see that the Bible clearly condemns homosexuality. 

&gt;Me: I‚Äôve actually been studying this issue for over a decade. I‚Äôm well aware of what the Bible says.

&gt;Them: See, that‚Äôs the issue. You‚Äôve studied it *too much* and you‚Äôre overcomplicating things. 

**Example 2:**

&gt;Them: You‚Äôre just gay because it‚Äôs the easy road. Jesus said to take up your cross and that there will be troubles if you follow him. 

&gt;Me: Actually, becoming a gay-affirming Christian has been a troublesome road. I‚Äôve lost family and friends. I‚Äôm following Christ‚Äôs call for justice and l‚Äôm carrying my cross, just like he said to do.

&gt;Them: The troubles you‚Äôre encountering are God trying to correct you and get you back on the right path. 

**Example 3:**

&gt;Them: This gay-affirming church is shrinking ‚Äî must be because they‚Äôre abandoning the Word of God. 

&gt;Them later: This gay-affirming church is growing ‚Äî that‚Äôs just because they‚Äôre pandering to itching ears. 

In these examples, I both *haven‚Äôt* read the Bible enough *and* have read it too much. My alleged *lack* of hardships means I‚Äôm not following Christ, *and* my hardships mean I‚Äôm not following Christ. Gay-affirming churches shrinking means they‚Äôre falling away, *and* gay-affirming churches growing means they‚Äôre falling away.

The only explanation is that these heuristics, the content of these critiques, *don‚Äôt actually mean anything*. I‚Äôm the enemy, I‚Äôm in the wrong, no matter if these critiques apply to me or not! The logic is going backwards, starting with ‚Äúme being wrong‚Äù and then backing into a critique of me that can shift and mutate *depending on any single set of facts about me*. 

Christians (or any rational thinkers) should never have a ready-made conclusion and work backwards into their arguments. It‚Äôs facially anti-intellectual. And when the conclusion is about *another human being who bears the image of God*, then it is patently unloving as well.

[deleted],0.0,241.0,"I‚Äôve been there before when your living in constant fear n anxiety 

i ain‚Äôt telling you to sin, Just don‚Äôt overthink it. God loves you, he ain‚Äôt against he‚Äôs for you. David killed a man n stole his wife. but he repented realized what he did was wrong n turned from it. Fear of the Lord is good which brings peace n understanding not constant dread n anxiety.

The Spirit of the Lord is not fear n timidness but it is power love n self discipline. Christ died for you for a reason. Myself included we all need to be a little more lighthearted n easygoing. We are Christians. That makes us different from the world n if you still living in constant dread you ain‚Äôt different. Ain‚Äôt nobody going to want to be Christian when they see us judging and afraid out of our mind. 

1 John 4:18 
There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.

John 14:27
27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.

Matthew 20:28 
‚Äújust as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.‚Äù

Isaiah 35:4
say to those with fearful hearts, ‚ÄúBe strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you.‚Äù

Isaiah 41:13
For I am the Lord your God
    who takes hold of your right hand
and says to you, Do not fear;
    I will help you.

Ecclesiastes 7:15-18
15 In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these:
the righteous perishing in their righteousness,
    and the wicked living long in their wickedness.
16 Do not be overrighteous,
    neither be overwise‚Äî
    why destroy yourself?
17 Do not be overwicked,
    and do not be a fool‚Äî
    why die before your time?
18 It is good to grasp the one
    and not let go of the other.
    Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.

Ecclesiastes 9:10-11
9 You who are young, be happy while you are young,
    and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth.
Follow the ways of your heart
    and whatever your eyes see,
but know that for all these things
    God will bring you into judgment.
10 So then, banish anxiety from your heart
    and cast off the troubles of your body,
    for youth and vigor are meaningless.

For the fear of God brings wisdom, confidence, courage, refuge, n peace that transcends all human understanding in Christ. 
That is why we boldly proclaim the Word of God because of the confidence we have in our salvation!

Isaiah 33:6
And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.

Proverbs 14:26
In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence, And 
his children will have refuge.

Psalm 139:23-24
Search me, God, and know my heart;
    test me and know my anxious thoughts.
24 See if there is any offensive way in me,
    and lead me in the way everlasting.

Psalm 27:1

once_profane,0.0,237.0,"We should all be familiar with the seven deadly sins. One of the sins that I find I have to make sure to keep in check is Gluttony.

On the surface it seems the Sin of Gluttony is about food and not binging on it, or over eating.

However I am observing that the Sin likely does and should apply to everything that you could possibly binge on. In particular, certain activities that shouldn't be consumed in succession for hours and hours with no break and no by product from creation.

What I mean by this is that we should not just make sure we don't over eat. We should also pay mind to what activities we are doing and not over consume them as well. Watching Netflix, watching Music Videos, playing video games, listening to music, etc. Even reading books (while arguably better than the others) needs to be tapered off at a point. Not only does consuming these activities endlessly damage your mind in the form of endless dopamine rushes, you are often left with nothing to show for the time spent.

It would be far better to be in a mode of creation. You could learn to play an instrument, or build a video game. At least you would have something to show for the time spent and could possibly even sell these things and support your family.

Remember to keep your passions in check.

my_words_,0.0,231.0,"I‚Äôm a high school senior, so this time was/is a little bit confusing for me. College decisions are being released, and in a few weeks, I will have to commit to a school I am accepted into. You might dismiss what I have to say because I am only a high school senior, but I came to relive and relearn something. 

I believe myself to be a decent student ‚Äî not the top student, but above average, within the top 5% of my class ‚Äî who has a decent resume of extracurricular activities. 

Two days ago, a college rejected me. Yesterday, one college waitlisted me and another rejected me. Then, two colleges waitlisted me and another rejected me. Sounds bleak, I know. But because of my fear of being rejected, I grew more desperate for the Lord‚Äôs guidance and his help. 

At first my prayers were filled with ‚ÄúFather God, I would like to go to X college or Y university,‚Äù and/or something along the lines of, ‚ÄúPlease let me get accepted.‚Äù And then they evolved to ‚ÄúFather God, I would like to go to X college or Y university. Please show me Your grace.‚Äù My prayers slowly started changing until they became ‚ÄúFather God, let Your will be done. Wherever I am meant to go, please guide me.‚Äù I started changing from this concept of ‚Äúmy wants‚Äù to ‚ÄúHis plan.‚Äù 

And then, today, I got my acceptance. Amidst all my ‚Äúworldly failures‚Äù, God never forgot me. I still am waiting on results, and I still get uneasy every time they are to release, but God has given me peace and put my heart at rest. He got me through this, and he‚Äôll get me through the rest.

Whenever things don‚Äôt go my way, almost as if on instinct, I almost always first looked to God; not to ask Him for guidance, no. I tried to blame Him at first because it‚Äôs always easier to do that then face reality. This life I live is to be one that is God-centered, not self-centered. I am not that person anymore. It isn‚Äôt the college season that constantly reminds me to live for God. Everything that surrounds me always points to God ‚Äî as our Creator, Savior, and awesome Father. I will work until that wherever I look, I first see the Lord‚Äôs power and the beauty of His creations.

Regardless of whatever came my way ‚Äî physical injuries, emotional pain, other struggles ‚Äî  God always protected me. He always heard my prayers before I thought or said them. He is an omnipotent, omniscient God. Praise to the Father, now and forever.

Everyone has a sex drive and it needs to be taught where to use it appropriately (in marriage), but the idea that sex is a dirty thing that can never be talked about hurts more people than it helps. This mindset that sex is always so bad and evil needs to go away.",christian need stop see sex bad dirty thing god make sex literally first commandment adam eve sex fruitful multiply talk friend church several month ago casually say word sex sentence rebuke say bad word type mindset unrealistic everyone sex drive need taught use appropriately marriage idea sex dirty thing never talk hurt people help mindset sex always bad evil need go away

[deleted],0.0,212.0,"My walk with God has been challenging and long. But, now, I would like to share what led me from being an ex-Muslim, ex-agnostic, and now Christian. I would like to share it because many have questioned me about my conversion, and I had to keep repeating the same story. I still get questions from Redditors about my conversion, and therefore, I am sharing it tonight. Not sure if anyone will read this or even care. It sure is long though!!

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in an Islamic household with amazing, passionate parents who have devoted their entire life for the betterment of mine. My family came here to American from absolutely nothing for my brother and me to have absolutely everything; education, finances, healthcare, etc. Growing up, my family consistently made me memorize daily prayers, learn Arabic to read the Quran, attend mosques, etc. They did not force me to do these things; however, they were always disappointed when I did not. So, for the sake of their happiness, I would try to pray (did not last long) and recite the Quran (have done so x 3 times in my lifetime). However, despite having the prayers memorized, I did not know what they translated to. And, despite reciting the Quran x 3 times, I did not know what I was reading. Both these things were in Arabic, and I only knew how to read Arabic NOT understand it. But, growing up, I was told that these things would give me a seat in Heaven, and therefore, I should do them. But, I wanted something more. I did not care about Heaven, I cared about God. I wanted to know God. I wanted to be on fire for God. It was God I wanted, not Heaven.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, all these things that I did, did not draw me closer to Allah. I did not do them often; however, even when I did do them, I did not feel any form of emotional connection. I felt absolutely nothing. Therefore, I decided that these things did not matter, and I could simply continue living life praying to Allah by talking to him. Thus, I talked to Allah every day, all day. For as long as I could remember, maybe since high school, I was consistently talking to Allah. However, for as long as I could remember, I lived with complete doubt, hopelessness, anger, and frustration. You see, I was someone who was dying inside to have a connection with God. I was so thirsty to know him. I wanted him so badly, and I felt completely betrayed because no matter how much I prayed, I felt empty.

&amp;#x200B;

My prayers and daily conversations with God felt hollow. They felt broken, unheard, and wasteful. I was in this constant struggle because I wanted to believe in something greater than I, there must be. But, Allah never answered me. I was so agonized by my thirst for God that I became suicidal and hopeless. I was consistently crying during my conversations, begging Allah to give me SOMETHING. Give me a sign, even the smallest. Give me a dream, give me some form of connection. Help me to find you, please. I wondered how could Allah leave me in this trembling state of abandonment? Did he not love me?

&amp;#x200B;

I soon grew anger and resentment towards Allah, but I still ‚Äò‚Äôbelieved‚Äô‚Äô in him regardless of how hollow I felt. However, my anger was stronger. Each time something did not go my way, the blame was Allah. I would be quick to shift responsibility when things would go wrong. If I received a B+ in class, it was Allah‚Äôs fault. If I got into an argument with my parents, it was Allah‚Äôs fault. I would curse Allah, and I would throw my frustration at him. I would tell him I hate him, and then hours later, cry and beg for forgiveness only to do it again the next day. I realized later on that I had no respect for Allah, nor did I truly fear Allah‚Ä¶ Nor did I love Allah. I wanted to love Allah to the deepest of my core, but there was nothing there. I also realized how much of an envious, lustful, uncaring, angered individual I was. However, I lived my life knowing that Allah would forgive me if I continued to do good deeds over bad ones. I could continue doing all the bad that I could do as long as I did more good things‚Ä¶ And this destroyed me even more because deep down, I always questioned whether I was a decent human being. How could Allah be proud of me? I wasn‚Äôt proud of myself. How could Allah love me? I did not love me. How could Allah say that this woman belongs in Heaven? I was not a good enough person to belong there.

&amp;#x200B;

After 21 years, I gave up on Islam. I could not believe in Allah anymore. I felt no connection. I felt detached and broken, and I knew that praying to Allah would not get me anymore. Therefore, I decided to just believe that there was a greater being who created me and all of the universe. At first, it was scary. I was so used to saying I was Muslim to everyone who asked about my religion that at times, I would hesitate. I also was so afraid because of my whole life, I had believed Allah was God. I also knew that my family would be disappointed and disown me if they ever found out I had left Islam. It took me several months to be open about me leaving this faith to coworkers and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I quickly realized that I felt no different than how I felt when I was believing in Allah. Merely believing in a higher being was doing nothing for me. I felt the same brokenness and hollowness that I felt when I prayed to Allah. I felt the same anger and anguish that I had felt when I prayed to Allah. If there was a higher being out there that created me, I still had no respect for them and would curse them when things did not go my way. Nothing changed. And yet, I continued to believe that there was a higher being despite all these things.

&amp;#x200B;

A year goes by, and my close friend pressured me into reading about Jesus. I told my friend that I would never believe in Jesus Christ ever. I only knew of Jesus, because I grew up in America, and many people followed him. I did not know if he was God, or simply a son of God, or just a person. I knew nothing, but I refused to follow him. I told my friend that I promise him I would never believe in Jesus Christ. I knew nothing of the Bible, or what Christianity was about. But, within that same week of arguing with my friend and telling my friend that I would never believe, I laid in my bed, crossed my hands together, and prayed, saying something along the lines of:

    Dear God, I don‚Äôt know what exactly to believe. I have felt so lost and incomplete for so long. I have no guidance or direction of where to go. I am tired of this brokenness. If you are out there, please just give me a sign of where to go.

&amp;#x200B;

During that same night, I had a dream of me praying on a tree-stump in front of a river. Funny thing was, the same prayer I had prayed that night, was the same prayer I prayed in my dream. Once the prayer was finished in my dream, a bright light surrounded me as I said ‚Äò‚ÄôJesus.‚Äô‚Äô

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this meant something to me. However, I was still not fully convinced. The same week, I began to cry. I began to cry because I partially believed in Jesus, but my other half was afraid. After reading a few things, I realized that to follow Jesus, I had to give up on a lot of things. Many of these things were my sins, which I believed were ingrained in me and were a part of who I was. I was an envious, lustful person. I lied almost daily. I had a habit of these things, and I truly thought that I could never give my life to Christ because I could never stray away from these things. The same night I was crying, I had another dream:

&amp;#x200B;

    In this dream, I saw a statue of Jesus Christ. It was that simple, just Jesus Christ. The rest of the area was pitch black. And in that dream, I heard someone say in the background, ‚Äò‚ÄôHow much do you love my Son?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

That was it. This was the one dream that truly moved me. I want to also emphasize the fact that it was not just the dream that moved me toward Christ. But, I also felt a connectedness I had never felt before. I had felt a love I had never felt before. You see, for 22 years, I had sought an answer from both Allah and simply a ‚Äò‚Äôhigh-being.‚Äô‚Äô For 22 years, I had felt empty and detached. For 22 years, I was just so desperate to finding something to give my life purpose and meaning. However, no matter how much I prayed before, I had never felt what I felt when I gave my life to Jesus Christ. All this in a week, and all this the same week I had repeatedly told my friend that I would never believe in Christ. I ate my own words.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, before, I continued to believe that if I did the right things, I could also do the wrong things. What was bad about this? It destroyed me. My enviousness destroyed me. How could I claim to care for my friends, but then not hope the best for them? My lustfulness destroyed me. How could I love my boyfriend, yet think of other men in the back of my mind? My lying destroyed me. How could I claim that others loved me when whom they loved was just a phony image I created? My greediness destroyed me. How could I be thankful for what I have, while wishing I had what others did? All these things strayed me away from being like Christ: holy, good, love, peace, forgiveness‚Ä¶ And, they ruined me. They made me second-guess who I was as a person. I hated me.

&amp;#x200B;

Islam had taught me that it was okay to continue being a sinner, even if it involved killing my soul and who I was completely. Almost as if it is okay to be a drug addict until it ruins you and destroys every relation you have with the ones you love.

&amp;#x200B;

 How could I ever be proud of who I am as a human being if I could never fix the underlying problems that were me? Why would I even care to change them if ‚Äò‚ÄôGod‚Äô‚Äô did not care? I had no motivation to change because nothing required me to changed. I was not strong enough to change myself, and Allah did not expect me to change myself...

&amp;#x200B;

But, Jesus cares. Jesus wants me to be better. He expects me to be better. And, he loves me enough to help me to be better. And this led me to my final thing... I learned to love myself. I learned to better myself. Every day, I try to sin less than I did the day before. It is not easy, and I fail multiple times... But the simple desire to change has significantly impacted the way I view myself as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

And, unfortunately, I do not have all the answers. A few years ago, if someone told me this exact story, I still would not believe in Christ Jesus. Plenty of atheists and other religious individuals point out valid arguments and questions that I simply do not know the answer to. And sometimes, even I have my doubts, and I ask questions on here that I do not find satisfying answers to.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot tell you why people suffer. I cannot tell you why children have cancer. I cannot tell you if there is evidence for Christ. I am sorry. These are all questions that I also wished I had answers to, but I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ And I am naive, and therefore, I am also not the best person to ask. But I am now content in my faith, something I have been longing for more than I had ever longed for anything in my lifetime. What I feel is real, a true sense of love. At times, I even cry in my car while driving home, because of the immense peace and love that I feel from my Lord‚Ä¶ This was something I never envisioned myself having. I am truly in a better place knowing that what I have sought so long has been received. I can only pray that those who long the same, will one day receive it as well. Peace to you all my brothers and sisters in Christ. And, love one another just as Christ loved you.",1,"Ex-Muslim, Ex-Agnostic, now Christian.",212.0,0.97,"Ex-Muslim, Ex-Agnostic, now Christian.

A year goes by, and my close friend pressured me into reading about Jesus. I told my friend that I would never believe in Jesus Christ ever. I only knew of Jesus, because I grew up in America, and many people followed him. I did not know if he was God, or simply a son of God, or just a person. I knew nothing, but I refused to follow him. I told my friend that I promise him I would never believe in Jesus Christ. I knew nothing of the Bible, or what Christianity was about. But, within that same week of arguing with my friend and telling my friend that I would never believe, I laid in my bed, crossed my hands together, and prayed, saying something along the lines of:

    Dear God, I don‚Äôt know what exactly to believe. I have felt so lost and incomplete for so long. I have no guidance or direction of where to go. I am tired of this brokenness. If you are out there, please just give me a sign of where to go.

&amp;#x200B;

During that same night, I had a dream of me praying on a tree-stump in front of a river. Funny thing was, the same prayer I had prayed that night, was the same prayer I prayed in my dream. Once the prayer was finished in my dream, a bright light surrounded me as I said ‚Äò‚ÄôJesus.‚Äô‚Äô

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this meant something to me. However, I was still not fully convinced. The same week, I began to cry. I began to cry because I partially believed in Jesus, but my other half was afraid. After reading a few things, I realized that to follow Jesus, I had to give up on a lot of things. Many of these things were my sins, which I believed were ingrained in me and were a part of who I was. I was an envious, lustful person. I lied almost daily. I had a habit of these things, and I truly thought that I could never give my life to Christ because I could never stray away from these things. The same night I was crying, I had another dream:

&amp;#x200B;

    In this dream, I saw a statue of Jesus Christ. It was that simple, just Jesus Christ. The rest of the area was pitch black. And in that dream, I heard someone say in the background, ‚Äò‚ÄôHow much do you love my Son?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

That was it. This was the one dream that truly moved me. I want to also emphasize the fact that it was not just the dream that moved me toward Christ. But, I also felt a connectedness I had never felt before. I had felt a love I had never felt before. You see, for 22 years, I had sought an answer from both Allah and simply a ‚Äò‚Äôhigh-being.‚Äô‚Äô For 22 years, I had felt empty and detached. For 22 years, I was just so desperate to finding something to give my life purpose and meaning. However, no matter how much I prayed before, I had never felt what I felt when I gave my life to Jesus Christ. All this in a week, and all this the same week I had repeatedly told my friend that I would never believe in Christ. I ate my own words.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, before, I continued to believe that if I did the right things, I could also do the wrong things. What was bad about this? It destroyed me. My enviousness destroyed me. How could I claim to care for my friends, but then not hope the best for them? My lustfulness destroyed me. How could I love my boyfriend, yet think of other men in the back of my mind? My lying destroyed me. How could I claim that others loved me when whom they loved was just a phony image I created? My greediness destroyed me. How could I be thankful for what I have, while wishing I had what others did? All these things strayed me away from being like Christ: holy, good, love, peace, forgiveness‚Ä¶ And, they ruined me. They made me second-guess who I was as a person. I hated me.

&amp;#x200B;

Islam had taught me that it was okay to continue being a sinner, even if it involved killing my soul and who I was completely. Almost as if it is okay to be a drug addict until it ruins you and destroys every relation you have with the ones you love.

&amp;#x200B;

 How could I ever be proud of who I am as a human being if I could never fix the underlying problems that were me? Why would I even care to change them if ‚Äò‚ÄôGod‚Äô‚Äô did not care? I had no motivation to change because nothing required me to changed. I was not strong enough to change myself, and Allah did not expect me to change myself...

&amp;#x200B;

But, Jesus cares. Jesus wants me to be better. He expects me to be better. And, he loves me enough to help me to be better. And this led me to my final thing... I learned to love myself. I learned to better myself. Every day, I try to sin less than I did the day before. It is not easy, and I fail multiple times... But the simple desire to change has significantly impacted the way I view myself as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

And, unfortunately, I do not have all the answers. A few years ago, if someone told me this exact story, I still would not believe in Christ Jesus. Plenty of atheists and other religious individuals point out valid arguments and questions that I simply do not know the answer to. And sometimes, even I have my doubts, and I ask questions on here that I do not find satisfying answers to.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot tell you why people suffer. I cannot tell you why children have cancer. I cannot tell you if there is evidence for Christ. I am sorry. These are all questions that I also wished I had answers to, but I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ And I am naive, and therefore, I am also not the best person to ask. But I am now content in my faith, something I have been longing for more than I had ever longed for anything in my lifetime. What I feel is real, a true sense of love. At times, I even cry in my car while driving home, because of the immense peace and love that I feel from my Lord‚Ä¶ This was something I never envisioned myself having. I am truly in a better place knowing that what I have sought so long has been received. I can only pray that those who long the same, will one day receive it as well. Peace to you all my brothers and sisters in Christ. And, love one another just as Christ loved you.",ex muslim ex agnostic christian walk god challenge long would like share lead ex muslim ex agnostic christian would like share many question conversion

Not really my thing but I'm supportive


I commented on a post a day or so back about /r/atheism being a fast rising subreddit.

I am in most ways an atheist. I don't believe in god, I believe when we die there is nothing, I believe that good and evil aren't acts of god or satan, but more acts of the individual or circumstance.

That all said, I put across my viewpoints in the post and was open to a good discussion without name calling or the general hate we all see across reddit when someone shares a different view..

I was aware that I was in 'Your house' so to speak. I was arguing against the majority (as a non believer in a christianity subreddit) and I was fully prepared to be called names, to be told I was an idiot, to be labelled a bad person, to be chastised etc etc..

But I wasn't.

I entered into a great discussion and was pleasantly surprised with the user I was talking to (Thanks again /u/Broccoli-Robby).

It doesn't stop there though. I read through the other comments, from people with various beliefs and backgrounds and opinions, and for the most part I found similar interactions in the comments.

They did not want to hear that God would give miraculous preference to Gentiles over Jews. Why would God be doing something miraculous somewhere else and not with the elect?  They didn't like that perhaps Jesus was saying they would get skipped too. He saw something in them and Matthew sheds some light on what it was:

May we not adhere to doctrines that let us feel ok about **our** lack of faith and that cause us to crush self-righteously anyone who hints at any supernaturality. And may we not lead others down that same path of unbelief. Lord help us.

The following point is about those who do have faith that God still works, yet still haven't seen the supernatural. C.S. Lewis wrote in his book on Miracles:

""You are probably quite right in thinking that you will never see a miracle done: \[. . .\] They come on great occasions: they are found at the great ganglions of history‚Äînot of political or social history, but of that spiritual history which cannot be fully known by men. If your own life does not happen to be near one of those ganglions, how should you expect to see one? If we were heroic missionaries, apostles, or martyrs, it would be a different matter. But why you or I? Unless you live near a railway, you will not see trains go past your windows. How likely is it that you or I will be present when a peace-treaty is signed, when a great scientific discovery is made, when a dictator commits suicide? That we should see a miracle is even less likely. Nor, if we understand, shall we be anxious to do so. ‚ÄúNothing almost sees miracles but misery.‚Äù Miracles and martyrdoms tend to bunch about the same areas of history‚Äîareas we have naturally no wish to frequent.""

He talked about our natural tendency to avoid those levels of commitment where miracles are taking place. But even a bright mind like his did not dare to dismiss the supernatural as something that has ceased. He was humble enough to recognize that perhaps he just wasn't involved enough.

HownTomfi,0.0,209.0,"Merry Christmas, brethren,

I write to you in order to express my deeply confounded stress and confusion when it comes to the matter of religion, spirituality and God.

For years during my youth I would question everything, and I believe that questioning everything is a GOOD THING. However, I was seeking for answers in dark places. I eventually turned my back against God and Jesus. I would even go as far as to make fun of the entire concept of there being a divine Creator of the Universe.

Slowly, this lack of faith drove me to find answers in places that are there for the sole purpose to lead people astray.

Yes, you end up ""feeling good"", but the problem with that is that you end up believing in a myriad of logical inconsistencies and believing in an amalgamation of many different religions and philosophies. And while I personally believe reading up on different religions is a net-positive (in particular all 3 major Abrahamic religions), at the end of the day, you have to decide which one resonates with you the most.

I've had a hard life-- to the point where I did not know what was up, or down, and New Age/Atheism did not save me from having constant headaches from trying to figure out everything.

My life has led me through some hard and difficult tribulations-- the final straw for me was when my life was in immediate danger. What led me to leave atheism behind, and start reconsidering my faith in Christianity, was when my life was at stake. As an atheist, I thought, perhaps God can save me. In a break of tears, I decided to give out a heartfelt, and genuine prayer. I prayed to God, and called upon St. Michael to guide me and to provide me with safety-- to protect me from the enemy plotting to cause me harm.

It was at that moment that I saw a sign-- clear as day. As I stopped my crying, and I opened my eyes immediately after praying to God and St. Michael, I saw an orb of shining blue light, hovering in my living room. It hovered across my living room, and landed on the kitchen table, right above a red towel. I was in awe over what I had witnessed. Needless to say, it seems to have worked, and my life was not in danger soon after the prayer.

But that journey that began in that moment in time did not immediately lead me to Christ. I spent years searching explanations to what I had witnessed, resorting to finding New Age descriptions of the Archangel Michael, believing that yes, while I may have seen (or what I think I had seen) Michael the Archangel, sadly, to me it was not enough to return to the grace of Christ, God's only begotten son.

It took me a long time to internalize and accept that what I had seen, perhaps I will never be able to properly explain. But you know what? Perhaps that was the point of the entire experience. To show me that, no, I will never have all the answers. And that is OK. I accept that I am not a gatekeeper of Truth.

It has taken me a long, long time to finally get back to accepting the Holy Trinity as One. I believe this is a perfect time to begin my transition to becoming a devout follower and student of Christ.

I apologize for the extremely long post. It is the night after Christmas, and I have purchased my first KJV Study Bible to begin my spiritual journey as a Christian.

Merry Christmas, brethren,

I write to you in order to express my deeply confounded stress and confusion when it comes to the matter of religion, spirituality and God.

For years during my youth I would question everything, and I believe that questioning everything is a GOOD THING. However, I was seeking for answers in dark places. I eventually turned my back against God and Jesus. I would even go as far as to make fun of the entire concept of there being a divine Creator of the Universe.

I just wanted to share my story so skeptics can maybe change their minds and bring more people to Jesus.

Iam 25 years old and I was atheist until last year, I watched a video of Hugh Ross talking about how science continue to prove the existence of a God.

Really impressed with the arguments before going to sleep I asked sincerely : God if you are real show me a sign.

I rarely remember my dreams but I remember this one incredibly well and it felt so real.
I ended up in a plane crash, I knew I was going to die and I was really scared.

doomedson,0.0,199.0,"Before I became a Christian, I dabbled in the occult when I was younger. My family was Christian in culture, but this faded from us for varying reasons.

I stepped away and became more atheistic as time went on. Before long I had slipped from an agnostic to an atheist. With this in mind I began to explore other religions, finding them more interesting than serious. Something to explore along a fictional guidelines. I became a Levayan satanist in an ‚Äúedgy, gothic, sithlord wearing black‚Äù sort of way. Not believing that the religion was more than a mascot for atheism. 

I later met other satanists when I joined the military, realized it was a horrible movement with no actual ideas that worked out for other human beings. It was at this time I began looking into Christianity more and I gradually found my way back to it. Even to the dismay of those within the metal community I frequented. 

gradually overtime and through many hard battles fought my way back to Christ. I still struggle here and there with certain aspects of myself.

Nonetheless... I wanted to share an experience I dreamed from many months ago. It was an alarming experience and when I woke up I was a bit shaken. It was short... but wow. Just... wow.

That day I sort of.... ‚Äúfelt a temptation‚Äù to relive my older ways. The band ‚ÄúImpaled Nazarene‚Äù (Russian Black Metal band) kept coming to me to listen to. I fought the urge over and over again. Yet... I knew not to do this. I fought back against it and felt the ‚Äúpsychic push‚Äù over it all. 

Later that day I went to sleep. 

The dream was in several parts. I don‚Äôt recall the sequence of the first sets within the dream, but I recall the final act of it.

Within the dream I was in first person. My own soul contained within my own body. No subconscious images or strange memories in random chaos. When it began, I was in a wooded area, a park bench beneath me. Surrounding me were several children. I don‚Äôt remember their faces exactly besides the little Hispanic girl to my immediate left. I think she had glasses on. 

We were sitting there in normalcy and then suddenly one of them yelled ‚ÄúQuick! RUN!‚Äù All we all rose from the benches and ran towards the building that was to my immediate left. We ran up the hill and rested on the sidewalk/door area.

From where we were sitting was an open path behind us. It sort of led out into the forest. There was a streetlight above where we were. From out of the forest, walked a man. Long, blond hair, beautifully combed. Leather jacket (sort of like Emperor and Euronymous from the 90‚Äôs black metal scene).... silent and slowly stalking stride. I‚Äôm not joking... it was creepy. The look in his eyes was beyond disturbed. Serial killer energy. Like he was deeply angry at the fact that I didn‚Äôt follow through with his psychic suggestion from Sheol. Again.... beautiful and model like... but highly disturbing. 

He was wearing an Impaled Nazarene shirt in the dream. I can‚Äôt post the image here... but the band logo is exactly the same.

Amen.",1,"Former satanist/occultist, now Christian. I wish to share a dream I had from about a year ago.",199.0,0.96,"Former satanist/occultist, now Christian. I wish to share a dream I had from about a year ago. Before I became a Christian, I dabbled in the occult when I was younger. My family was Christian in culture, but this faded from us for varying reasons.

I stepped away and became more atheistic as time went on. Before long I had slipped from an agnostic to an atheist. With this in mind I began to explore other religions, finding them more interesting than serious. Something to explore along a fictional guidelines. I became a Levayan satanist in an ‚Äúedgy, gothic, sithlord wearing black‚Äù sort of way. Not believing that the religion was more than a mascot for atheism. 

I later met other satanists when I joined the military, realized it was a horrible movement with no actual ideas that worked out for other human beings. It was at this time I began looking into Christianity more and I gradually found my way back to it. Even to the dismay of those within the metal community I frequented. 

gradually overtime and through many hard battles fought my way back to Christ. I still struggle here and there with certain aspects of myself.

Nonetheless... I wanted to share an experience I dreamed from many months ago. It was an alarming experience and when I woke up I was a bit shaken. It was short... but wow. Just... wow.

That day I sort of.... ‚Äúfelt a temptation‚Äù to relive my older ways. The band ‚ÄúImpaled Nazarene‚Äù (Russian Black Metal band) kept coming to me to listen to. I fought the urge over and over again. Yet... I knew not to do this. I fought back against it and felt the ‚Äúpsychic push‚Äù over it all. 

Later that day I went to sleep. 

The dream was in several parts. I don‚Äôt recall the sequence of the first sets within the dream, but I recall the final act of it.

Within the dream I was in first person. My own soul contained within my own body. No subconscious images or strange memories in random chaos. When it began, I was in a wooded area, a park bench beneath me. Surrounding me were several children. I don‚Äôt remember their faces exactly besides the little Hispanic girl to my immediate left. I think she had glasses on. 

We were sitting there in normalcy and then suddenly one of them yelled ‚ÄúQuick! RUN!‚Äù All we all rose from the benches and ran towards the building that was to my immediate left. We ran up the hill and rested on the sidewalk/door area.

From where we were sitting was an open path behind us. It sort of led out into the forest. There was a streetlight above where we were. From out of the forest, walked a man. Long, blond hair, beautifully combed. Leather jacket (sort of like Emperor and Euronymous from the 90‚Äôs black metal scene).... silent and slowly stalking stride. I‚Äôm not joking... it was creepy. The look in his eyes was beyond disturbed. Serial killer energy. Like he was deeply angry at the fact that I didn‚Äôt follow through with his psychic suggestion from Sheol. Again.... beautiful and model like... but highly disturbing. 

He was wearing an Impaled Nazarene shirt in the dream. I can‚Äôt post the image here... but the band logo is exactly the same.

The dream ended right there. I woke up and just sort of dwelt on it.

Yeah.... satanic, 4th dimensional attacks are real guys. Stay on guard. The Lord and Christ protect us through dreams even to this very day and ward us away from evil. Guard yourselves.

JpBlez5,0.0,199.0,"Maybe it‚Äôs because you were exposed to porn or sexual impure things for the first time when you were young, or even taken advantage of as a child or adult. When this occurs, we‚Äôre wounded,‚Äù emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. When we‚Äôre wounded we get a distorted view of God‚Äôs gift of sex, leading us to seeking the trill of sexual sin, then afterwards feeling shame and guilt. You‚Äôre not dealing with a lust issue, but a wound that has not healed yet.

Remember that we‚Äôre all warriors of God, and are meant to fight and advance his kingdom. But even warriors sometimes stumble and lose focus, due to the lustful distractions from the devil, While we‚Äôre intended to fight for his kingdom, the devil can use lustful distraction to force us off the path God has for us. So how do we get back on the path God has for us? So here‚Äôs some tips on how to stop this sin.

 1. Confess to God how to deal with guilt: 
God is faithful and just to focus if we confess. Confess for forgiveness. But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠1:9‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨. This sin grows in the dark. Even if we try to hide this sin from god, not only does he already know about it, but it says in the Bible that in the end all things will be brought to the light. But when we allow the  light of the lord is shined on this sin, and invite him to help us, the light will overcome the dark, and the darkness can never overcome it. So confess and repent of this sin now. Why would you wait to fight a future battle that you could beat through Christ now?

‚ÄúThe light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠1:5‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

2.  How to handle guilt: 
Guilt and self pity is a ploy by the devil to keep you away from God. When we feel guilty or self pity, it is a form of self punishment, used to make ourselves feel like we‚Äôre punishing ourselves. When you do this, instead of focusing on the free gift of salvation God gave us, all you focus on is yourself, and punishing yourself. Remember Jesus died you we didn‚Äôt have to face any punishment for sin, but that we could be free from sin. so stand up brother and accept his forgiveness and repent, for you have been forgiven. 

‚ÄúOh but I‚Äôve done it so much‚Äù,or ‚Äúmy sin is to great‚Äù. This doesn‚Äôt mean a thing. Jesus defeated sin and death on the cross. Neither then or now can any of these things compare to the name of Jesus. You sin may be big, but your God is bigger. Goliath was big, but God was bigger. Also Jesus is faithful to forgive us of our trespasses as many times as we need to be forgiven of them( this doesn‚Äôt however excuse you from not repenting, for Gods kindness is intended to lead us to repentance, from Romans 2:4).


3. Confess to the right people: James tell us to confess our sins to one another, and when we do this, we have healing. Iron sharpens iron as a friend sharpens a friend( Proverbs 27:17). We don‚Äôt just need our bride, we need fellow men or women, people who can keep us accountable.  and when we do this, we have healing. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.  Let‚Äôs not neglect the impact of talking to each other, sharpening each other, and talking about our sins to each other, which will bring healing. This sin grows best in the dark, especially in the darkness of unaccountability and away from God. Sometimes that accountability can make us have more urgency to not fall. If You need to go to rehab, counseling, marriage counseling, you gotta do what you gotta do.

4. Know your triggers: If you continue to fall on the same path, get off the path. If it‚Äôs an app you scroll that makes you fall stop looking at it. If it‚Äôs you being alone in your room, or something you‚Äôre reading, etc, cut off all the things that make you fall. Jesus said if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. That‚Äôs how serious we need to treat this sin. If something causes us to trip, get rid of it. We can‚Äôt make lustful thoughts just stop. You‚Äôre  always potential vulnerable to this sin. Satan will place land mines for us, and we must be wise and honest enough to know our triggers and avoid them. We have to be honest with ourselves about what triggers us, and work around them and allow God to help us. Always be weary of the enemy, for he,s like a roaring lion, he crawls around like a lion waiting to devour someone. A lion never attacks prey that can resist its fangs and avoid its traps, and likewise if we resist and avoid the devils attacks, he‚Äôll leave us alone( ‚ÄúSo humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.‚Äù James‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4:7‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Never feel entitled to sin because others do it, and never feel overconfident or feel you don‚Äôt need to follow your triggers. You‚Äôre only making yourself more vulnerable. You‚Äôre leaving the door wide open for temptation to swept you away a storm. You‚Äôre only as strong as you are honest.

5. Let God heal the wound: Like I said earlier  You‚Äôre not dealing with a lust issue, but a wound that has not healed yet. This fight won‚Äôt be easy, we may fight it our whole lives, but in Christ there‚Äôs freedom, joy, true sexual intimacy, true intimacy with your spouse, and true love. Warriors, you‚Äôre not weak, your not a victim, you deny yourself and make sacrifices, you never surrender. The only thing we have to and need to surrender to is God who promises to guide us through this fight. You can do all things through him who gives you strength. If you need healing, go to him who heals all wounds. If you need to surrender to God, surrender yourself and this sin to him who shows mercy. Your head is a battle field, you are the commander of your mind, not a slave of it. The same spirit that rose Christ from the grave is in you. You may stumble yeah, you rise up anyway. A warrior may not win every battle, but they don‚Äôt stop fighting. This sin has no hold on you. Through the freedom and victory from Christ‚Äôs sacrifice, victory is yours.

‚ÄúHe heals the brokenhearted and bandages their wounds.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Psalms‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠147:3‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨


‚ÄúNo, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.‚Äù

My entire teen life I was into the supernatural, ghost hunting, magic, occult, etc. as I aged I became an atheist because I thought ‚Äúi am a hospice nurse and I‚Äôve never seen a ghost. This must be bullsh ‚Äú Also all those science courses and fellow peers got me feeling stupid for believing in God. So I rejected Christians as brainwashed, uneducated. (sound familiar? Thats the sound of Reddit saying that to us. I believed it, until the unexplainable happened)

I‚Äôve been through a lot. Alcoholic dad died when I was 22 (the day before my birthday), mom is homeless since he died (still homeless to this day, years later ) and my brother and 4 year old son both got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I also totaled my car I didn‚Äôt pay off. So at work one of my patients died, and I was sitting alone at my desk flipping through Genesis (there are a lot of books at the nursing home, I just chose the Bible this time out of heartbreak I was humbled I started a new) ‚Äúwhat do I know?‚Äù I asked myself. Nothing. Life NEVER goes my way. But sometimes it does... my brother and son did not die from DKA (both were found in comas with blood sugars over 1000, my son almost died and they both spend time in their respective ICU)

So I‚Äôm reading genesis, not really thinking when I just start crying as I recognized the Bible as the truth for the first time in 28 years. I can‚Äôt explain this, but I knew what I was reading is true. It's like God put a new brain inside my head at that moment. ALL of the judgement of christians and those immature atheist ideas died in that moment of humility. It‚Äôs the knowing... that was the Holy Spirit. Then I was convicted of my sin, and I repented. BRO I DIDNT KNOW WHAT THESE MEANT UNTIL AFTER IT HAPPENED TO ME! I had to look up ‚Äúbeing reborn‚Äù and I finally put words like ‚Äúconviction‚Äù and ‚Äúrepent‚Äù with my story. It began to make a clear picture. I was born again at work, out of no where. I was 28 and broken. But as a nurse I‚Äôve been serving god without even giving him credit. None of my good works mattered since I didn‚Äôt see Christ. But now I am FREE!! A lifetime of atheism, hopelessness and pain- FREE! I WILL SEE MY DAD AGAIN! My husband is still an atheist, and is confused how I was ""saved out of nowhere"". I think God had his eye on me for a LONG time. and he was workin on me! AMEN!!!!!

AbelHydroidMcFarland,0.0,189.0,"‚ÄúSuppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one's first feeling, 'Thank God, even they aren't quite so bad as that,' or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we shall insist on seeing everything -- God and our friends and ourselves included -- as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.‚Äù",1,A CS Lewis quote for both sides of the political aisle when dealing with the other side of the aisle,189.0,0.95,"A CS Lewis quote for both sides of the political aisle when dealing with the other side of the aisle ‚ÄúSuppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper.

I had him look up ephesians 1:4 in his mom's bible, mine was in my work bag in the car.  I said think about that, God made us with no fault in his eyes.  Couple minutes pass and he says, I have a hard time believing in God. I asked him why and he says, how can you believe a book that is so old and been translated so many times.  I showed him our dictionary and how it had an addendum with words that have been added to it over the years, I explain that language evolves and that the bible has been translated over generations so each generation can understand it in their language.

From what I gather by reading the gospels is that Jesus was a powerful man, that when he spoke people listened. They listened because his message was powerful. He walked through this earth leaving people stunned and in awe of him and the miracles he performed, everywhere he went.

When Jesus fed the 5,000 men (even more including women and children) with 2 fish and 5 loaves of bread, he had to be ushered away because the people wanted to take him by force and make him a king.

There was not one that came in contact with Jesus whose life wasn‚Äôt immediately changed. This man was so powerful that the kings who ruled over all were threatened by him.

kaguragamer,0.0,179.0,"Let me tell you a bit of my backstory, i was raised a Protestant by my parents and entire family since young. I went to church regularly and didnt make much of it honestly. I believed in God but I didnt deem these weekly sessions necessary as I was young and didnt understand much and so my parents gave a very twisted and exaggerated teaching to me about ""God's laws"" and pretty much said that unless i followed them, I'm going to hell etc. I was scarred emotionally when my mother beat me up when I was 6, all i remember is that she was incensed because I for whatever reason didnt sing happy birthday and what followed was you know... Me crying.. Grandparents screaming and pounding at the door threatening to call child support or something if she didnt stop...

Fast forward when i was a teenager. During this time, I was more and more emotionally abused by my mother and literally I would have to listen to her rant everyday about how I was a useless kid who was a burden to my family, not contributing anything and I was good as dead. To add to the problem, I discovered that I was sexually attracted to people of the same gender, which in christianity as you know it is absolutely frowned upon. Being grown up in a household with both parents that are extremely homophobic and I dare say, racist towards different people just because they are black etc, i was absolutely destroyed by this and I more or less gave up my relationship with God. Why does God make me this way if he thinks its a sin? Why doesnt he change my mom? Why punish people and especially queer people to hell, didnt you make them or something why cant you just change these people if you are so powerful? I couldnt just forgive and forget 12 years where my mother basically shouted at me that I was useless 80 percent of the time while my dad just didnt know or didnt care, I couldnt just forgive the time where she told me to screw off once im 18 and that she wont give a fuck to whatever happens to me afterward. Luckily, I managed to go to boarding school back in Asia(We migrated to America when I was 14), and i wont hesitate to say that my life improved tremendously after that, at least my mental health.

During the time where I was away, I was able to do my own research and readings on the bible and the church, if you can call it that. The result was horrifying, child molestations, a church that branded women as whores simply because they cut their hair short, ""holy people"" or priests claiming to be closes to god but shaming people everywhere for literally every single act they commit and behind closed doors are an absolute dickhead that cheats on their wife and  does things they teach other people not to do. Of course these arent true for christians everywhere, but I am merely pointing this to show you that a lot of the times people have a very ugly view of christianity is because of the people who claim to be christians but actually just take God's words out of context and twists it to fit their own selfish intentions. I am disgusted of people such as these. I read the Bible many times and nowhere does it say to judge people based on their sexuality, nowhere inferring that you would go to hell just because you are black, nowhere does it say women should be treated as mere objects because they are inferior to men and a lot more what my parents and the christian community thought to me or what i took away from them when I was a child. Some churches care about its own reputation only and doesnt really care about troubled youths such as me who struggled with these kind of things when i was growing up. And all those christians who wrongfully claim that God told you that because you are a parent you can exercise whatever authority on their child and telling people they are condemmed to hell because they are a whore, please shut up. We people who do these are no better than the pharisees in the New testament. While Jesus ate and drank with people that are outcasts and women who have cheated on their husbands, these people didnt understand and insulted Jesus because he did these things. Christ doesnt teach us to drive people away from christianity and to not show any love for them just because they are horrible human beings. It teaches us to love them regardless whether they are gay or a lier etc... To hate the sin but to love the person. Easier said than done but you need to put it in practise.

I hope you all can understand. We people who call ourselves christians should act in the Lord's word and not be narrow minded as if we are the people who should judge other people about who will be saved and who wouldnt.  I have managed to live a good life and return to God and at the same time solve my own issues. I have to say that being a christian is really a privelege, though i still am not fond of the church. I am still struggling to forgive my parents for what they have done.....

Humility is one of the main characters that is required of a Christian. The Bible says in James 4:10 Humble thy self before the Lord and he will lift you up. Jesus was a man of great power, knowledge and wisdom but he was very humble.

One may ask what does it mean to be humble? It means you are confident in yourself, your talents and your skills, but you don‚Äôt go around showing off or trying to gain others‚Äô approval or applause. But it does not mean that we should deny our strengths and abilities. When asked if he was the Messiah, Jesus replied, ‚ÄúThe blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them.  And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me‚Äù Jesus did not brag about being the Messiah but in his reply one could tell he was the Messiah through the miraculous works he did.

Many may think this message is for those with wealth. Being poor does not guarantee humility.
The opposite of humility is pride. The Bible warns against proud people. Provebs 16:18 It says pride  goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. When we look at the outcomes of these characteristics we see one is positive the other very negative. 

As we go through this weekend let us be humble and if one had a spirit if pride let us pray that the Lord would have given you a spirit of humility.

Have a blessed weekend

regret-the-rapture,0.0,184.0,"This post isn't meant to start sh\*t nor is it meant as an attack on Christians. I used to be Christian and I just want a community I can confess this to since I nave no idea who would even be willing to listen. Tl;dr at the bottom for those who don't want to read much. Growing up, I was very much a Christian! I had love for Jesus and believed every word of the bible. Every Sunday was spent praising God and everyday in general would see me reading the bible front to back. I was born in 1994 and my dad was an avid follower of Dr. Mel Mulder and Harold Camping and as was I since it's all my dad allowed me to listen to. There were small things that got to me about him at first like how he would openly pray bad things happened to people he didn't like or him telling me boldly that he would murder me if God told him to but I paid it no mind since, as the bible said, honor thy father. It wasn't until 2009 that I noticed he had many books in his truck. All by Harold Camping and all detailed the supposed end of the world. I pried a bit and he told me the rapture was coming. I had always been told the rapture was coming but to be given such a clear 'we're close to this' look from him shook me to my core. This had me anxious and of course worried. Was I saved? Would Jesus spare me? I brought these concerns to my dad and he did not take well to it. He's by no means a very nice person but seeing his usual neutral scowl turn to an anger filled glare still sends chills down my spine. He didn't even say anything before yanking me by the arm, dragging me to the kitchen, and forcing me to read verses of the bible he felt conveyed whatever he wanted. Everyday he'd stop me in the middle of something and force me to read. I had loved reading the bible but now it felt...wrong. I was afraid. He'd scream at me and get so angry he'd start turning red. All i can hear from him was ""I'm not missing out on heaven because your little (slur for mentally disabled people) ass wants to be a (alternate name for a cat) so read you (slur for gay people)"". Everyday was a new screaming match and everyday was more anxiety about the rapture. Come 2010 and he started doing rapture drills. At exactly midnight every night he'd march me to the backyard and scream at me to confess my sins. If he felt i was lying or felt I sinned, he'd either beat me with his belt or hold me against the wall by my throat and scream in my face that Jesus hated me. Come 2011 and the rapture approaching, my father went into full paranoia mode. He'd count down the days to the rapture with excitement and glee saying how happy he was all the (slur for jewish people, black people, gay people, the mentally disabled, etc.) were gonna rot in hell and how Jesus would reward him personally. Months turned to weeks and weeks turned to days and days turned to hours as May 21st approached. May 21st finally arrived and my dad forced me into the living room bible in hand and began screaming ""JESUS IS COMING AMEN"" over and over and over for hours until day went into the night and soon it was the 22nd. All night we waited and nothing happened. We had nothing. My dad thrashed everything and none of the bills were paid and neither of us had jobs (I was unable to work due to my dad keeping a tight hold on me and he was in between jobs). I didn't know what to think but the deafening silence was broken by my dad tackling me to the ground and violently bludgeoning me. All he was saying was ""this is your fault!"" and ""jesus was supposed to reward me!"". I had to knee him in the stomach to get him off and I ran as fast as I could to the nearest house (We were living in California at the time in a very wide spread stretch of desert so the nearest house was quite far.) I don't remember much of what happened after this (likely due to head trauma) but what I do recall is my vision going blurry and waking up in the back of a squad car as my dad was being held down by 2 police officers. I had no immediate (or any really) family so was placed in foster care and that brings us to today...26 and living alone in Nebraska with nothing. I suffered permeant brain damage and now am unable to even speak properly or see clearly let alone hold down a job. My anxiety has only worsened and now...I don't know what happened to my faith. I tried turning to the church for help but I was shunned. Told I deserved it and that God was testing me. To be told my suffering was deserved cut deep... I just wanted this out. Thank you to anyone who listened.

Sure, one could be forgiven were he drawn to, say, Eastern Orthodoxy, what with the cool beards and the mesmerizing chants (don't get me wrong, I love the Eastern tradition), but Catholicism... ugh, right?

My father thinks I've gone crazy (""I believe in science!"" Me too, dad, me too: gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit). My wife is positively angry that I could, in her words, let myself be brainwashed. And her eyes gleam with such scorn and naked hate when she talks about prayer, the Rosary or the Saints, that sometimes I really do wonder if there might be something else, more sinister at play (perish the thought!)...

Not to convert them. But at least to make them pause.

After all, I am an educated guy, an intellectual bulimic with a Master's degree in Classics, or rather your average insufferable know-it-all history buff and languages nerd, a voracious reader of Old Boring Books (tm), AND a former militant atheist to boot.

Did I not desperately fight with all my pride against that conversion? Does this not register?

Turns out that no. It does not.

Christ made me see my pride and vanity, but I was not ready to see what others really thought about me. My opinion holds no sway after all. All glory to you, Lord! Have mercy upon me!

But what about the company I was now keeping, the countless thinkers, writers, artists and mystics that enriched our great tradition, do they not forbid one to  simply brand our faith as ""ignorant"" or ""obscurantist""? I would say: ""do you think Pascal or C.S. Lewis, Aquinas or Simone Weil are idiots? Do you think, we, in the West, stand on the shoulders of bigoted fools, all of them?""

I thought this made for a really strong case, at the very least, for the ""weight"" of the Christian outlook. At least, this is what always made me uneasy about my own triumphalist attitude towards the past. But maybe this simply is a question of humility? Dare I say of supernatural humility?

I remember when I was in high school I wanted to become a Christian, but at that time, it was more to escape what I felt was an oppressive religion (Islam), I didn't really have a deeper understanding of what it meant to be a Christian, or, specifically, a Catholic.

Now, a little more than ten years, later, our Lord God called me into questioning the Islamic faith and ultimately a journey into a walk with Christ. It was not easy at first, as I looked more into the questionable grounds on which the Islamic faith stood. I truly searched in earnest for support of the faith I had grown up in and loved. But as I searched deeper, I could not ignore reason and what was clear to me--Jesus Christ, our Lord, and what he has called onto us. I love my family, who are so important in my life, and it was so difficult for me to let go of what they have taught me and what they love. It still is, and I still haven't shared with them how I feel.

I'm someone who's always struggled with depression and anxiety, but as I've been praying the Rosary everyday and reading the Bible every day for the last few months--I can honestly say, I've never known more peace (to the point where I QUIT the toxic antidepressants and benzos I was on).

I still haven't gone through RCIA, as it's been a bit of a challenge to get in touch with my local parishes because of COVID. But nonetheless, I have been watching virtual mass, and loving it more and more every week, and I cannot wait to get baptized and officially become a Catholic.

* Stop procrastination

With the protests in Poland as well as the US election, I have seen an increase in online discussions on abortion. I'm a redditor in the United States in a highly Catholic area. Like most of you, I'm a devout Catholic. However, unlike the majority of those on this subreddit, I'm a mother in my thirties who personally knows a large number of women who have had abortions who have been willing to discuss them with me.

Most women who have had abortions are not going to be vocally pro-choice. They are not going to show up at protests with signs. They are not going to talk about their experience. So I'm going to share just a few of the stories of the women I know so that you can better understand them and see why some of the ways that Catholics currently work to end abortion are useful methods, and why some of the current methods are actually harmful to our cause.

Our Catholic high schools have an unwritten policy, that girls will be expelled if they are pregnant. I personally know three girls who became pregnant at my high school. One of them had an abortion, two of them gave birth to their children.

The girl who had an abortion was seventeen and convinced that her parents would disown her and throw her out of the house if they found out she'd had sex. She would be kicked out of school and left on her own. Her boyfriend, the father of the child, would also be kicked out of his all boys' Catholic school if she kept the child. She opted to terminate her pregnancy by taking the abortion pill and never told her family. She graduated high school with honors. She's now married with children and a practicing Catholic.

One girl who kept her baby was sixteen. Her boyfriend at the time pressured her to have sex and then afterwards called her a whore. He graduated from high school. His parents paid child support on his behalf. She was expelled from school (previously she had been an honor student) and was able to get her GED several years later. She initially considered abortion, but decided against it and was confident that her family would support her decision to keep the child. Her Catholic family supported her and the child.

One girl became pregnant shortly before graduation. She had planned to keep her pregnancy a secret but the school found out due to her weight gain. She was allowed to graduate, but not to appear at the graduation ceremony. She and her boyfriend did not marry, but they are both involved in the child's life and she went on to attend college. She gave up scholarships to attend universities out of state to stay close to family for childcare.

In college a friend of mine had an abortion. She and her fianc√© had been engaged for several months and were planning their wedding in the Church. She found out he'd been cheating on her with a mutual friend shortly before finding out that she was pregnant with his child. He left her for the mutual friend and wanted nothing to do with either her or their child. As it was still very early in the pregnancy, and she was distraught at the idea of being a single mother with no support she chose to abort the child. Years later, I asked her how she felt about her decision and she told me that she regretted the potential life that had ended, but still felt that death was a better option than the life that she would have been able to provide the child. A single mother at age nineteen with no support from family. She'd have been kicked out of campus housing at our Catholic university. Homeless and saddled with large amounts of student debt with no degree and no way to afford childcare to work, she thought it was kinder to let the child die than to face the abuse she'd seen a childhood friend of hers face in the U.S. adoption and foster care system.

Last year another friend of mine had an abortion. Her baby died in the womb at 28 weeks. She and her husband were heartbroken. They had already begun decorating the nursery. The child had a name and was loved. The Catholic hospital she was at would not remove the baby, despite there being no heartbeat. They gave her a referral to a local clinic that performed abortions where the baby could be removed. Her alternative, which they advocated for, was to carry the stillborn baby to term risking sepsis and dealing with the trauma of continuing a non-viable pregnancy for months. It was a deeply traumatic event for her, to lose a much loved and wanted baby, made even harder by having to walk through a crowd of pro-life protestors holding signs with dead babies on them. I've seen posts advocating the use of these same signs here in [r/Catholicism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/) and I beg you to please reconsider. She felt so unloved and condemned by those protesting outside the clinic and by the indifference of those at the hospital, that she credits their actions in large part to why she has now left the Catholic Church.

A friend of mine has four beautiful children. The last one was born premature. Her water broke far too early and due to low amniotic fluid the doctors had to perform a c-section. Technically, taking the baby this early would be considered an abortion under several of the laws currently being voted on in our country. Her boy was born healthy, following a procedure that very well may be illegal next week. I implore you, when looking at legislation on this topic and especially when being involved with the committees supporting and drafting anti-abortion legislation to consider the unintended consequences of it. Please ask your bishops to always have doctors and OBGYNs review the legislation that they are supporting to make sure that the measures don't hurt children by having overly broad language put in place by those who don't understand medical terminology.

The last story I'll leave you with is my own. I have not had an abortion, but did seriously consider having one. I never imagined that I would be in such a position. When I was pregnant with my first child, the doctor asked my husband and I if we would want to have our baby tested for down syndrome or other trisomies. We decided that there was no reason to have the test done because no matter what we would not consider an abortion and would love our child. It ended up being a high risk pregnancy due undiagnosed health problems on my part so we started having frequent ultrasounds. In one of the ultrasounds they detected choroid plexus cysts on her brain. These can be indicative of Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18), and given the risk factors in play and the way the ultrasound looked they suggested we have an amniocentesis to test for it. They warned us that if the test came back positive that given the position of everything they could see on the ultrasound that she would likely not survive. For babies that test positive there is a 95% chance that they die in the womb. Of babies that live, half of them die within the first week. Even if she lived, she'd be in pain facing a horrible death.

The two days between that ultrasound and the test results were some of the longest of my life. Due to recent changes in state law, we would have only days after the test results came back to decide whether or not we were going to abort the baby or carry her to term. I honestly did not know what I would do, if I could survive months of carrying a baby with ""deformities incompatible with life"". Because of the way the law was written, I would not have enough time for opportunity to sit and think and pray on this with my husband and our priest, to consult with other doctors, to get a possible second opinion on whether or not there was any way our baby could be viable. The decision would have to be made very quickly. Even if our baby died in my womb, I would have to carry her body until I became septic and the hospital would then consider an abortion as a medical emergency procedure. Thank God, the test came back negative and I never had to make that decision. It was in that moment of deep helplessness up against an artificial legal deadline, that I felt profound empathy with so many of the women in the pro-choice movement that I have argued against. It shook me to my core to realize that so many of the laws I supported that I believed would only preserve the life of children, could also force mothers to carry children long dead to term.

A quote from a pro-life activist that often circulated in pro-choice circles is ""There is a tremendous sadness and loneliness in the cry 'A woman's right to choose.' No one wants an abortion as she wants an ice-cream cone or a Porsche. She wants an abortion as an animal, caught in a trap, wants to gnaw off its own leg.""

So I'm asking all of you to please show mercy and understanding when engaging on this topic. Yes, be passionate but also be compassionate. For so many women, it's not a question of ""is it a baby?"" but ""would my baby be better off dead than in the life that I could provide?"". Support counseling, support bishops and legislators working with medical professionals in drafting proposals, support material assistance for unwed mothers, for poor mothers, for women in crisis. So much of the pro-life message is directed at teens and young women without realizing that these shock images of dead babies will often polarize people away from the pro-life cause and deeply wound families who have experienced miscarriages. Despite our archbishops urging to simply stand and pray, there are still those who attend pro-life marches and protests to scream at those on the other side.

Abortions are not uncommon. If you do not know anyone who has had one, I'd ask you to ask yourself why they aren't talking to you about it. How can you make love and forgiveness the centerpiece of your activism for life?

With everything going on, sounds like you all need a feel good story. So here is mine.

About 3 weeks ago, my father suffered a brain stem stroke in front of the emergency department, while going to visit my mother who was just admitted that morning for internal bleeding. He was somehow able to drive to the hospital, park the car, turn off the ignition and come out of the car before he stumbled and fell. A Good Samaritan found him and he was admitted to the hospital with signs of stroke. So here I am, an only child, with both my parents in the hospital. F\*\*k me, right?

For almost 10 days my dad lay in the ICU. He was not progressing at all and was paralyzed on his right side. He was dependent on a ventilator, his blood pressure skyrocketed, he was put on insulin for his diabetes and was on an obscene amount of sedatives and pain killers. This man, who snuck me wine coolers before my high school dances, took lonely seniors on casino runs and never missed a birthday/graduation/holiday for any of his grandchildren was lying down in a hospital bed fighting for his life. The times he was barely conscious, he cried. This is a man, in all my 44 years of life, has never cried.

His physician, at the time had written him off as being someone with a very 'low quality of life'. My father, an extremely vibrant man with a big mouth and an equally big heart, would likely never walk again and since he was not progressing, my mother and I made the very difficult decision to withdraw care in 48 hours. This was the most heartbreaking decision that I ever had to make. My kids saw me in the worst state of my life. My puppy (7 month old shihpoo) let me ugly cry into his fur. It was the worst week of my life.

Fast forward 48 hours later. My mom and I went to say our final goodbyes to my dad. We ran into our priest in the hospital who had just blessed my dad the day before (as we jokingly said that the only way to get him to be catholic was for him to be on his death bed). He mentioned how alert my father was. When we walked in to his room, the nurse said that he was watching TV. I mean, WTF, how is this man, who was in a vegetable state like 48 hours ago, watching T.V? We walked in to find my dad fully awake, off all sedatives, able to squeeze our hands and able to communicate by nodding his head. This was certainly NOT a man who was ready to die. The nurse then explained that he had progressed in the past 24 hours and that we could 'change our mind' with withdrawing end of care. We asked my dad if he was willing to try getting off the ventilator. We asked him if he was willing to fight the long battle ahead. He nodded yes, and squeezed out hand. I have since reported the doctor that told us that my father had no quality of life as she did not update us on our progress, and I can't help to think if they would have continued the end of life process had we not been able to visit him that day.

It's been two weeks since that life changing day in the ICU. My father has been progressing really well, able to fully move his left arm and leg, and occasionally, will stick his middle finger up at me and the nurse so at least we know he still has his sense off humour. He is completely off the ventilator and is undergoing physiotherapy. The doctors are amazed at his progress, stating that patients with his prognosis do not recover that quickly or, recover at all for that matter.

We are not sure what the future holds for my father, but I am so grateful that he is alive. And to see him flip the bird to me, is priceless.",0,"We were going to take my dad off life support, but God had other plans- Your feel good 'miracles' do happen true story for the day",1007.0,0.98,"We were going to take my dad off life support, but God had other plans- Your feel good 'miracles' do happen true story for the day

Gospel_of_Matthew,0.0,979.0,"Hello all! Thanks be to God I am officially Catholic!

I am a Convert to Catholicism; I was raised protestant (Non-Denominational) up until Highschool until I met my girlfriend (now fiancee!) my senior year who was Catholic. I would occasionally go to Mass with her family but I didn't really understand it and I wasn't a huge fan at first, but I still believed in God. My fiancee would pray for my conversion to Catholicism because she really wanted to get married in the church. A little over a year ago she went to NCYC and she prayed for my conversion more than ever and wasn't sure if we would stay together since I wasn't Catholic. Well I would end up stumbling across a documentary about Pope John Paul II on youtube while she was on her trip, and I became very inspired by his story. This led me to delve deeper into the faith and when she came back and I told her that we should watch the JPII documentary together and she was basically in tears. She knew her prayers had been answered, and soon after I would start RCIA and pick up a Catholic Bible. I would end up finishing the Bible a couple months before RCIA ended (I love scripture!) Which inspired me to pick St. Paul as my confirmation saint (Also my middle name is John, so having John Paul in my full name is a reminder of Pope John Paul II!) I just got confirmed and recieved holy communion for the first time today. I never really post on Reddit, but reading all the stuff you would post here helped me understand the faith better. The Catholic Church has helped me become much more involved in the Christian faith. Thank you all for helping me out on my journey and I hope my story inspires some Protestants who were on the fence about joining Catholicism like I was. Thanks be to God!

But after lurking here without an account for half a year since I myself leave protestantism and marrying an agnostic husband (almost atheists as he one day told me that God for him  was at the same level of table manners -subjective for a better explanation-). Since November i started praying the rosary with an app. Everynight. Before i tried to debate with him. To explain misunderstandings as I myself had answers in the process to. Inviting him to pray with me. To pray for me at least. So i stopped pushing and making the effort myself, alone.

Instead I asked Mary to intercede for him. To help him guide my husband to her Son. One night my mother in law wich is catholic and thinks i am still protestant send me a message thanking me to making his son a believer.

I disnt understood at first. She told me that at least he is in a church reading the bible. And i told her : I am praying every night the rosary so God can gave him the need to seek him.

It made her so happy. She told me my husband in a call early that morning tried to share a gospel message (weird because my husband does not read the bible never pays atrention to the sermon at the protestant church we used to go).

And that he used words such as ""is in God hands, I know (FIL) is with bad health and i cant stop the day hes gone but hope you both are in the right path before God"".


Some might say that he talked like that because he repect her mom beliefes. But the truth is that my husband used to mock her and brag about marrying a satanist in order to go away further from the faith. Sometimes i would sense my Husband anger of calling God father because for him a father was an actual figure to bond with not an abstract idea.


That same night he himself told me; lets pray. I still domt have enough faith. But I want to pray for you and to having childs.

RealThomasAquinas,0.0,894.0,"Hey guys. I‚Äôm a 19M planning to convert out of Protestantism to the RCC. I grew up in a rather conservative Baptist tradition and unfortunately my parents are very anti-Catholic. I haven‚Äôt told anyone but one of my sisters and one of my brothers (I have many siblings) and I don‚Äôt look forward to telling my parents (it‚Äôs probably gonna be a while before I do). I‚Äôve been studying Catholic theology for some time at first trying to refute it and then eventually just trying to understand it. Recently I have begun to find it very very hard to refute and I think the next big step is to convert. Unfortunately the situation with my parents isn‚Äôt going to be fun. They both have strong emotional disdain for Catholicism and doctrinal objections largely based on their false perceptions of what the Catholic Church teaches. All I can do is stress that this has been a purely intellectual journey for me but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna help anything. I could use prayer for that, honestly. Also, this is probably going to severely damage my social life and may ruin friendships, but it‚Äôs worth it to me if it means I get to be a part of the one, true, holy, apostolic, and Catholic Church. 

I am going to keep my plans to convert secret for the time being (I‚Äôll have to do RCIA but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need to be baptized since I have already been baptized with the Trinitarian formula) but I‚Äôm gonna convert as soon as I move out and then try to break it to my parents lightly.

QuackNagy,0.0,880.0,"My girlfriend has been attending mass, reading spiritual and theological books and asking big questions for months now. We started Catechism for RCIA in August. Although it has been a prominent part of our lives, it has had to stay under wraps until recently (her parents were raised Catholic, saw the ""truth"" and became protestants and are very anti-Catholic). Once her parents got the idea that she might be changing camps, they asked ""are you converting?"" To which she said ""yes"". Praise God!

They brought in their Bible study leader who is a learned, charismatic and kind man, who is anti-Catholic but fair. He asked me questions that required some unpopular answers, which was admittedly difficult, i.e. ""So you believe the Catholic Church is the one true Church, and all others are false?"" and then pressed on to the Pope, the political side of the church, the apparently confounding Marian doctrines and the embarrassing side of the history of individuals within the Church. I noticed that everything on the Protestant side that needed explanation boiled down to presuppositions and ""that's the wrong interpretation"". Aside from these, it was a lovely and polite evening.

People, know your faith! Be ready to defend it! If I were a less stubborn man, or had I met with these challenges earlier in life, I could have folded. 

But all in all, we defended ourselves well, and only left that exhausting chat with more zeal and desire to know the faith, Holy Scripture and the Church. I don't think her parents were expecting much of a decent rebuttal and, while they would probably see that they came out on top last night, they could see that we weren't interested in coming out on top, and that there was a certainty and obedience in their daughter that they had missed out on.

He asked me questions that required some unpopular answers, which was admittedly difficult, i.e. ""So you believe the Catholic Church is the one true Church, and all others are false?"" and then pressed on to the Pope, the political side of the church, the apparently confounding Marian doctrines and the embarrassing side of the history of individuals within the Church. I noticed that everything on the Protestant side that needed explanation boiled down to presuppositions and ""that's the wrong interpretation"". Aside from these, it was a lovely and polite evening.

People, know your faith! Be ready to defend it! If I were a less stubborn man, or had I met with these challenges earlier in life, I could have folded. 

But all in all, we defended ourselves well, and only left that exhausting chat with more zeal and desire to know the faith, Holy Scripture and the Church. I don't think her parents were expecting much of a decent rebuttal and, while they would probably see that they came out on top last night, they could see that we weren't interested in coming out on top, and that there was a certainty and obedience in their daughter that they had missed out on.

ThomasDowd_ca,0.0,875.0,"I've been noticing a trend in a lot of posts on this forum, when people ask questions (or offer answers) in moral issues. Someone will, for example, put forward a moral scenario, and then ask ""Is this a mortal sin"" or ""did I commit a mortal sin"". Or, someone might say ""that action is a mortal sin"" or (worse) ""you committed a mortal sin"".

As a pastor of souls, I think we need to be really careful about the use of the term ""mortal sin"". It is almost impossible to say if this or that sin was actually mortal because for a sin to be mortal there must be an objective component (called ""grave matter"") and a subjective component (a high degree of knowledge and consent). As you can imagine, measuring the subjective element is extraordinarily difficult, even for the person who committed the sin.

People often seem to use the term ""mortal sin"" to refer to grave matter only (for example, if someone asks ""Is abortion a mortal sin?"") The term is being used imprecisely. Abortion is grave matter, for sure, and therefore is part of the raw material for mortal sin, but one cannot call a category of action ""mortal sin"". The correct question is ""Is abortion grave matter for sin"" or ""Is abortion gravely sinful"", something along those lines.

It is generally much easier to see if the action involved grave matter, as that is the objective component and easier to measure. It is also possible (and even pastorally wise) to warn people who are committing sins involving grave matter that their souls are in peril, and to invite them to repent. But to go so far as to say ""that particular sin was mortal"" is going too far, especially given the limits of the medium we have here. I don't think we want to trigger people in their scrupulosity, or (worse) possibly lead them to despair.

I write this because I've noticed a real desire for moral goodness (and moral guidance) in this forum, and it impresses me. However, it is hard for me, as a pastor of souls, to answer an imprecise question. I also don't have the time, personally, to police the giving of imprecise answers. So I offer this observation to the community so that we can better support one another.",0,"We need to be careful using the term ""mortal sin""",875.0,0.96,"We need to be careful using the term ""mortal sin"" I've been noticing a trend in a lot of posts on this forum, when people ask questions (or offer answers) in moral issues.

ComfortableYogurts,0.0,771.0,"My wife and I decided two years ago that we wanted to start having children. Around that time, we also decided to join the Catholic Church. After a year of no success, we were devastated. All of our siblings and friends were having children around us and it was almost impossible to be happy for them because we were just reminded of our own pain. 

We decided my wife should see a fertility counselor, which went on for another year. The doctor said it was totally unexplained. Again, no success and the sadness became unbearable. Things would get better halfway through each month, and then we‚Äôd get the news that she wasn‚Äôt pregnant, and we‚Äôd break down again. Some of our friends were so kind, others were rather callous and didn‚Äôt understand the pain of the situation. We prayed to God every night, and also prayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Gerard, and Blessed Margaret, but one night we didn‚Äôt pray and we never picked up the habit again. 

Both of us became very jaded. I became emotionally vacant after watching my wife whimper on the couch nightly for a week at a time. She started to doubt God‚Äôs existence, or at the very least his interest in interacting us. Only those who have dealt with this or are close to someone who has dealt with this understand how horrible this experience can be and why those suffering it react the way they do. Research has found that women in particular can suffer PTSD due to infertility. 

The holiday season was coming up and we were (rather unsuccessfully) preparing to deal with seeing our nieces, nephews, and children of friends. Again, we were never unhappy that those around us had children, but they did remind us of what we couldn‚Äôt have. The Monday before Thanksgiving, I was getting ready for work. I was in a very sour mood because the the previous night my wife said she felt her cramps coming on and we both wept for a long time. She walked into the room crying that morning, which somewhat triggered me. I turned around and she was holding a positive pregnancy test. I couldn‚Äôt believe it.

She‚Äôs been to the doctor since. She‚Äôs 10 weeks along now and our baby has a very, very strong heartbeat. Part of me still can‚Äôt believe it, another part of me feels some shame because I wrote God off for the last 10 months yet he still blessed us. Another part of me is overjoyed, but I‚Äôm too scared to totally feel it because I wonder if this is too good to be true and something bad will happen. Either way, I wanted to share my story with you guys and give glory to God despite our lack of faith throughout this ordeal.

Edit: I want to add that there‚Äôs a lot of healing and reconciliation I need to do with God.

AloneBowl,0.0,744.0,"Hello r/Catholicism, some of you may remember me from 2 years ago although I'm sure most of you don't. I used this throwaway exclusively for expressing my deep marital troubles and asking for prayer support from the faithful members of this sub. The entire story is way too long to post, but feel free to look at my post history to get a glimpse into that time two years ago.

I'm back to give you all an update because I think you deserve it. Everyone on this sub was so kind to me and offered me so much love and prayer during my ""dark night of the soul"". I'm going to apologize in advance because I'm sure this is going to be long; a lot has transpired since my last post. I'll do my best to summarize though.

For a while things got worse, and worse and living with my spouse was becoming unbearable. I loved him so much and he just kept pulling further and further away from me. One day I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't keep fighting against it. I felt so lost and hopeless and like God had abandoned me in my deepest need. I was clinging to the Blessed Virgin. On this particular day I prayed ""Mother, I can't keep doing this. I don't want to give up on my marriage but I also don't want to keep fighting for something that God hasn't meant for me. I need to know what I'm supposed to do. If I'm meant to keep praying and hoping to save my family I will, but if I'm meant to accept that this is God's will and start praying to get through all of this I will do that to. Please, send me a sign, but Mother, it has to be clear. It has to smack me in the face because if it's anything less I'll convince myself I imagined it."" Afterwards I prayed the rosary and left it in her hands. Later that day I started to get myself ready for mass and as I bent to get my hair curler from below the sink something flew out of the cabinet and literally hit me in the face. When I went to see what had just attacked me I saw that it was an engagement photo of my husband and I (I have no explanation for how or why that photo was in there). ""Okay, Mom. I read you loud and clear"" I promised Our Lady that because she gave me this sign I would pray for our marriage up until the moment when I received an annulment.

I had a clear hope to cling to and I took absolutely everything to the Blessed Mother and asked for her to intercede for me; reminding her of the Wedding Feast at Cana and that perhaps the only reason I would receive a miracle was because she asked it of Our Lord. However, things didn't look up. My husband moved out of our house later that month and I was in utter despair and desperation as we continued to move through the divorce process. I kept my promise to pray for my marriage but it didn't seem to be helping.

As sad and alone as I was soon separation became my ""new normal"". We co-parented well and got along okay but there was still so much pain. I was still so in love with him and we were still each others best friend. I tried seeing someone else but it made my hurt worse. I kept praying for our marriage but in October of 2019 we signed the final divorce papers and I began the process of annulment. I often wondered how I had gotten it so wrong. How on earth had I misinterpreted that sign? Feeling much less optimistic I continued to pray for our marriage because I promised Our Lady I would.

Jumping ahead to December of 2019 my (now ex) husband came to me crying that he missed me, he missed our family, he had made so many mistakes, etc. I was hopeful but cautious. I immediately made my priest aware of the situation and sought his council and advice. He was so helpful to me and understanding of my situation (he himself coming from divorced parents). Eventually I halted the annulment process for the time being.

We went through a lot of turmoil trying to reconcile and heal and trust each other. It was hard and somedays seemed absolutely impossible. Then the quarantine happened and we agreed that it would be best for my husband to come be quarantined at my house so that he could still see our daughter. I thought this time would make or break us. We went through so much external stress during that time (as was the rest of the world, I know). Lots of ups and downs, but one night we laid it all out on the table. Everything we'd done in the separation that we had been avoiding talking about, all our feelings, hopes, and needs and from that point everything completely shifted.

From that night onward our relationship became totally different. We were our old selves but better. Our communication is 1000x's better, we both sought treatment for mental health and physical health issues, we became more accepting and mature. We are now 6 months from that point and things have never been better. We just recently told our family members that we have reconciled and everyone on both sides is over joyed!

I just wanted to publicly thank Jesus for his tender Mercy to our family, Our Lady whom I give full credit to in getting us here and helping me maintain my hope, sanity, and faith in a time where I had every reason to lose all three, to the communion of saints whom I called on for so much help, and to everyone (especially this community) who offered prayers for us. Miracles do happen!

May anyone who is in pain or despair right now surrender themselves to the love of Jesus and Mary.

He was so incredibly passionate in the way he spoke, his homily, preparing the Eucharist, his faith was absolutely incredible. At the time I thought it was almost humorous compared to the Priests I am used to but I realised he is literally on fire for Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit.

Then came communion and I‚Äôll never forget this moment. I watched him give communion with complete reverence and so meaningfully. Then it was my turn and he said ‚ÄúThe body of Christ‚Äù loudly, I said Amen and as he was giving me the host he whispered ‚ÄúJesus loves you‚Äù, the second part caught me so off guard and I was filled with emotion.

My (Catholic) mother gave me up for adoption when she was 20. I'm so grateful that she gave me the chance to exist here on Earth. Because of her heart-wrenching choice, I'm here, I'm married, we have three beautiful children so far. Just think of the many generations that will exist one day as a result of that one choice that my mom made. 

It hurts my heart when people justify abortion by saying that they could never allow their child to go through the difficulties of being adopted. It hurts my heart when people who are suffering from infertility have ""Why don't you just adopt"" listed as one of the top ten things we aren't allowed to say to them. The mere suggestion of adopting a child who needs a home is offensive to them, but making human lives in a lab, selecting them for sex and/or perceived defects, sticking them in a freezer or destroying them is fine. I was once a defenseless embryo. We all were! It really gets me down sometimes when I think about it.

So.... who else is here because their mother made the choice to give birth to you under difficult circumstances? Who else had an imperfect life as an adopted or foster kid, but knows their value is infinite to our loving God?

It is supposed that the killing actually took place in the basilique.

This act disgust me and I feel hopeless...

Edit: there are now 3 victims and some injured

Victims were two women one aged 30 years old, an other aged 70 years old and a man, a sacristan, aged 45 years old.

This took place in the basilique.

I am crying but I am going to church later today to pray.

sethn61,0.0,681.0,"Okay so, I used to be in the LGBT community, identified as bisexual for quite some time, and I suffered debilitating gender dysphoria for a while and attempted a gender transition at 19. My late teenage life was defined by all this.

Long story short I abandoned that life to persue Christianity because I cared more about the truth no matter the personal cost and because I had good friends who had the nerve to ask me what I was living for and slowly opened the door to Christ, and I eventually discovered the Catholic Church had the fullness of him. As of writing this I am now Baptized, Confirmed and Communed.

That life change happened about 20 months ago, I recently had a conversation with my close friend and she believes that this whole thing is a crutch. That all of my devotion is just a coping mechanism.

""You changed your entire view points so quick and who you were when you became religious. 
It's like, you were scared to not have something there for you. 
You've made your religion your personality and it's so strange, 
You went upside down when you chose your religion and it just wasn't a you thing to do"". 

For further context, I approached the faith with extreme reservation, and for a while I didn't want it to be true, it was only after seeing all the arguments, being treated with unconditional love from Christians who really believed that I opened my heart to God, and that took longer than 6 months.

I mentioned that I abandoned any LGBT label because I believe they are demeaning and reductive and her response was 'You stopped identifying with who you are  when you delve into religion'. I was taken aback but she completely believes this.

She is convinced that, if only I opened myself up to positive sexual exploration, and spent my 20's hooking up, trying drugs, having little moral standards other than 'I'm young so this is the time to experiment', that I will be happier.

I fully intend to travel, go to parties, and self explore for the next decade onwards, but I'm not going to neglect God to do that.

I think half of the trouble is just that the faith is confusing to outsiders and I end up being the ambassador because nobody cares to research.

She also made the strange argument that when I have children I should be able to have had the experience with that life so I can warn my kids properly about it and that point almost gave me a nose bleed.

""I just wish, you gave yourself more, instead of trans to religious in like a year :/""

I understand that I'm going to take years to stabilize as a Christian and as a person, but I'm starting to get really concerned my lifelong friends could become a hurdle for me. 

Not sure what to do :/

Astrolys,0.0,662.0,"Today, at the invitation from a fellow french classmate, I attended a normal Mass just for the purpose of attending it.

I've been living in Poland for a few months now as part of my Erasmus year and a fellow classmate I met during online courses proposed me to see a Mass held in French in Krak√≥w.

&amp;#x200B;

I had not attended a normal mass in a long time (except religious ceremonies like a few marriages, funerals and see the first communion of a family member). Actually, I hadn't attended any Mass since shortly after my confirmation, about 7 years ago I think ? I had quickly lost faith in the existence of (a) God and started believing in Atheism. But in the past couple of years, I went through a dark period of my life, I was depressed and I started putting in question my faith in Atheism\*. I went through some kind of spiritualist ideas and stuff, and slowly started seeing something that now feel obvious, something that always felt true even when I denied it, something that I always came back to in some ways: My faith in God and Jesus Christ.

It's been a few months, perhaps more than a year since I stopped lying to myself on this matter and the morals I embraced with my renewed faith helped me go through this depressed part of me, but also thanks to new friends I made.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I felt uneasy going to church. I had forgotten pretty much everything on How2Jesus, except the absolute fundamentals (Hail Mary and Our Father, basic things, etc). I even forgot most the Bible and stuff. I bought myself a New Testament quite recently (but I forgot it back home in France.....) and I'm still quite lost.

I also felt uneasy with the Church itself as a whole. I have strong political convictions that are (or seem) more than often in contradiction with the Church's political stances. I'm simply going to say I'm quite strongly left leaning (in the European sense of leftist ofc) in hope of not setting the comment section ablaze. Even though my beliefs contradict the Church's, I do not feel like they're wrong or contradict my faith. I would be what my classmate call a ""Red Christian"".

&amp;#x200B;

And despite all that, my classmate, even though I barely knew her invited me and helped me all along the ceremony. And that felt very good, and very right. Something that seems inherently nice and happy. I was quite lost but still, saying those few phrases in public, this prayers in this sacred house of God, and those songs... really, all of that put my soul at ease somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to ask you now, how can I improve my practice of my faith ? I would need any help you may kindly give me.

&amp;#x200B;

Peace on you all.

&amp;#x200B;

NB: \* I said ""faith in Atheism"" because I strongly agree that there is no proof of the existence of God, nor there is proof of is non-existence.

moodybiatch,0.0,659.0,"I was born and raised in Italy, where Catholicism is still going quite strong compared to others countries and many parents still send their kids to religious education groups, called ""catechesi"". After many years and some personal spiritual changes, I now consider myself an atheist, but still retain most, if not all the values that I have been taught in my religious education, so I wanted to share this with you.

Most of my fellow atheists give me dirty looks when I say I'm proud I've walked this path, assuming that I've been indoctrinated with homophobic or racist values, some think it was a political thing and my parents must vote for a right wing party because they are Christians, some even call them out for child abuse saying that they took my religious freedom away from me. I guess many people see that type of education as if it had some sort of army training level of discipline, without really knowing what's behind it.

""Catechesi"" was not army training or indoctrination, it was a safe place for kids to go to after school, one hour per week, to learn about moral values together with other kids, play, have fun, and be guided in our christian path by two lovely ladies that I would put among the sweetest people I've met in my life. They never told us that homosexuality is a sin, they never told us that Muslims are bad. Instead they taught us to love each other and every human being as we love ourselves, to be forgiving and caring, to help those in need and not be greedy. All values that every kid should be taught in my opinion, but many parents and teachers will not directly address. 

We had summer camps and Saturday afternoon activities to get the kids to play together, we rented the football field of the neighborhood and I remember some Muslim kids were always there and were very much welcome to play with us, and in the evening they often joined us for dinner and even the priest himself wouldn't flinch if they didn't pray with us before eating.

When we were old enough we even had an ""emotional education group"" where we got taught how to deal with the hormonal changes we were going through (early teens), how to have healthy relationships and how to respect and value our (and other people's) bodies. No one told us ""if you have sex before marriage you're gonna go to hell"", they instead taught us not to rush into relationships, and that our sexuality was something that should have been dear to us and was not worth wasting on someone we were not ready to do it with. And something that I EXTREMELY appreciate now as an adult, was that they not only told us to respect ourselves, but to respect others as well. We talked about consent, and about not taking advantage of people, and I believe that was a huge thing back in the days, since we always assume kids will grow up knowing what's right and what's wrong, but we hardly ever explicitly tell them. 

So this is my personal experience with Catholic education, and I can't say anything but positive things about it. I hope everyone can have such a good experience, and I wish something like this could be put un every child's path, either in a religious or non religious manner. And hopefully this is going to lift a bit of that stereotype that is very popular among atheists today, that Christians are all racist bigots stuck in their ways and that Christian values are all based on hate and strict interpretation of the Bible.

Edit: I really appreciate the support I have received from this community, and how understanding everyone is being even though we might not share the same beliefs. Since some of you are trying to talk about my beliefs, either to try and talk me into considering becoming a Christian again or simply because they might be interested in this type of discussion, I kindly ask to not do it on this post.

Pax_et_Bonum,0.0,644.0,"We are establishing this megathread for all discussion of the revelations of the Holy Father's most recent comments on Same-Sex Civil Unions. The story of the comments can be found [here.](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-calls-for-civil-union-law-for-same-sex-couples-in-shift-from-vatican-stance-12462) All other comments and posts should be directed here.

To briefly summarize: 

&gt;In a documentary that premiered Wednesday in Rome, Pope Francis called for the passage of civil union laws for same-sex couples, departing from the position of the Vatican‚Äôs doctrinal office and the pope‚Äôs predecessors on the issue.

&gt;The remarks came amid a portion of the documentary that reflected on pastoral care for those who identify as LGBT. 

&gt;‚ÄúHomosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They‚Äôre children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it,‚Äù Pope Francis said in the film, of his approach to pastoral care.

&gt;After those remarks, and in comments likely to spark controversy among Catholics, Pope Francis weighed in directly on the issue of civil unions for same-sex couples.

&gt;‚ÄúWhat we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered,‚Äù the pope said. ‚ÄúI stood up for that.‚Äù

&gt;The remarks come in ‚ÄúFrancesco,‚Äù a documentary on the life and ministry of Pope Francis which premiered Oct. 21 as part of the Rome Film Festival, and is set to make its North American premiere on Sunday.

This movie hasn't made it's way to North America, so we don't know the context of these comments, or how they might have been edited (either deceptively or not). It may be best to wait until this movie is shown to make a judgement, or to see the response of the Holy See on this matter.

We remind everyone that *all our rules still apply for all commenters*. The previous thread on this matter quickly became overrun with brigaders and commenters from outside the subreddit. We ask that all comments remain charitable, and all rule-violating comments and posts be reported to the moderators.

Niki_Anne_Goldeye,0.0,641.0,"I just wanted to share with someone. When we first started dating I was really nervous, I had been determined to find a normal Roman Catholic to date. My exes either turned out to be against Catholicism or one was Latin Catholic but was a cafeteria Catholic and tried to pick and choose what he would follow. Still when I meet someone who was evangelical, something told me to pursue it.

We were very clear from the start that I was staying Catholic and our kids would be Catholic. We met with a deacon who is married to a non-Catholic shortly after we got engaged. He gave us the advice for fianc√© to take RCIA but it wasn‚Äôt the right time to sign up.

Well after trying a few times to attend mass and service at his church on the same Sunday as well as taking all the Catholic marriage prep classes, he decided to take RCIA.

Due to covid his class meets biweekly instead of weekly and they have videos to watch on the off weeks. We decided it would be better if he had a sponsor that could guide him in raising kids Catholic and answer deeper theological questions. I was raised Catholic by a single mother who is no longer practicing so I didn‚Äôt feel like I was the best guide for him.  I‚Äôve also had concussions since being confirmed and the information is somewhere in my brain but doesn‚Äôt come out very well (I can only remember prayers I have memorized half the time with the written text in front of me) so he needed someone he can talk to on a deep level.

Every time he comes to see me from class he is excited about what he learned and was thrilled when he got his own Rosary so he didn‚Äôt have to borrow one of mine when we pray. He told me last week that they asked in class who was highly considering becoming Catholic and he was one of the people who raised his hand.

His 2 biggest questions have been addressed to some extent in his RCIA classes. 

He won‚Äôt be Catholic by our December wedding but things look hopeful that he will be before we have our first child and I‚Äôm just so excited.

I need to get better about being a practicing Catholic but I‚Äôm so excited my love will most likely be joining in being Catholic.

j4242,0.0,625.0,"This post is long-winded and sort of a mess organizationally, so I apologize in advance. I just felt that I needed to put this out there. 

My story is kind of a long one so to spare you the verbosity **the tl;dr is this: I was raised as an evangelical (protestant) Christian and was fairly religious but always had a peculiar attraction to Catholicism, I became an atheist in my early 20s, and now, at 24, I have a deep desire to have a relationship with Jesus Christ, and feel the Catholic Church is the one he founded. All the same, I still have episodes of doubt and fear that undermine the strength of my faith.**

I‚Äôm a 24yo man, recently graduated college and I‚Äôm having what you might as well call a quarter-life crisis. For most of my life, I‚Äôve dealt with depression, which, in the past year, has really exceeded a manageable level. At the risk of sounding histrionic or making this post sound attention-hungry, I struggle with loneliness, isolation (as many are right now during the pandemic) and this past summer, I attempted suicide. 

I‚Äôve been desperate to derive some kind of meaningful vocation out of this life. In the advent of my post-college years, I‚Äôve struggled to find a job, and work a job that I hate. I don‚Äôt have any social life whatsoever. 

While both my parents were raised and christened in the Catholic Church, they raised my sister and I in a series of evangelical churches we drifted through throughout my childhood‚Äîteenage years. I had a very strong Christian upbringing, and was well-versed in the Bible at a young age (I don‚Äôt say that to come across as self-aggrandizing or arrogant, just to provide context). 

The church we went to throughout my time in high school coincided with the happiest times of my life: while I always legitimately believed in the supernatural reality of God, Christ, the Trinity, and eternal life, my spiritual life *really* bloomed during this period. I became very close with the people at my church, and got very involved in my youth group, worship team, and volunteered in various capacities. 

Most significantly, however,  my faith became the strongest at this time. I prayed and worshipped God in the most earnest and disciplined capacity I could, not just in Church but all the time. I read the Bible. I prayed ‚Äúwithout ceasing,‚Äù as 1 Thessalonians commands, and often felt as though the Holy Spirit spoke to me.

Long story short, after high school, my family left our church while i was away at college, without telling me, and that hurt a lot. Eventually, we stopped going to church altogether, and now are really not religious at all. Eventually, through college, while I didn‚Äôt lead a dramatically sinful life, my belief in God eroded and eventually disappeared. I was an atheist. I had no desire for chruch, or any spiritual dimension to life whatsoever, for that matter. 

Fast forward to a few weeks before this past Christmas. For some reason, I‚Äôd been starting to read/watch a lot of videos about the RC church. This was something I did a lot throughout my life; despite being Protestant, I had a very specific, persistent, curiosity regarding Catholicism. Years ago, I‚Äôd go through phases where I‚Äôd watch documentaries, read articles, etc., about the Church. I was really interested in Rennaissance art as a middle schooler, and devoured books on Rome, Michelangelo, Raphael, Julius Ii, the Medicis, etc. Every time, I got a special...i don‚Äôt know...feeling looking at those gorgeous paintings, churches and sculptures. 

One day, maybe a week before Christmas, while really struggling with loneliness (though I still live with my parents) I happened to look at our nativity we set up in our house every year. I looked at the Christ child‚Äôs face (I‚Äôm kind of getting choked up now as I‚Äôm typing this lol) and felt, extremely clearly, that I missed Him and His presence in Christmas. 

My researching then intensified. I broke out a copy of C.S. Lewis‚Äô *Mere Christianity.* I started watching tons of Catholic contect on YouTube (Ascension Presents, Breaking the Habit, etc.) and listening to Gregorian chants and watching Masses, both Novus Ordo and Latin Masses. Through all this, I‚Äôd get an immense amount of comfort and peace immersing myself in Catholic literature and content. 

And now here I am. I think I want to be Catholic. I pray every day now. Prayer helps me abstain from indulging in a lot of sinful behavior, it gives me peace. I‚Äôve stopped drinking heavily. My depression has markedly improved, although I still have bad days. Even though I can‚Äôt recieve the Eucharist (yet) I ask God to help me discipline myself every day, amd I ask the Virgin Mary to pray for me. 

There are still some problems though. **First,** I still have doubts. I have episodes where I question the validity of God‚Äôs existence. Despite this‚Äîand I cannot overstate this‚ÄîI WANT Christ and the Father to be real. I WANT all of this to be true. I now have so much respect for the Church, amd how it has postively impacted the world. It‚Äôs so beautiful. I WANT to recieve Him and have an intimate relationship with my Lord and Father in Heaven, yet I feel guilty when my faith falters. 

**Second,** I feel very uncomfortable talking to my family about this. I don‚Äôt know what kind of a reaction they‚Äôll have. In partculalr, I‚Äôm afraid my mom, who was always the most devout, will see my rejection of our Protestantism as her failing and/or a repudiation of her on my behalf. 

Should I talk to a priest? What should I do next? Does God accept my prayers even though I haven‚Äôt fully converted yet?

michael_schwartz,0.0,617.0,"Hi. I want to share a little recent experience. It sounds incredible, and I would be the first one to be skeptic about it if I read it online. But I'm so surprised that I want to tell the world.

I'm a young lawyer and I had a trial assigned for this morning. The trial would be about an eviction, and I foresaw I could do very little to help my soon-to be evicted client. I knew I would be in a difficult and uncomfortable situation before a rude judge, in which I would probably have almost nothing to say. 

Knowing all of this, yesterday, when going to bed I had an idea: There must be some lawyers in purgatory that can give me a couple of ideas and help me be calm during the trial, right? I could ask them for help. They say souls in purgatory help us. So I took my rosary in my hand, shook it and half-seriously half-jokingly jokingly said. ""Hey, souls in purgatory. I have to face this situation. If there's someone (specially some lawyer) who wants to help me, look at what I have here!"". Then, I half-laughed and fell asleep.

But what a surprise awaited me. I was awoken in the middle of the night by a very persistent noise: some knocking followed by a squeak, in a very regular rhythm, until I got completely awake. It stopped there. It had come from the flat immediately above mine. And then I remembered there's no neighbour living there. It's empty. Completely empty. I was (and still am) absolutely convinced that the knocking was an ""acknowledgment of receipt"".

I had no fear at all. I was even happy. I didn't expect that at all. Since I was completely awake in the middle of the night, I decided to pray a little bit. Just 5 minutes. And I felt a clear spiritual consolation. I went to bed again and fell asleep again.

So today I had my trial. I had a couple of new ideas before it started, and I clearly knew what I had to say. I spoke calmly, and everything went fast, clean and nice. Even another lawyer congratulated me.

And now, I'm spending my day fulfilling my part of the deal: praying the rosary for that soul who helped me.",0,Purgatory must be true... (woah!),617.0,0.97,"Purgatory must be true... (woah!) Hi. I want to share a little recent experience. It sounds incredible, and I would be the first one to be skeptic about it if I read it online. But I'm so surprised that I want to tell the world.

I'm a young lawyer and I had a trial assigned for this morning. The trial would be about an eviction, and I foresaw I could do very little to help my soon-to be evicted client. I knew I would be in a difficult and uncomfortable situation before a rude judge, in which I would probably have almost nothing to say. 

Knowing all of this, yesterday, when going to bed I had an idea: There must be some lawyers in purgatory that can give me a couple of ideas and help me be calm during the trial, right? I could ask them for help. They say souls in purgatory help us. So I took my rosary in my hand, shook it and half-seriously half-jokingly jokingly said. ""Hey, souls in purgatory. I have to face this situation. If there's someone (specially some lawyer) who wants to help me, look at what I have here!"". Then, I half-laughed and fell asleep.

But what a surprise awaited me. I was awoken in the middle of the night by a very persistent noise: some knocking followed by a squeak, in a very regular rhythm, until I got completely awake. It stopped there. It had come from the flat immediately above mine. And then I remembered there's no neighbour living there. It's empty. Completely empty. I was (and still am) absolutely convinced that the knocking was an ""acknowledgment of receipt"".

I had no fear at all. I was even happy. I didn't expect that at all. Since I was completely awake in the middle of the night, I decided to pray a little bit. Just 5 minutes. And I felt a clear spiritual consolation. I went to bed again and fell asleep again.

So today I had my trial. I had a couple of new ideas before it started, and I clearly knew what I had to say. I spoke calmly, and everything went fast, clean and nice. Even another lawyer congratulated me.

AllanTheCowboy,0.0,577.0,"After reading another post, I wanted to share this story.

I made my first confession at 9, my second confession at 10, and my third confession at 34.  Basically I grew up in the 80's and 90's and learned confession wasn't a big deal, and it didn't matter much whether you went.

So I fell into a lot of horrible, horrible sins.  There are some you can read about in my post history.  There are others you cannot.  For about the last 15 years of those 24, on and off I knew I needed to go to Confession; that was what my conscience and my soul needed.  But I was afraid.  I was afraid of what the priest would say and how he would react.  I was afraid of the penance.  I was afraid to say the things out loud.  I was afraid that the Seal wasn't all it was supposed to be.  My only experience had been with face to face confession and I didn't realize screens were still an option.  I was afraid the priest wouldn't absolve me because some of the things I did were just so horrible.

So, a lot of things happened when I was 33-34 and I was finally driven back to the confessional to reconcile myself with God.  It took months to get up the nerve.  I went somewhere other than my parish so I wouldn't be recognized.  I made a list.  It was full of things I did ""countless times"".  Some typical.  Some horrendous.  Some I didn't think of until subsequent Confessions.  So I went in with this list.  I was prepared for judgement, lectures, admonitions, heavy penances, and horrified reactions.  And I knew priests heard everything.  I've got to tell you, I was a great sinner.  I mean GREAT.  Like, great at it.  I was proficient at horrendous sins, and had even felt great accomplishment in how good I was at some of them.  So even though I knew that a priest had heard everything, I still wondered if he would have heard some of mine.

So in I go with my list.  This priest clearly had a playbook for guys like me, looking back.

""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been 25 years since my last confession.""  I waited.  I waited for some kind of reaction to how horrible of a Catholic I had been for 25 years.  I got a barely verbal acknowledgement with an ""okay, let's get on with it then"" tone.

He seemed almost impatient as I listed each sin.  He kept giving me an ""mhm"" with this ""okay next sin, hurry it along"" implication.  It felt kind of weird and dismissive at first because part of me wanted to be chastised and berated and condemned.  But he just kept pushing me from one to the next.  This didn't give me time to fall apart or lose my nerve.  In the moment I kind of thought it was ""that sounds like paper... I better push this guy so the other people in line get their turn.""  And maybe there was some of that, but I look back now and I realize he was letting me know ""no problem; we can deal with that.  That one too.  That one too.  That one, too, no problem.  Yep I can absolve that - and I'm going to.  What else?  I can handle whatever you've got there.""  Then when I was done, he was great.  I had started to be worried that it was going to be a quick, ""ok you're absolved, next penitent please.""  But when I finished my list, his main message was ""you came here.  You confessed it.  You aren't here on this day by accident after 25 years.  God brought you here.  God's with you. God will give you the strength.  You keep trying and He will be there.""  And my penance was an Our Father and five Hail Mary's or something along those lines.

That priest gave me exactly what I needed that day.  God sent me to the right priest on the right day for what I needed to be able to come back properly to Him.  None of the things I was afraid of happened.  That confessor made it easy.  The hard part is entering the Confessional, and beginning.

I know how scary it is.  I was terrified.  It took me years to decide to go, and then months after that to actually go.  And that whole time I had nothing to be afraid of.  Nothing at all.  It's the best thing I ever did.

If you're scared, you don't need to be.  If you're ashamed, you don't need to be.  If you're paralyzed, ask Jesus to free you from that paralysis.  You are not beyond redemption.  If I wasn't, believe me that you're not.  You will look back on the day of that confession as the day your life changed forever.  The day your healing began.  The day you started to understand God's love.

And it'll only take about 10 or 15 minutes.  Your whole life can turn around in a quarter of an hour.  You can do this.  God is calling you.  God wants to forgive you.  You just need to go in that little room of healing, and ask him.

You can do this!  Step up.  The Holy Spirit is in you.  Let Him lead.  You can do it!",0,"For anyone Worried about going to Confession, Here is the Story of my Third Confession, 24 years after my Second",577.0,0.98,"For anyone Worried about going to Confession, Here is the Story of my Third Confession, 24 years after my Second After reading another post, I wanted to share this story.

**PHILOSOPHERS ON ABORTION AND INFANTICIDE -** ***Frank Bouchier-Haye***

[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol2/bh.html](http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol2/bh.html)

With it, I have several major views on abortion that I am not afraid to share with others when the topic seriously comes up (and it seriously has, myself living in a very liberal city). I want to share a few of the points that come up often, both to hear what others think, but also so we can be legitimate consumers of the truth as political pundits ascend the podiums and spew lie after lie.

**Premise**: It's a woman's body, so it's a woman's choice \[to be pregnant, or not\].

**Answer**: This is a lie. It's not a woman's body, it's the woman's body and the baby's body.

**Premise**: It's okay to abort babies that are not viable outside the womb.

**Answer:** All babies are not viable outside the womb. Or viability is never guaranteed.

**Premise:** Abortions should be permitted for cases of rape and incest

**Answer**: Killing the baby will not undo the crime. It compounds the psychological stress of the act by adding a death to the damage done: the baby is not the rapist. Additionally, children born of rape or incest are not so different from us as we believe, nor do they want to be perceived/perceive themselves as less valuable to our society. One can even go so far to say that there are loving adoptive parents who would happily take such a baby in their home, and give it a future that few could dream of providing their children.

**Premise**: Overpopulation is an environmental issue.

**Answer:** Overpopulation is not an environmental issue, our unsustainable lifestyle is the environmental issue. An American has the same carbon footprint as over 200 people living in rural Africa or India, and these are people who are cooking with charcoal.

**Premise:** Abortions should be permitted if they will spare the mother's life.

**Answer**: There is no agreement among the medical community whether such cases even exist, evidence suggests that there are effective treatments for most situations (treating gestational diabetes and hypertension,up to and including early induction where both the baby and the mother's life can be saved.

**Premise**: Abortions should be permitted if a baby has a life threatening or debilitating/painful condition.

**Answer**: In utero diagnostics can be wrong, very wrong. What if you abort a baby based on a false positive? Supposing the baby were delivered and the condition was found to exist, would it not make sense to foster that child to the best of your ability up to a point of conscientious independent after which they can say whether they wish to live or die, in spite of their disability? For those disabled people, what do you think they largely wish regarding their life?: to live.

**Premise:** Reproductive rights provide economic opportunity to women

**Answer:** in parts:

1. Babies are not exchangeable. The babies that one kills early in one's life are not ""replaced"" when the family chooses to bear (and deliver) children later. 
2. Education and employment opportunities for women are not where they need to be in this country. If for a woman to achieve her best requires that she not have kids, then our society is flawed; we need to support mothers in tangible ways: we need paid parental leave as a federal mandate, we need to provide healthcare for pregnant mothers and early children
3. Low reproductive rate is a looming economic and public health disaster. The solution to this isn't simply telling women to have more babies, but asking what we ought to be doing to support families.

It was a long, strange journey and I'm so happy to start on the next phase of the path. (tl;dr - atheist for first 30 years of life, had some weird experiences, and here I am after 35 years.)

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 the church has to limit attendance (and rightly so), but I managed to get a seat at the daily mass tomorrow. I plan on going to confession before the mass. This will be my first confession and reception of the Eucharist that isn't part of a ritual or ceremony. It's all very exciting.

I don't know anyone who really cares about stuff like this, so I am sharing it with a bunch of strangers on the internet.

Bonus: bad photo of me going to receive my first communion. I nearly collapsed afterward. (Not because of the heat, but it was also hot.)

modernwhale465,0.0,559.0,"So first just a little bit of background, I‚Äôm an enrolled citizen of a federally recognized tribe, while many people claim to have Native American ancestry they have no connection to the Native American community, their ancestry, culture, or language. So before somebody claims I‚Äôm just some white person whose grandma claimed had some distant relative who was maybe full-blood Cherokee, I can assure you this is not the case. I moved back to my tribal land to serve my community and engage my tribe consistently. I study my people‚Äôs language ·è£·é≥Y and want my children to speak it as well. 

Now that it‚Äôs out of the way let me just say that first and foremost I am Catholic, and being Native and Catholic are not mutually exclusive. Many people like BLM and other groups are calling out for the injustice done to Native Americans by early Catholics and it makes my blood boil. They care so much about tearing down statues of St. Louis and other saints for no other reason than blind rage, and I see some Catholics act passively as if it doesn‚Äôt matter. Everyone who wants to tear down a statue of a Saint is undoubtably wrong and misguided. I know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir but I think the point I want to make is that they do not actually care about Native Americans at all. NA‚Äôs have the highest teen pregnancy rate among American ethnic groups, poverty and alcoholism are rampant on reservations, and not to mention the countless missing and murdered indigenous women right here in America. If they actually cared why aren‚Äôt they helping with any of those issues that actually effect the lives of Native Americans? Why not help the Covid epidemic on the Navajo Reservation? 

The question may come up about all the historical trauma that NA‚Äôs went through by Roman Catholic clergy and missionaries and I agree it was evil but that does not negate that massive NA population within the Catholic Church here in America. Here are some facts for those who want numbers: 


http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/cultural-diversity/upload/Two-Rivers-On-Catholic-Native-American-Culture-and-Diversity.pdf

There are many devout Roman Catholics within the Native community, we even have Saint Tekekwitha! I wish the Bishops here in America would turn their eyes to suffering of indigenous brothers and sisters who so desperately need it. I wish Bishop Barron had said ‚Äúwe will help the people Pine Ridge SD‚Äù instead of ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù. So many people now think Native Americans only existed between Columbus to cowboys, not realizing the Canadian government was abducting First Nation children and trying to civilize them up until 1997! So for anyone who defends these protestors thinking they are helping Natives, you are not, in fact you are hurting 20% of NA‚Äôs by attacking their faith. 

I don‚Äôt speak for all natives and I‚Äôm sure there are many who would disagree with me, but as a NA Catholic I cannot let these people speak for me. BLM is protesting for civil rights, the indigenous people of this country want political rights, our treaties to be recognized, and our people to be given to them what they deserve, so you yelling at a faithful Catholic priest for defending a statue of St. Louis isn‚Äôt helping, it‚Äôs reducing NA problems down to a civil level which it isn‚Äôt. 

For my Catholics I just want to say there is no reason to apologize or white wash history, obviously recognize the historical trauma sure but don‚Äôt feel bad for the sins of others. 

I‚Äôll wrap up with an interesting fact, Father John Shoenmakers, a Jesuit priest brought Catholicism to the Osage People and impacted them so much that the Osage word for priest is ‚ÄúSho-Mink-Ah‚Äù and they still have a thriving RC church on the Osage Reservation today!

FinnBalur1,0.0,527.0,"My parents wanted to send me to a Catholic school because they thought public schools will not teach me religious values. I attended it for four years, went to mass and had religion class. 

Going in, I knew nothing about Catholics. I learned so much valuable knowledge and information at Catholic school that I literally feel like there's a Catholic inside of me now (I consider them a 2nd family, of sort). Some religion teachers clearly did not care much about what they taught, but one in particular was so memorable, I will never forget all that he taught me and all our class discussions. He really opened my mind, taught me so much about Catholicism but I even started learning more about my own faith. (Mr. Wilson, shout out to you if you're here!) 

In a world where division and hatred are so rampant, I am so happy to have been treated with respect and love by most of my teachers and others that worked at the school. It wasn't what they taught, but it was the way they behaved and conducted themselves with respect, thoughtfulness, and kindness that really gave me such a good impression of the Catholic faith. 

Now when I hear things such as ""Catholics worship Mary"" and all these other misconceptions, I immediately and almost subconsciously find myself jumping to their defence, passing on what I've learned. 

It was a time in my life that I will never forget, and a community that has a special place in my heart. 

Peace and love to you all.

We were always together as active members of our community, especially him. But he has never mentioned before anything about a vocation to celibate. We were soon to be engaged. And now he told me he had felt the calling and must give it a try so that he wouldn't regret not to listen to it and resent me or make me unhappy. I can't be angry at him, I tried to, but I can't. I really love him and want him to be happy. I know he's a wonderful man and will be great at whatever he decides to do. But I am devastated. It was all so sudden and I was left with all these fellings and dreams. I'm glad God has prepared a beautiful path for him and he absolutely deserves all the fullfilness he may find. But what about me? I don't know what path to take, I'm frustrated in my own career, he was the only certain plan I had in my life. He was my bestfriend, my companion, my love and I know I was his. I wish God showed me a path too. I don't know how to pass through all these pain and sadness I'm feeling right now. I have known him since I was 13yo and we started to date when I was 15yo.

We were very young to get married, I had some breakdowns in my life during this time due to family issues and other stuff. We wanted to get married sooner, but we couldn't, and it was a choice made by the two of us together. We also wanted to be financially stable to do it, and in the country we live in, that's not a easy task. Anyways, we had our reasons and, unfortunately, we can't change the past. But I know him very well (at least I thought I knew) and he never seemed afraid of commitment. If he was, I don't think he would be with me for so long. I don't really understand what happened, if anything changed and what the future holds for us.  I guess we'll only know when God wants us to.

We can be happy after a good meal, or sex, or watching a great show. But happiness is a response, and it is fleeting. 

Whereas Joyfulness is a state of being that defines how we respond. It predicates how we engage with events or stimulus.

AstronomerOk4608,0.0,494.0,"I had PTSD and I have clinical anxiety. I suffered a lot a few years ago, and I first tried to deal with my sufferings through excessive pleasure and novelty (i.e. sleeping around a lot, travelling all the time, meeting lots of new people, lots of social events, new hobbies, etc.). I guess from the outside I sort of did look like I was put together. People used to tell me how much they admired me because I, a young woman, travelled so much, and I was always trying new adventures and meeting new people, and I studied hard and partied hard, and I exercised a lot and loved the attention I would get from men. Yet nobody knew that I was constantly busy with new relationships, social activities, hobbies, school, travelling, etc. because I absolutely hated myself. I wanted to escape myself. I couldn't stay alone for too long because I would spiral into a hole of self-hatred and ponder on all the horrible things that happened to me, and be swallowed up by unending guilt and shame.

Once I acknowledged my traumatic events, it led me to have even more panic attacks. The world told me that society was the problem, that everyone else was the problem, and that I had every right to hate society and distrust everyone. I reduced my identity to my sufferings. I was filled with so much anger and hatred. I absolutely hated being a woman. I thought God put me in the wrong body. I cursed my body, I cursed womanhood, I cursed men, I cursed everyone. I cried nearly every single day. I had panic attacks every week. I was suicidal and I often dreamt of killing myself and escaping this horrible world. The pain was swallowing me whole and I was suffocating, I didn't know what to do, I was lost and in agony.

Trauma is a demon, and those of you who have experienced tremendous trauma will understand what I mean. Trauma profoundly changes you mentally, physically and spiritually. Trauma changes your worldview. Trauma turns everything on its head. Trauma is a demon trying to devour your very spirit. Trauma made me feel unsafe in my own body, in my own world, in my own thoughts, in my own head. I wanted to escape all of this. I wanted to die. People will tell you that they are sorry for what you went through, therapists will say that your feelings are valid and to go exercise, and then what? These words did not comfort me and the pleasures of this world could not penetrate my broken heart.

Enter Jesus Christ, my last option. I thought Christianity was oppressive and boring. But I had tried what the world told me to do, and it wasn't working. What did I have to lose by asking God to come and heal me?

And make no mistake, God answers those who call to Him. Christianity tells you to look both at yourself and to Christ. New age spirituality tells you to deaden your feelings to escape the evil of this world. Secularism tells you to self-medicate with the pleasures of this world. But what do you do when this world was the very thing that broke your spirit? And how do you deaden your feelings, when your spirit is already dead? Christianity has taught me to look at myself and to look into heaven. I was able to face the shame, guilt and anger I had inside of me, and I finally let go of them and surrendered myself to God. I know now that the meaning of life is to be a saint. The meaning of life is to do God's will. To be fully human is to be fully divine.

I have learned to look beyond my despair and to look into goodness, beauty and truth -- all of which is Jesus Christ. Christ is the embodiment of Grace and Justice. He has taken my sinful self and nailed it to the cross in His infinite justice. He has risen from the grave, showing victory over my sin and death, in His infinite grace. Christ calls us to a higher life beyond satisfying the sensual desires.

Several religion and philosophy classes in college pushed me to explore Catholicism and Anglicanism, and after much discussion and prayer, I ultimately found that the full fulfillment of truth could be found in Catholicism. A few months ago, I decided to begin RCIA this fall.

My sister leaves for college tomorrow (I'm writing this after midnight though, so today), and I felt that I had to tell everyone while we were all together.

All the yelling and screaming did nothing to change my mind; I'd heard dad's arguments from other people already.

Kajade,0.0,492.0,"So I am 19 yo girl. I am in my last year of high school. I grew up in a non-religious family and in a pretty secular country (Czech republic) - lots of bad things happed here during 40 years of communism in our country, lots of discrimination, killing of christians, destruction of churches. When I was about about 14 yo I was a scout with my friend, we had fun and big camp at end of year, on the camp every sunday we went to catholic church. I obviously wasn't baptised so I just listened to the priest and I couldn't take the communion. I also went a few times to church with my dad when I was younger (8-10) because my grandmother sang in church choir. I also knew two people in my school class who were christians. Fast forward to when I was around 16 I got really interested in religion again and I have decited to read the whole bible (I have never read the bible before). Unfortunately I found a really old translation of bible in my language and it was very archaic to say at least so I was confused, I stopped reading and for about 2 years I lost interest in christianity again and I started to research religions like buddhism, hinduism, judaism, I read a bit of koran after that I was sad again because I didn't find what I was looking for so I returned to researching christianity and than I found a newer translation of bible I bought it and I finally started to understand the bible much better I even started to pray and ask God to guide me. Today I don't have any christian friends but I do know some people in my neigbourhood who are christians. I tried to talk with my family about my faith but they don't understand, they are trying to respect my decision even though mum still thinks that going to church is weird and that I don't need it and can just have my faith for myself. I started to look up churches in my town. There are three churches in my town - two catholic churches (only one is in use) and one evangelical. I thought that I might start my conversion after the end of coronavirus but it seems that it will be here for a long time and I really don't want to wait anymore. I really feel that God is calling me. The churches here are limited but open. I went to the catholic church two times now (alone), just looking around what are some of the peole here like and listening to the sermon of priest. There are many young adults with small children, some older people and even few teenagers. I just can't seem to find the courage to tell the priest about my new found faith and my desire to be baptised.
Please pray for me.
I appreciate any help or advice.

brokenboomerang,0.0,484.0,"Over the weekend I found out that my childhood priest passed away. The vigil was Sunday and the funeral mass was Monday. Since it was streamed due to COVID, I was able to attend both virtually. This has all hit me so much harder than I could have imagined.

I was baptised by him in the city I was born in. When we moved to the suburbs, he happened to transfer to my local parish there. He was present for all my my sacraments through confirmation.

When I graduated, he moved to another church. It was about the same time I stopped attending, then I moved much further away. I never really made a place for church in my life as an adult, but still prayed. Still had a relationship with God.

When I heard about his passing, so many memories came flooding back. I had an awful and abusive childhood. I had never talked to anyone about it, but Father Don gave me the strength and the courage and the hope to get through it. He taught me tolerance and love and acceptance. He was responsible for just about every ideal I carry with me today. I never told him. I never can now.

He taught me that it is never man's place to judge others. That we have no right to condemn, and if God wants to judge others, He will. In the meantime, God is in all of us, and our only job is to love His children. To judge others for their sins is blasphemous as we then hold ourselves equal to God in judgement.

He taught me that I'm never alone. That God is always there for me, cheering me on.

He taught me that God knows what's in my heart. That all He asks is that I live with love in my heart and put others first when I have the capacity to do so.

He taught me that theres no shame in needing help, and that caring for myself is how I can Honour his gifts.

He taught me that there is room for both religion and science and they are intertwined. That curiosity is a gift. Learning is a gift.

He taught me so much. I never doubted his love or that God was with me. I never would have survived or made it this far had he not been such a presence of love and encouragement and acceptance.

There services were lovely. The stories were new and familiar all at once. He lived the Beatitudes with every breath and brought hope to everyone he encountered. 

I've been crying on and off for days. I said the rosary for the first time in years. I am just so overwhelmed with gratitude and sadness and regret and joy that I was lucky enough to have Father Don in my life as I grew up. Theres so much I want to express and prayers don't feel like enough. So. Here I am. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

Rest in Peace in his kingdom, Father Don. You wouldn't have even remembered me, but I'll carry you in my heart forever. You were a man of hope above all else, and that hope saw me through my darkest times.

AstronomerOk4608,0.0,487.0,"So I grew up baptist Christian, then my parents joined an Alliance church, then I joined a non-denominational church, then I kind of became agnostic (or a veryyyy lukewarm Christian let's say). I always thought catholics were the ones with the beautiful churches and beautiful, sacred traditions but my protestant upbringing told me that despite the beauty in catholic practices, they are wrong!!!!!

Now I'm on my way to be catholic. I don't see how someone can learn about church history and not be orthodox or catholic. I understand the difficulty in choosing between the Eastern orthodox church and the roman catholic church, but to choose to be protestant after learning about church history just seems illogical. I do understand that some regions are very anti-catholic (thankfully I live in a culturally catholic place so it's not very difficult for me, although I do have anti-catholic family members), and I really sympathize with them.

Anyway, learning about the Reformation movement is making me really sad. All it was were a bunch of men who claimed to have the correct interpretation of Christianity and of the Bible. Then these men disagreed with one another (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli), and they all sort of branched out from there. Denomination after denomination would be made. Without the authority of the Church, anybody can interpret the Bible as they please, anybody can throw out whatever doctrine or tradition that bothers them, and anybody can start a church so to speak. I heard of this quote somewhere that said, all you need to start a protestant church is a Bible and a pot of coffee. And my goodness, does this seem true...

I do understand that some regions are very anti-catholic (thankfully I live in a culturally catholic place so it's not very difficult for me, although I do have anti-catholic family members), and I really sympathize with them.

Anyway, learning about the Reformation movement is making me really sad. All it was were a bunch of men who claimed to have the correct interpretation of Christianity and of the Bible. Then these men disagreed with one another (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli), and they all sort of branched out from there. Denomination after denomination would be made. Without the authority of the Church, anybody can interpret the Bible as they please, anybody can throw out whatever doctrine or tradition that bothers them, and anybody can start a church so to speak. I heard of this quote somewhere that said, all you need to start a protestant church is a Bible and a pot of coffee. And my goodness, does this seem true... 

Then there were the bloody, horrific religion wars. It's very heartbreaking really... The Body of Christ is so divided, I wish we could all just be one...",learn reformation honestly heartbreaking grow baptist christian parent join alliance church join non denominational church kind become agnostic veryyyy lukewarm christian let say always thought catholic one beautiful church beautiful sacred tradition protestant upbringing told despite beauty catholic practice wrong way catholic see someone learn church history orthodox catholic understand difficulty choose eastern orthodox church roman catholic church choose protestant learn church history seem illogical understand region anti catholic thankfully live culturally catholic place difficult although anti catholic family member really sympathize anyway learn reformation movement make really sad bunch men claimed correct interpretation christianity bible men disagreed one another luther calvin zwingli sort branch denomination denomination would make without authority church anybody interpret bible please anybody throw whatever doctrine tradition bother anybody start church speak heard quote somewhere say need start protestant church bible pot coffee goodness seem true bloody horrific religion war heartbreaking really body christ divide wish could one

repressedboredom,0.0,475.0,"I just want to share an amazing time where the Holy Mother answered my prayer. Sorry long post ahead, this is my first post.

I was on my summer break and was about to start college and I rarely went out so I rarely met with my girlfriend that time. I saw her as a blessing because I could relate to her struggles with her family and the like but the only difference was our faith. I always celebrate the Holy mass during Sundays and I always make time to pray inside every adoration chapel I pass by. She was also a catholic but she rarely went to Church on Sundays and prays only when she feels like it or needs something. I was very conservative and told her that I want to marry her first before having sex and all.

She went to a party during the summer break and she cheated on me. Of course I was devasted and felt like the world was crumbling. The night she told that she cheated and asked for some time off, I couldn't sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about her with another guy and I started to question everything about myself. That was when I saw the rosary a nun gave me in school. Right away I prayed the Rosary. I asked that the Holy Mother join me in prayer right before I start. In every Hail Mary, I added my intention. It went like this:

""Hail Mary full of grace... Mother Mary please pray for her that she'd realize that she doesn't need alcohol, parties and other guy's attention in order to live happily. May she realize that there are other things greater than those and that I can join her in appreciating the other things so we could both be happy. Thank you Mother Mary, I know you are praying with me. Holy Mary...""

I did that for every Hail Mary in the Rosary and kept doing it  the following days along with the memorare. It helped me open my heart and mind to accept whatever may happen next if she leaves.

3 days after that night, I received a text from her right before I was about to sleep. I called her, and she said:

""I'm sorry. I just realized that.. I dont need alcohol, parties and attention from other guys just to be happy. I also realized that there are other things to be happy from. Also I could just drink or party with you or anything and I'm already happy with that.""

At that moment I fell into tears and realized that my prayer has been answered. Word per word exactly as I said it during the Rosary. Right after the phone call I prayed the Rosary again as thank you to the Holy Mother.

We got back together but sadly we're no longer together. Maybe its the Lord's will that we met but not to end up with each other. I am still thankful for that moment and that I met her even if we broke up eventually.

I hope this post helps anyone who is having a hard time right now especially during this pandemic.

theingenuelover,0.0,457.0,"TLDR: Buddhism and Mormonism make me sad because they're weird so I became Catholic because they honor God the way he deserves to be honored. I'm technically a Catholic at heart. 

I know this is not r/exmormon or r/exbuddhist or something like that but this is one of the most supportive and one of my favorite subreddit so I'm gonna say it.

I was born and raised a Buddhist, it's a tiny bit similar to Catholicism so I got used to Catholicism real quick. I don't believe in Buddhism at all because I just...don't ""feel"" it and I was constantly in fear of my actions and sins that I can't just ""confess"". There is a lot of fear in Buddhism growing up. I discovered Catholicism one day through my kindergarten teacher. We were assigned a performance project for Christmas and she chose me to be Mary. I instantly felt a calling..some kind of calling inside me. I was meant to be a saint or something. I was about 7 when I decided to go to mass with my Catholic neighbor and my grandma was not very happy with the fact that I don't believe in Buddhism. I went to mass and I don't understand anything they're saying but I felt like there's lights shining on me unlike going to the temples or pagodas which is pretty cool too but I don't feel the same connection. It's like jogging through a forest in early summer morning with houses near by but everyone's asleep and you're the only one exercising. (If that makes sense lol). I stopped going to mass because grandma wasn't happy. 

When I get to Canada, (I'm Canadian). My family planned to go to church again, but we lived in a fairly Protestant dominated city so we joined this Presbyterian church. I was shocked because they don't honor God the formal way that Catholics do. I basically came there for the food. I quit church because of how ""improper"" it was. I'm basically used to Catholicism.

Years later, I moved to another province and I lived near a Mormon church, a community Spanish church and a Baptist church but I chose the Mormon church because ""well it's big so it must honor God the right way!"" The Mormon church is very formal but I still feel really weird because they have additional books ""Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenant, etc..."" It said really absurd things that my entire year at church was like the Get Out movie without the scary parts. The members are VERY forceful and there's a lot of weird rules that reminded me of the fears I lived with when I was a Buddhist. Church is like 3 hours! The Temple is like a big exclusive club that is VERY exclusive and there are so many secrets that I got a bit worried. It was beautiful though. Catholicism do a lot of ceremonies too but they at least tell other people about it. Mormonism is VERY exclusive. It said really heretical, racist things in the Book of Mormon. You have to be EXTRA HOLY EXTRA RIGHTEOUS to have a temple membership or something. I got depressed and left. My grandma somehow unknowingly gave me a rosary bracelet once and I kept it by me all the time because I felt protected and safe even though it wasn't blessed. It broke last year and I'm wearing the little crucifix on my necklace along with an heirloom because I don't have the heart to throw away the charm even though I always throw away broken, unfixable jewelry no matter how expensive. I just CAN'T throw away this one! 

Right now, I'm a girl in her late teens preparing for her adult life. I have always believed in God in general so I always have a picture of Mormon Jesus with me (they have pretty picture cards that fit my frame). I've always thought I would look good in head coverings but I don't know how, it was like a little nudge from Mary.
One day, I couldn't sleep and I decided to search up Catholic churches. I got invested as if I'm ""coming home"" or something. I woke up next morning and put all of my Mormon books at the back of my closet. I discovered veiling and boy oh boy...my excitement was through the roof!!!! I feel so safe in God and Mary hands. I feel like I've found my home. I had so many Catholic dreams lately and one about Mary talking to me or something. Even though I'm still in a bit of fear about disappointing God because I love him so much, I feel completely safe. The Catholic church really does honor God the RIGHT way the way he deserves to be praised. I love that so much.

Thank you very much, god bless you all.
Stay safe and take care.

I suffer from scrupulosity and often think I'm separated from God and am going to Hell. I often feel physical pain when praying and also when going to church and receiving the Sacrament of Penance. My life has been pretty dark lately, a lot of temptations to despair, little hope in sight. But today I remembered the abundance of the good the Lord has produced in my life. I had strange ""experiences"" multiple times when praying the Rosary. I suddenly became very ""slow"" in pronouncing the words, I felt an overwhelming warm feeling in my chest and felt the ""inside"" of my chest moving, kind of leaping for joy. It was like I was looking at God, and the only thing I can tell you about Him is: He is Goodness, all Goodness. And He also looked at me, and it was like an all-filling presence.

So, I hope that someone reading this will benefit from this short message. I must emphasize, the Lord is good, He *really is* good and He wants all of us to be with Him. Do not be afraid to entrust yourself to Him, for He will give you rest. I was in thick darkness multiple times, but He got me out every time, for He is victorious over all evil.

HarpoonTorpedo999,0.0,444.0,"When I heard of many Neo-Pagans claiming that Christianity killed their cultures and that the church was an extremely cruel and deprave institution, I've started to research of what paganism really is and what are their so called ""civilized"" culture...And I was extremely appalled.....how in the living f*ck is paganism more civilized and benevolent than Christianity!!???

Here are some of the Greco-Pagan practices that I have found horrifying;
&gt;""Those born deformed or physically frail were especially prone to being willfully killed, often by drowning. Some were killed more brutally. For instance, Plutarch (ca. A.D. 46‚Äì120) mentions the Carthaginians, who, he says, ‚Äúoffered up their own children, and those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds; meanwhile the mother stood by without a tear or moan‚Äù (Moralia 2.171D). Cicero (106‚Äì43 B.C.) justified infanticide, at least for the deformed, by citing the ancient Twelve Tables of Roman law when he says that ‚Äúdeformed infants shall be killed‚Äù (De Legibus 3.8). Even Seneca (4 B.C.?‚ÄìA.D. 65), whose moral philosophy was on a higher plane than that of his culture, said, ‚ÄúWe drown children who at birth are weakly and abnormal‚Äù (De Ira 1.15). So common was infanticide that Polybius (205?‚Äì118 B.C.) blamed the population decline of ancient Greece on it (Histories 6). Large families were rare in Greco-Roman society in part because of infanticide.3 Infant girls were especially vulnerable. For instance, in ancient Greece it was rare for even a wealthy family to raise more than one daughter. An inscription at Delphi reveals that one second-century sample of six hundred families had only one percent who raised two daughters.
Historical research shows that infanticide was common not only in the Greco-Roman culture but in many other cultures of the world as well.""

Infanticide was so damn common at that time that time that people treat it as a common occurence. It is even said that life was so cheap in Ancient Greece and Rome that they literally throw babies to cliffs to reduce population and the emperors literally throw fckton of o*gies(Caligula and Nero)

Paganic Galatians worship their Goddess Cybele by castrating the devouts and splashing human blood from executed child to the altar of Cybele. It didn't last long however as Paul of Tarsus preach the word of Christ in Galatia therefore converting them

The daily sacrifice of Nordic Pagans to their altars by randomly picking children in their village, after that they place the child at their altar and SMASH their head with a damn HAMMER to pulp until blood starts gushing

The Inhumane amount of depravity is most shown in Roman Empire where so many damn o*gies are organized by rich patricians. One of the most depraved happenings was when Emperor Nero threw a party to celebrate his emperorship, the party included that the attendants can rape the daughters of the aristocrats without facing consequences, and Emperor Nero encouraged them to relish in immoral humliation saying that it is 'justified' because He told so (Nero proclaimed himself a 'Son of God' or the direct descendant of Apollo therefore his word is a word of god)

In fact even St. Augustine condemned paganism because they see human lives as cheap according to their morality compared to Christianity which says that life is the most sacred

feb914,0.0,435.0,"Yesterday morning I listened to a couple of podcast episodes by Fr Mike Schmitz about going to confession, especially about mortal sin. I haven't done any confession since lockdown and have committed some mortal sins since then, so I felt that this is my calling to go to confession.  

However, my parish was relatively small and there haven't been any confession even though public masses have been made available for the past 1.5 months-ish. Before lockdown there weren't many people going to confession (if there's any) so it didn't surprise me that the priest didn't hold it since he felt there's no demand.  

So I went to church slightly early yesterday (I go to mass on saturdays because my sibling and I are part of choir for that mass) with intention to ask for confession. But I felt quite shy to ask and not sure if the priest would be around early. Turns out when I came in, there were 3 ladies who're asking the priest for confession, so he held an impromptu one in his office (with 2m distancing and mask). I felt that God opened the way for me to do confession. However, there's even more miraculous thing.  

Few minutes later, came a relatively young man who I never saw in the parish, then he asked if there's a confession happening. I told him where the line up is and asked whether he usually go to this parish. He said no, he usually go elsewhere, but he's around the area and felt sudden urge to do confession. Had he come any other weekend, or even half an hour earlier or later, he would have missed the first confession our parish did in the past 4 or so months. For me that's a small miracle.  

Even the priest commented to me that his first time opening confession up in 4 months and there's a lineup. Hope this encourages him to start the weekly confession again.

Empty-Fox9134,0.0,430.0,"This is probably the funniest story that my parents have ever told me, and i thought that I'd share it with all of you guys here on my favorite subreddit.

My mother and father were a young couple at the time of this event, and were on vacation in a major city as a reward for the fact that they had both just graduated from  college. My mother, being a history major, wanted to stop into a museum nearby, and my dad concurred after seeing that they had some special exhibition about eother coca cola or star wars. 
Anywho, they pay their admission, walk around this renound museum until they come across the Catholic Arts room. They wander in and it's the usual scene- lots of kids in Catholic school uniforms flocking around, depictions of saints and Jesus everywhere,  and of course and abundance of visitors. They're just standing around, admiring everything, when the woman in front of them said to her daughter- ""the Catholic church really doesn't like educating people."" 

My mother is so infuriated she can't speak. But my father, maybe driven by spite, the holy spirit, or both, tapped her on the shoulder. ""Ma'am, I'm Catholic,""

""And?"" 
""So's my girlfriend. We're graduates of Yale,"" 
""And what are you saying exactly?"" as the woman sneered this, her daughter was staring up at my dad all confused but semi intrigued.

""You just said, in a room full of Catholic school children who were in a gallery devoted to Catholic Academia, next to 2 catholic Yale graduates, that the church discourages people from getting educated. Now are you SURE that that's the hill you want to die on?"" 

It's with this that the woman drags her daughter away. My mom was laughing like a seal by now, and my dad followed suite. They had to leave the place And go back to their h√¥tel. Where later that night, my father proposed.

After going through some really difficult times when I was around 17, I lost my faith and stopped attending church. I still prayed the rosary simply because I have always found it calming and meditative, but that was about the extent of it. 

Recently my husband and I had our second child, a son, and he was born tiny and somewhat sick. Shortly afterwards I nearly died of an infection and post partum haemorrhage and required surgery and blood transfusions. 

Haemorrhaging was awful, and I quite genuinely thought that it could be the end for me. It‚Äôs difficult to remember, but one of my main thoughts at the time was just to pray. I was terrified, and I just remember praying that God would help me to live for my children and my husband, and that if I didn‚Äôt make it, to please protect them and keep them safe when I was gone. 

Today I took my son to Mass for the first time and thought about that moment a lot. I am so grateful to still be here and thank God every day for the opportunity to watch my children grow up, and to help them have their own faith.

Yesterday at mass my priest gave a very powerful homily that I absolutely did not expect.

He first quoted Cardinal George about how his successors will be persecuted then martyred and then rebuild society. He very bluntly stated that we are living in dark times, have been for some time, and that this transcends politics and goes beyond (in America) Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, and even secular and religious. We are at a point where governments and corporations pose a direct threat to human rights, freedom, the ability to speak Truth, and how it is the Church's responsibility to uphold these things wherever she may be.

He then went on to describe that regardless of your opinion of the election or of politics, Joe Biden will be the next President. Whether or not you like this or think this it is legitimate, it is our duty as Catholics to pray for him as he leads our country.

That said, he stately bluntly that Biden has endorsed policies that are contrary to Catholic teaching (ie abortion) and in doing so has caused scandal as a self proclaimed Catholic. Because of this, my priest stated that if Biden were to come to this parish and attempt to receive communion, he would deny him as any good priest should in accordance with Church teaching. As Catholics we must encourage each other to abide by the Church even for, and especially for, our leaders.

He then finished by referencing the Cristero War in Mexico and the martyrdom that occurred. We should all live so that our last words may be ""Viva Cristo Rey!""

While there were plenty of people who seemed moved by this homily, an older women in her 60s came to him after mass and yelled at him. She said to him that ""Trump was worse, that the Church's teachings on abortion are years old and should be updated, that the Church has no right telling people what to do and is about acceptance, and that homilies like this are why less people come to Church"". My priest was very polite in responding and correcting each of these statements and stood by his words.

[deleted],0.0,417.0,"Hi everyone,

Regrettably I will be deleting my account soon, as a result of ongoing harassment from Reddit users.

I have shared articles and posted my views about the ongoing Cardinal Pell matter in some Australian local subreddits, as well as here, for some time. I expect downvotes and carry-on within the thread, however the extent of harassment and abuse I have received, as well as attempts to doxx me from my Reddit history, is unprecedented, and is impacting my mental wellbeing. I'm not in danger, but no one should have to go through it.

This subreddit, /r/Catholicism, was a great help for me coming back to my faith as a high school student about five years ago, and I'm pleased to see it doing the same work for others every day. This is truly one of the most pleasant places on Reddit, free from obscene jokes and content. All owing to the solid users who commit their participation, and the moderators who actively maintain it. I wanted to thank all of you who treat visitors to this subreddit with charity and earnestness. You are doing more good than you may realise, through a means that gives more opportunities to provide charity and good counsel than can be imagined offline.

God bless.",0,Will be deleting my account,417.0,0.96,"Will be deleting my account Hi everyone,

Regrettably I will be deleting my account soon, as a result of ongoing harassment from Reddit users.

I have shared articles and posted my views about the ongoing Cardinal Pell matter in some Australian local subreddits, as well as here, for some time. I expect downvotes and carry-on within the thread, however the extent of harassment and abuse I have received, as well as attempts to doxx me from my Reddit history, is unprecedented, and is impacting my mental wellbeing. I'm not in danger, but no one should have to go through it.

To me this implies that people don't seem to want to send their children there.

Unless the Church catechizes the youth effectively, very few are going to grow up and desire to send their children to a school operated by the Church.

***There are not one hundred people in the United  States who hate The Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate  what they wrongly perceive the Catholic Church to be.***

So it's no wonder people don't see the value in an education provided by the Church - they don't really even know what the Church is or teaches. If you could go back and quiz a 16 year old me I shudder to think of how I'd answer various basic questions about the faith. Even for kids who go to public school when they do have access to a formal catechism class, there's little substance provided and even less that differentiates Catholicism from any other Christian church. Oh, and less still that offers any compelling reason to stay beyond a few ""feel good"" moments.

Today has been terribly difficult. I talked to both a priest at our parish and the national catholic bioethics center. Both sources actually gave the same information regarding methotrexate vs surgery: there is no official teaching recognized by the Catholic church on this matter. Ethicists are torn on the subject for methotrexate use for an ectopic pregnancy. We were given the guidance to pray and make a decision that we believe is the best by using our well formed conscience. From this, we ended up feeling a lot more comfort and confidence in our decision. 

The guidance from these sources differed significantly from the advice given on this subreddit. I am certain that many on this subreddit believe that we have gravely sinned. I was given reassurance by our priest that we would not be in sin with either choice. After the fact, I read some of the replies on this subreddit out loud to my wife. They made her sob. She cried and said that she can't imagine that the God she knows would be asking her to undergo a dangerous surgery for her that will also reduce her fertility dramatically.

My wife quickly came to the conclusion that she would take the methotrexate. We decided to take the safest route to preserve my wife's health and safety. As soon as she made this decision, I felt so much releif. The only image that has been in my mind most of the day is the thought of my beautiful, young wife struggling for breath with a breathing to strapped to her face in the ICU surrounded by COVID patients. We are horrified of anything that could cause a relapse in her myasthenia gravis because it has been really well controlled recently. 

I'm confident in our decision. I don't think I could have chosen to have surgery if I were in my wife's place, so how could I have asked her to do exactly what I'm not brave enough to do myself.

Also the bullying experience was practically the worst it had at ever been at my life. I committed a lot of sins just by thoughts alone. 

My mentality at this point started to get worse. I started sharing Anti-Catholic memes and even subscribed to podcasts dedicated to downgrading Catholicism. Freshman-Junior year I went very low. Depression was a huge problem at the time, and I couldn‚Äôt cope with it all. Than I met a gentleman who I will call, ‚ÄúSimon‚Äù for privacy reasons. This was near the end of senior year.

fancydrank,0.0,366.0,"I think the nuance of this issue cannot be overstated. I seen it posted multiple times on the subreddit that voting for a candidate that is pro-choice is a mortal sin. I'd venture to say a large number of Christians *believe* this and it ends up causing a lot of cognitive dissonance. 

Although the importance of this issue may tempt us to avoid any risks of worsening an already significant issue, it cannot justify misinformation.


""34. Catholics often face difficult choices about how to vote. This is why it is so important to vote according to a well-formed conscience that perceives the proper relationship among moral goods. A Catholic cannot vote for a candidate who favors a policy promoting an intrinsically evil act, such as abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, deliberately subjecting workers or the poor to subhuman living conditions, redefining marriage in ways that violate its essential meaning, or racist behavior, if the voter's intent is to support that position. In such cases, a Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in grave evil. At the same time, a voter should not use a candidate's opposition to an intrinsic evil to justify indifference or inattentiveness to other important moral issues involving human life and dignity.""

huckdr,0.0,356.0,"I had posted a few days back that I hadn't been to Confession in 15+ years. Just before Christmas, I had been going through some tough times (mentally, physically, spiritually) and had reached out to my late Grandfather's sister, who is a nun, after she sent a Christmas letter to the family saying to get in touch if anyone needed prayers. I was in so much emotional pain, I was moved to tears and wrote her a long letter. 

A few days after Christmas, my spirits had lifted. I felt a transformation like I had never experienced before. I remember taking a walk at a park in the sunshine and wanted to scream from the mountaintops that joy had returned to my life. 

About two weeks ago, she sent me an email saying she had been praying for me and was asking the Holy Spirit for the right words to say to me. She recommended three books to help me get back in touch with knowing Jesus. I a few days later, I went to visit her at the convent, she showed me the chapel, and we prayed together. I got the three books from her; read one in a week (""Jesus: A Pilgrimage"" by Rev. James Martin) and currently working on the two others.

Something moved me in spirit and realized it had been a long time since I'd been to Confession. I got some great encouragement from this forum and a few users. I made a plan and worried for a few days; I was that anxious. 

I went to the Church early today and sat there in my thoughts and prayer. The priest was kind and welcomed me back. He gave me some advice on additional spiritual direction. I hope I made his day.

Anyway, it feels good to have faced my anxieties and used my faith to get through what I set my mind to. My nephew is making his first Communion in a month or so. I hope to be a good example for him as his Godfather and bring him to Mass soon with my brother.

On Sunday I went to Mass for the first time in many years, and even though I struggled to remember the prayers and responses, and had to wait for everyone else to say their part before I could softly whisper them to myself, I felt more at home than I have ever felt. The homily was all about how it was the first Sunday of Advent, and to be honest, I had been away so long that I had forgotten about Advent. The priest spoke of how this is the time to prepare for the arrival of Christ, and in the midst of my journey, I found it incredibly fitting.

LawUntoChaos,0.0,353.0,"Hi Everyone,

I am deeply sorry to the Catholic community. I was raised Catholic and fell out of faith. I blamed the evils of the world on religion but I now see that the evil is within individual hearts and false prophets.

I did not have a good time in Catholic school. I found it restrictive and suffocating. However, I have always strived to be humble and have always thought of Jesus as an aspiring figure. The forgiveness and wisdom that is still relevant today embodief by his actions. I love the fact that he held no one in contempt, that he never seeked to destroy even those that would harm him.

My favourite story:

 &gt;Matthew 9:20-22

&gt; King James Version

&gt; 20¬†And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:

&gt; 21¬†For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.

&gt; 22¬†But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.

He never begrudge anyone their suffering and forgave her for taking his power in faith.

I used to hate religion then I saw the value in it and claimed myself agnostic. I have now found faith again and am deeply sorry for the generalisations that I put onto religion as a whole.

I don't know if I fully believe, but I want to believe. Not only that but I want to be as decent, brave and compassionate as I am able. Not to hold it over anyone but to remember and honour where these ideas came from. I don't want to assume my good, I want to actively work toward it. 

I'd like to return to the Catholic faith and I ask forgiveness, not for losing faith (as I believe that is up to the person) but questioning yours.

Thanks for taking the time to read my story.",0,An Apology from a Prodigal Son,353.0,0.98,"An Apology from a Prodigal Son Hi Everyone,

Due to an large amount of threads about COVID-19, we are establishing a megathread to keep the subreddit from being flooded by an overabundance of discussions about the topic. Please keep all new conversations about the virus in this thread.

Please pay attention to your local governmental health organizations and follow the guidelines they put out. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to get caught up in the sensationalism that can be found in the news and social media.


We have put together some Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 and how it relates to your obligations and rights in the Church. Hopefully this can help answer any doubts that people may have.


**What is COVID-19?**

‚ÄúAt the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV."" - Uptodate's page on CoVID

This virus has been compared to the flu; which is an inaccurate comparison for a couple of reasons. CoVID tends to spread more than the flu and has a higher mortality rate than the flu; which means this new pathogen is a public health danger that demands our attention. More importantly, the healthcare system has not factored in this new pathogen which raises the risk of hospitals getting overwhelmed; which is really the main threat posed by CoVID. In other words, our response to the virus determines how things will pan out more than anything, which is why experts recommend immediate enforcement of social distancing measures to relieve stress from hospitals. With proper social distancing procedures, CoVID's mortality and burden becomes manageable, as South Korea has so aptly shown. 

The virus mainly spreads through respiratory droplets and also through surfaces; so maintain a safe distance from others, avoid large groups, avoid touching your face, and keep your hands clean. If enough people undertake these measures, the virus' spread will slow which will allow hospitals to process the cases that pop up efficiently. This graphic illustrates this point: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES2zmPVUcAAYXDB?format=png and this twitter thread may be helpful as well: https://twitter.com/AbraarKaran/status/1237851055632703495

If youhave symptoms of any viral illness, call and coordinate with your doctor before showing up to a hospital to avoid infecting others or catching an infection.

*In all cases refer to medical/health experts and do not rely upon the subreddit for your physical well being, these are just helpful reminders/guidelines.*



**What are the guidelines for not attending Mass?**

The Catechism, paragraph 2181, says:

&gt; The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, *unless excused for a serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by their own pastor.* Those who deliberately fail in this obligation commit a grave sin.

If you are sick, you should not attend Mass out of respect for those around you so that you do not spread your illness to them. You do not have to go to Mass if you are sick; you do not need to ask your pastor‚Äôs permission for this.

If you are in one of the groups that is particularly at risk for contracting and suffering seriously from COVID-19, or regularly interact with people in this group (e.g. you‚Äôre a caretaker for an elderly person, you work in a hospital, etc) and there are a number of confirmed cased in your area, this also is a serious reason to be able to miss Mass. The reasons listed in the catechism are not exhaustive. If you are in doubt, consult with your pastor.

**Can I just watch Mass on TV?**

Watching Mass online or on TV does not fulfill your obligation, but if you are excused from attending for one of the above reasons it is an admirable practice to make a spiritual communion while watching a broadcast of Mass.

**Do I have to receive communion?**

You do not have to receive communion at Mass. While you are obliged to attend Mass each Sunday (unless  one of the factors as discussed above applies), you are only obliged to receive communion once a year during Easter time. [(canon 920)](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=920)


**Can my bishop forbid me from receiving on the tongue?**

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, paragraph 160, says

&gt; The consecrated host may be received either on the tongue or in the hand, at the discretion of each communicant.

*Redemptionis Sacramentum*, paragraph 92, says

&gt; ...each of the faithful always has the right to receive Holy Communion on the tongue, at his choice...

It is your choice whether you want to receive on the hand or on the tongue. A local bishop does not have the authority to overrule these universal documents. If you would like to receive on the tongue but a priest or EMHC refuses you, it is advisable to gently remind the person of your right but to be docile. If your right is not respected, you can bring the situation to the bishop or Apostolic Nuncio.

**Isn‚Äôt receiving on the hand more sanitary?**

The [Archdiocese of Portland](https://d2y1pz2y630308.cloudfront.net/12494/documents/2020/3/Cold%20and%20Flu%20Liturgy.pdf) consulted two doctors, one of whom was an immunologist. They concluded that:

&gt; ... done properly, the reception of Holy Communion on the tongue or in the hand pose a more or less equal risk. The risk of touching the tongue and passing the saliva on to others is obviously a danger however the chance of touching someone‚Äôs hand is equally probable and one‚Äôs hands have a greater exposure to germs.

No matter how one receives, it must be done so reverently to respect our Lord and properly so that germ transmission is minimal. For reception on the hand, this means placing one hand on top of the other with a flat palm; if your hand is cupped even slightly, it is more likely the minister will touch your hand. For receiving on the tongue, this means sticking out your tongue as far as possible and leaning your head back slightly to give the minister the largest surface area to aim for.

**God wouldn‚Äôt let germs be transmitted at Mass or through the Eucharist, would He? The Eucharist is a miracle!**

The Baltimore Catechism #1154 says

&gt;we must carefully guard against expecting God to perform miracles when natural causes may bring about what we hope for. God will sometimes miraculously help us, but, as a rule, only when all natural means have failed.

We should not commit the sin of presuming God‚Äôs grace; we can and should take all precautions that we humanly can, while still praying for divine intervention.



**In closing**

Let us pray for an end to this disease outbreak, and for our brothers and sisters affected by it.

O God, who wills not the death of the sinner,  
but that he should repent:  
welcome with pardon Your people's return to You,  
and so long as they are faithful in Your service,  
and in Your clemency withdraw the scourge of Your wrath;  

Almighty ever-living God, eternal health of believers,  
hear our prayers for Your servants who are sick:  
grant them we implore You, Your merciful help,  
so that, with their health restored,  
they may give You thanks in the midst of your Church;  

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,  
who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit,  
one God, forever and ever.

cantayma,0.0,350.0,"I made a previous post about a bad experience in confession ten years ago that made me feel unforgiven and unable to take the Eucharist. Now I am married to Protestant and have a baby. I was encouraged to try Reconciliation again after feeling nudged for many months.

I went this evening and had a wonderful experience with a priest who showed so much mercy and grace.

I am able to take communion once again. My questions about moving forward with convalidation of my marriage and Baptism for my boy were answered. The solution was more simple than I had expected. 

However, I realized once I got home that my husband was unaware of what I meant when I said, ""I am going to Confession today."" We have talked about my return to the Catholic church, but he did not see it coming today. Happily, he agreed to validate our marriage in the Catholic church. But he is still pretty angry and confused at the moment. He is concerned about how we will raise our boy and the wedge that is now in our family. He and his family are pretty anti-Catholic. 

I do not disagree that we have a looming conflict, but I am not afraid or worried. God is capable of solving the most complex problems. This is nothing for him. Our boy will be Baptized in a way that both our churches recognize, that is enough for now. The rest will come. I will be praying with Saint Paul in mind.

My wife's grandparents (along with our old church) view me as being confused by the devil and that I've brainwashed their granddaughter, even though she has told them she wants to convert. It's been pretty rough for her in that regard.

My family is against it, but they respect our decision to become Catholic, there isn't much strife there which is good.

My workplace has become very rough. All but 2 people are now against me, so much so that one of the higher ups had to get others to leave me be. I went from being one of three people allowed to teach at our company's Bible study to being someone who ""follows the devil"". I've been the source of jokes and mocking for weeks.

[deleted],0.0,335.0,"I grew up in a home where my father was Roman Catholic and my mother was Methodist. My father attended Catholic school his whole life and then served 8 years in the Marines before being discharged for the loss of his left eye. He always told me that the nuns in Catholic school were tougher than the Marine drill instructors at Parris Island. He never liked to attend church, but would go to my mother's Methodist church where she taught Sunday School and where I was baptized. When we moved 20 minutes away from where I was born, we went to the Methodist church in my new town. Then switched to a Presbyterian church.

My assistant baseball coach was the Presbyterian minister and his church was closer to our home. My mother became very active in that church, mostly because she had a hard time saying, ""No,"" when asked to volunteer. She taught Sunday School there as well, sang in the choir, filled in at the organ when needed because she was a piano tutor, and became an elder. I was confirmed Presbyterian.

She was a college professor at a private Catholic college where I attended because it was mostly free with tuition benefits she earned for her family. This is where I was first exposed to Catholicism. Half the classes were taught by priests and nuns. I majored in English Lit and minored in philosophy and religious studies. Although, to say that I majored in lacrosse and minored in co-eds would probably be as accurate. They don't put that on one's diploma.

I've never met a more forgiving group of people than Catholic clerics and laity. Coming from the world of Protestantism, it was more puritanical. The church ladies ran the show behind the scenes and were often judgmental. Sins were intolerable, so there was no support system.

One of my favorite teachers was a priest who was good at basketball, rumored to have a bookie, had a TV show on EWTN, and was like a guy's guy. While not Catholic, I couldn't go to confession, but we certainly had our share of conversations outside of class where he took the time to minister to a group of us who were like the crew from *Dead Poets Society.* Our college chaplain was another great priest who used to swim laps every night at the pool where I worked as a lifeguard. He would always take time to chat and dish out fatherly advice. The nuns were also super great, filled with humor, and much different than my father described. Of course, this was college and not K-12.

I dated Catholic girls and went to mass. My only criticism of Catholicism is the push to raise money. I was used to a collection plate quietly passed in Protestant churches. Priests often really ""sold it"" to get donations from the pulpit.

But, what I really love about Catholicism is the structure and the Papacy. Protestantism is chaos. I couldn't even name all of the denominations. Worse, I do not agree with the policies such as same-sex marriage being condoned by the Presbyterian church. I don't have a problem with the LGBT community, I just can't justify how my denomination (and the Methodists may do the same soon) can allow ministers to perform same-sex weddings when the Bible is clear on homosexuality (at least among men) being a sin.

I see the Catholic Church as a strong entity not willing to cave to social pressure. Sure. The Church isn't perfect and could have handled things better such as the pedophilia problem among some priests, but we've learned that just about every organization that has dealt with children in the post-modern age hasn't been immune. I'm sure the Church of Rome will grow from this, find a solution to the problem, and continue the Lord's work.

I know there is so much other criticism directed at the faith since the church is claimed to have money. But, if that were the case, so many diocese wouldn't be struggling.

Then they stopped chanting and everyone went into a line and started walking slowly, not knowing what was going on I just joined them until I was standing in front of the priest who gave me something to eat, I just allowed him to feed me and then went back to my seat.

Here's a really, really long and rambling conversion story if you want to read: 

I'm Chinese, both of my parents are members of the CCP and my grandparents are cultural Buddhists. Naturally my primary and secondary education was 100% atheist. Christianity, not to mention Catholicism, is probably never expected to be part of my world

When I was 9 years old my parents bought me a large book, a collection of stories and poems aimed for children, originally compiled by an American and translated into Chinese. It was in this book that I first encountered several stories from the Gospels, the life story of St.Maximilian Kolbe, the 23rd psalm, various poems about faith and God, prayers, etc. At that time I only had some rudimentary knowledge about Christianity from school and from other readings, but these writings moved and awed me, so much that after reading the 23rd psalm I tried for the first time to pray to the God these people described. 

Soon I started to search for ""Christianity' and ""Christian websites' behind my parents' back. I even managed to find a copy of Bible in my house, the book was older than myself - it probably came from my parents' university days, and the printing format was difficult for me to read. There's another book in our home called 'An Introduction to the world of God', which is just a mish-mash of random information about Christianity, for example the author's description of the Fall was entirely based on Paradise Lost, and hell was based on Inferno. I managed to finish a 'Stories from the Bible' kind of book and half of the translated Bible online during those days. I visited many websites, some of them were pretty weird, often made by strange underground Protestant family churches in China. I remember one of them told me one should never to go church and read Bible on one's own instead, because all modern day churches are corrupted by the devil. 

After 1 year of aimless searchings I finally summoned up the courage to tell my mum 'I want to be a Christian', and her first reaction was a chuckle. Then she asked me 'how much do you know about Christianity? """"What kind of Christian do you want to be? "" She never treated it as a serious thought, but still she helped me to find some articles about church history. At that time we happen to live right next to a Catholic church, one of the four Catholic churches on Beijing, we've entered the church once or twice, but I was too shy to go inside on my own and too unsure to ask adults to take me there. After another year of research and considerations it started to appear to me that Catholicism is the right path, the one true religion to follow.

Then I stopped there. I was around 11 or 12 then, again I was too shy and scared to actually talk to the priests in the church, I've heard about RCIA but joining RCIA lesson will mean that my dad will bound to know my little religion activities, and to me he's a loyal Party member and a stern father. Also I worried what would my classmates think or other adults think. And what if my idea will change as I grow older ? Will my parents ever allow me to spend time on classes as useless as RCIA ? 

So I waited and waited, in the meantime becoming increasingly interested in European medieval history and history of the Catholic church to want to go study abroad. From time to time I had doubts about God or salvation, once or twice I threw my bible under my bed and tell myself these ""Catholic stuff' is only a childhood fancy, but these thoughts never really left me. By the time I was 14 or 15 my classmates started to join the Communist Youth League, the youth group that every highschool student was expected to join. I was among the first student in my class to be nominated for the membership, by the time I graduated from middle school I was among the only 2 or 3 students in my class (of 45 people) that didn't join. 

I reached 16, and my life took a big turn as mum decide to send me to study abroad, in a boarding school in UK. For the first time in my life I no longer need to think about what will my parents think or what will other adults think, no one here knew me and I can be a completely different person. But my highschool was really secular, not a single priest/minister/reverent to be found, not to mention being located in the middle of nowhere. There's a school bus to take students to the nearby  city every Sunday morning, and I took the chance to go to see the mass, but it's impossible to participate in more church activities. We do have a Christian Union at school - mostly Protestant and Evangelical, lead by our lovely maths teacher who married a Korean evangelical preacher. I ended up becoming one of the exec of Christian Union, organizing bible study groups and volunteering projects, which is so ironic as I was not even baptised. 

During my first year in uni (still in UK)  I approached my dad for the first time to talk about 'Dad I want to join the Catholic faith', which I should have done years and years ago. He was understandably shocked, spent the next weeks trying to talk me off this fancy, arguing with me and my mum. I was seriously shaken by these arguments, not because he said ' why can't you be like other normal young people ? "" ""both me and your mother have been  upright party members, what has gone wrong with our education? "" but because I realised having a Catholic daughter can affect his career. He's a civil servant in a CCP administration, and if his superiors find out - 'how come that as a cadet of the Party your own daughter had converted to Catholicism?""  . And how can I allow this to happen ? 

In the end my dad still think converting to Catholicism is strange, but he said he'll support me if this is what I really want, after all. And he's still a little disappointed that I will never become a member of the CCP and thus probably never enter the country's establishment, on the other hand, he knew that I'm too much of a liberal ( 'liberal' as oppose to authoritarianism and Chinese traditionalism) dissenter to join the Party willingly, baptized or not. ""My colleagues may not find out if you got your baptism in the UK, ' he said,  'and I'm going to retire within a few years so there's not much hope of promotion for me anyway. "" 

So I was scheduled to be baptized in my second year, but during that time I was diagnosed with depression and had to take 6 months off study. So it was put off til Easter this year, but then covid happened. I said to my parish priest that 'It's almost like our Lord is throwing obstacles after obstacles in front of me, so I can realise that whatever what happen he'll always stick to me. Always, like, literally."" 

And sometimes I think maybe, maybe someone somewhere in this world or the next had been praying for the spread of the Gospels and the conversion of other people, and one of his/her prayers is being realised through me. 

Anyway now that churches are partly reopened and I'm back in UK, I'm finally going to be baptised this coming Sunday. 12 years after the first time I came across the 23rd psalm in a book for children, and 5000 miles away from home.
