I'm a felon bartender with a useless degree, and the pittance of a contribution to my 401k my paychecks provide is just mathematically insignificant.

**How I send mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi Cold Wallet?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

&amp;#x200B;

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 1)**

I tried to contact Huobi's customer support. First they first didn't understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn't belongs to Huobi and they can't help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:

&amp;#x200B;

**Huobi Ownership Analysis**

Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn't belongs to Huobi

I don't know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D

Then, is VERY PROBABLY THAT 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 OWNER KNOWS 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER And the 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER can help me.

Searching, some sites (and sites like USDT Official page [https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)) says that the address 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D belongs to Huobi

Again, I don't know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past

2018-05-08 18:36:45 , txid: 0e6bf02323ebc166b6638afcd6170ecb73948748235e687def7e7a3cb1902fca , it has 239 inputs 2018-05-08 20:17:10 , txid: b59b988d642fe3773268e246ef1a0d048bbd3f734a611d00722b39126ed9e20b , it has 239 inputs too

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

The coronavirus shutdown is hammering supply and demand across the globe. That has forced the real economy into a sharp recession and triggered a rolling financial crisis. Below is a primer on one key piece of this mess: the crisis in corporate debt markets. This branch of finance is vitally important because even healthy companies often need access to credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

In 2008, the vector of crisis ran from mortgage-backed securities to the rest of the financial sector and then to the real economy. This time, the real economy is being hit directly, and the damage is reverberating back into financial markets.  The failing markets, in feedback-loop fashion, further threaten the real economy as corporations find it harder to borrow. As the corporate debt markets sour, major companies will go bankrupt. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Some analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualized rate of 30 percent during the second quarter of 2020.

Already, US financial markets are on public life support. The Federal Reserve has committed to unlimited purchases of all sorts of assets: US Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, car loans, municipal debts, and, in a historic step, both short term and long-term corporate debt. But the crisis will require more than a financial rescue.

The key political question now is: What sort of controls will come with the state intervention? Corporate greed and self-dealing need to be checked not merely in the name of fairness but also to make sure public bailout money is actually invested in the real economy rather than just gambled away, as it was after the 2008 crash and rescue.

###The Rise of Corporate Debt

Since 2008, household debt levels have actually declined and are now lower than they were going into the last crash. But not corporate debt. Measured as a firm‚Äôs ‚Äúnet debt‚Äù compared to its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), corporate debt has doubled since the last crash. In 2009, the average American company owed $2 of debt for every $1 in earnings. Today, the average firm carries net debt to EBITDA of 3 to 1, and many firms ‚Äî like Ford Motor, CarMax, Harley-Davidson, and General Motors ‚Äî carry ratios ranging from 8 to 1, to as high as 15 to 1. Boeing, a special case because of its 737 MAX crisis, carries a ratio of 37 to 1.

Over the last two decades, corporate America‚Äôs credit rating has collapsed. In the early ‚Äô90s, more than sixty companies held AAA credit ratings. Today, only two US firms are AAA rated: Johnson &amp; Johnson and Microsoft. In 2001, fewer than one in five ‚Äúinvestment-grade‚Äù firms were rated BBB. Today half of all investment-grade corporate debt belongs to firms rated ‚Äútriple-B‚Äù (BBB) or lower. A third of those firms are rated triple-B minus (BBB-), one notch away from speculative or ‚Äújunk‚Äù status.

Already many triple-B-rated corporate bonds are trading on secondary markets at unusually low prices and high yields, often above 5 percent; that means even ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù bonds are being treated as junk. Soon many triple-B-rated corporations will be formally downgraded to junk. That will drive up their borrowing costs and restrict their access to credit. Even healthy companies often need access to ready credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

The rating agency Moody‚Äôs estimates the default rate for ‚Äúspeculative-grade‚Äù debt ‚Äî companies with ratings lower than Baa from Moody‚Äôs Investors Service, or a rating lower than BBB from Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs ‚Äî might reach 10 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent last year. The consequences of all this will reverberate throughout the wider economy, deepening and extending the recession.

Total global corporate debt, including bonds and loans, is approximately $66 trillion; more than double what it was a decade ago. For comparison, the combined gross national product of all economies was estimated at $80.27 trillion in 2017. About a quarter of that is the US economy.

###What They Did With the Money

After the 2008 crash, the world‚Äôs central banks, with the US Federal Reserve in the lead, spent the next decade pushing money into the financial markets by way of super-low interest rates and the direct public purchase of financial assets from the private sector via quantitative easing (QE).

The cheap credit encouraged lots of corporate borrowing in the form of loans from banks and massive issuance of corporate bonds. Unlike loans, which can be routinely extended, or sometimes abruptly terminated, or have interest rates that float up and down, corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company committing to repay borrowed money on a specified schedule at a specified, usually fixed, rate of interest.

Corporations have been borrowing for a variety of reasons that range from shrewd arbitrage to stupid and reckless asset stripping. For a struggling and unprofitable company, for example JCPenney, debt can be a lifeline. For a profitable firm, borrowing money can be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders‚Äô claim on the company‚Äôs profits, which would happen if the firm issued stock.

Even some profitable firms with piles of cash borrowed rather than spend their cash, in part for the firepower effect: letting other competitors and market entrants know that the firm has enough money on hand to buy out any threatening start-ups, and showing the world the firm is ready to ride out any economic crisis.

Some firms used their borrowed money to buy other firms. This helped fuel a post-2008 wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Deloitte reported ‚Äúmore than $10 trillion in [M&amp;A] domestic transactions since 2013.‚Äù Targeted companies borrowed to stockpile cash as a defense against such takeovers.

Firms also borrowed to fund CEO compensation, distributions to investors via dividends, and stock buybacks. Companies buy back their own stock so as to boost its price. A rising stock price is useful in many ways: it can keep away hostile raiders by making a targeted company too expensive to take over, but it can also draw in friendly suitors because (with some creative accounting) a rising stock value can make a weak firm appear more profitable. Corporate executives like a rising stock price because compensation packages are both tied to stock performance and almost always include some payment in company stock, so the higher the stock price, the higher the executives‚Äô payout.

Sometimes, firms even invested their borrowed money in actual production. The capital-intensive oil and gas industry did that, but as we explain below, it still faces a crisis, perhaps more salient than other sectors.

###Bad Credit as Perverse Incentive

The end result of all the borrowing was declining corporate credit-worthiness: corporate debt soon badly outpaced their earnings growth and cash balances. This led to widespread credit-rating downgrades.

Perversely, lower credit ratings did not slow the borrowing binge, but rather spurred on further lending and borrowing, because as corporate credit ratings slipped, the interest rate that the downgraded firms had to pay on their loans and bonds increased. And, thus, so too did the lenders‚Äô profits.

Corporate debt and stock prices entered into a twisted dialectic, each driving the other. As the stock market continued to inflate over the last decade, it provided the confidence investors required to continue their purchases of risky corporate bonds.

Keep in mind that many of the lending banks and asset funds were actually or essentially borrowing from Uncle Sam at inflation-adjusted rates close to zero, then lending to companies with triple-B and triple-B minus ratings at 5 percent interest. Profits like that meant there were always banks and asset funds eager to lend to debt-burdened corporations.

Investors could directly purchase specific corporations‚Äô bonds, or, as is more often the case, invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target an array of corporate bonds. High-risk loans were also sliced and diced and repackaged into bundles called ‚Äúcollateralized loan obligations‚Äù (CLOs), a class of securities backed by an underlying portfolio of corporate loans.

According to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the majority of American CLOs are held by US institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds, and depository institutions. This means that when the debt is unable to be serviced, the pain will be absorbed within the US economy, much of it by the unassuming customers of these financial behemoths.

As was the case with the mortgage-backed securities of the 2008 crash, these funds helped ‚Äúdistribute risk‚Äù and thus gave an appearance of safety. The logic was that owning 1 percent of a hundred different loans would be safer, even if some loans went bad, than owning the entirety of a single debt security. The logic is not entirely wrong. And that is part of the problem: it encouraged yet more lending. As long as the economic forecast was optimistic, there was no reason for the debt spree to let up.

###Zombies and Others

Corporate debt, like much of the economy, is a story of disparities. Not every corporation is burdened by debt. Some firms are actually awash in cash. Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet Inc, and Apple each sit on more than $100 billion in cash. As a whole, corporate America has been sitting on record amounts of cash in recent years. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley Investment Management estimates that one in six US companies cannot cover even the interest payments on their debts.

At the heart of the problem are ‚Äúleveraged loans‚Äù and so-called zombie firms. Leveraged loans are a type of expensive, high-risk credit extended to already heavily indebted companies. Since the 2008 crash, the leveraged loan market has doubled to $1.2 trillion. Now, leveraged loans in the United States are being re-sold at only 84 cents on the dollar, their lowest price since August 2009. The majority of leveraged loans ‚Äî more than half ‚Äî are in the form of the aforementioned CLOs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were $617 billion of CLOs outstanding.

Zombie firms are defined by the Bank for International Settlements as heavily indebted, well-established companies that have failed to be profitable over an extended period and have low expected profitability in the future. In other words, heavily indebted start-ups do not qualify as zombies. The most threatened sectors are energy, automotive, insurance, capital goods (meaning equipment and machinery), telecoms, aerospace and defense, and some parts of retail.

The bull market of rising, often overvalued, stock prices allowed many uncompetitive and unprofitable companies to appear healthy based solely on their stock‚Äôs performance. Even before the markets started to crash on March 9, some analysts were prescient enough to call the market‚Äôs bluff at the beginning of the year.

But in this rapidly developing crisis, firms all across the economy may soon find it impossible to meet their liabilities. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains and forcing massive constrictions in consumer demand, corporate earnings are contracting fast, which in turn will badly hurt corporate debt servicing.

Like a hypertrophied organ rupturing, the putrefaction of unsustainable corporate debt now threatens to create a generalized economic sepsis that will hurt even healthy firms.

###Profiles in Debt

Airlines. The top six major US airlines spent enormous sums to buy back their stock over the last decade. US airlines (as a whole) spent 96 percent of their borrowed money on buying back stock. Now, revenue from flights is plummeting. United Airlines‚Äô bookings have fallen by 70 percent. Back in 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 billion in liabilities; today, they have over $34 billion in debt. Yields on some of their bonds reached a whopping 12 percent, a particularly distressing sign as interest rates have been slashed by the Fed in an effort to relieve credit markets.

Energy. Even before the effects of coronavirus eviscerated demand for fossil fuels, US energy companies were suffering due to high fixed costs and low energy prices. In the last five years, 208 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy. Energy prices have been pushed down by the fracking revolution, the rise of renewable energy, and oil overproduction due to struggles between large producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.

Now the coronavirus shock is pushing firms over the edge. Occidental Petroleum ‚Äî which has $40 billion in debt, while its market value (the value of all of its stocks combined) is less than $11 billion ‚Äî recently had its debt downgraded to junk.

Energy mutual funds reveal the crisis in the energy sector as a whole. Vanguard Energy Fund, considered one of the top four oil mutual funds, has lost over 41 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Of course, the biggest oil companies, the ‚ÄúOil Majors‚Äù (such as BP, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) have enough resources, market power, and government support to survive the crisis. But the effects on the less established firms stretch beyond the energy industry itself.

Lenders. As the oil and gas firms go into crisis, the banks that extended them credit may also face defaults. Loans outstanding to the petroleum sector from regional banks in North America exceed $100 billion. Banks financing oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma saw their share prices drop nearly 30 percent. In oil-dependent states, public budgets will hurt as tax revenues decline sharply.

Retail. A number of important retailers carry net debt to EBITDA ratios that are too high to be sustainable under current conditions. For example, Rite Aid owes $15.80 for every dollar it earns. For JCPenney, the ratio is $8.30 to $1; for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is $5.80 to $1. Office Depot owes $4.60 compared to every dollar earned.

###Beyond Bailout

Bailing out distressed companies, even taking them under public ownership for a while, may staunch the bleeding. And the bubble can eventually be reinflated with enough effort. But a replay of the 2008 bailout, which involved lots of public money but very little public regulation and planning, will only mean a long slump followed by a bubble for the rich.

The American economy is a sick beast. It needs not only government handouts and ownership ‚Äî which it is getting ‚Äî it also needs planning.

Oil, airlines, and cruise ships ‚Äî these are high-emission industries that, in the face of climate crisis, must be radically transformed or cease to exist. With government ownership and planning, these industries could be unwound and their resources redeployed.

Although COVID-19 set off our current recession, it was the indulgence of the 1 percent built into the 2008 rescue that is responsible for the depth and severity of our current economic crisis. Without guidance, money was poured into the financial system. Not surprisingly, it blossomed alongside the mutually reinforcing dynamic of artificially inflated stock prices and ballooning corporate debt.

Capitulation to the gluttony of financiers is deeply unjust. But it is also unworkable in purely technical terms. Without constraints on greed, there will be another bubble and crash and a longer slump, more suffering, greater inequality, and more social instability. We have to force government to use its legal and financial power to steer the American economy toward more egalitarian, socially rational, and environmentally sustainable purposes. We have to make this bailout work for the majority of us.

#Corporate Socialism: The Government is Bailing Out Investors &amp; Managers Not You


The U.S. government is enacting measures to save the airlines, Boeing, and similarly affected corporations. While we clearly insist that these companies must be saved, there may be ethical, economic, and structural problems associated with the details of the execution. As a matter of fact, if you study the history of bailouts, there will be.



The bailouts of 2008‚Äì9 saved the banks (but mostly the bankers), thanks to the execution by then-treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who fought for bank executives against both Congress and some other members of the Obama administration. Bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking, received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later, in 2010. And, suspiciously, only a few years later, Geithner received a highly paid position in the finance industry.

That was a blatant case of corporate socialism and a reward to an industry whose managers are stopped out by the taxpayer. The asymmetry (moral hazard) and what we call optionality for the bankers can be expressed as follows: heads and the bankers win, tails and the taxpayer loses. Furthermore, this does not count the policy of quantitative easing that went to inflate asset values and increased inequality by benefiting the super rich. Remember that bailouts come with printed money, which effectively deflate the wages of the middle class in relation to asset values such as 
ultra-luxury apartments in New York City.

The Generalized Bob Rubin Trade: Keep the profits, transfer losses to taxpayers. Named after Bob Rubin who pocketed 120 million dollars from Citi but claimed uncertainty and kept past bonuses. This encourages anyone to never be insured for such eventualities since the government will pick up the tab.

####If It‚Äôs Bailed Out, It‚Äôs a Utility

First, we must not conflate airlines as a physical company with the financial structure involved. Nor should we conflate the fate of the employees of the airlines with the unemployment of our fellow citizens, which can be directly compensated rather than indirectly via leftovers of corporate subsidies. We should learn from the Geithner episode that bailing out individuals based on their needs is not the same as bailing out corporations based on our need for them.

Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained na√Øve reliance on bailouts or what‚Äôs called in the industry the ‚Äúgovernment put‚Äù.

Second, these corporations are lobbying for bailouts, which they will eventually get thanks to the pressure they can exert on the government via lobby units. But how about the small corner restaurant ? The independent tour guide ? The personal trainer? The massage professional? The barber? The hotdog vendor living from tourists near the Met Museum ? These groups cannot afford lobbyists and will be ignored.

####Buffers Not Debt

Third, as we have been warning since 2006, companies need buffers to face uncertainty ‚Äìnot debt (an inverse buffer), but buffers. Mother nature gave us two kidneys when we only need about a portion of a single one. Why? Because of contingency. We do not need to predict specific adverse events to know that a buffer is a must. Which brings us to the buyback problem. Why should we spend taxpayer money to bailout companies who spent their cash (and often even borrowed to generate that cash) to buy their own stock (so the CEO gets optionality), instead of building a rainy day buffer? Such bailouts punish those who acted conservatively and harms them in the long run, favoring the fool and the rent-seeker.

####Not a Black Swan

Furthermore, some people claim that the pandemic is a ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù, hence something unexpected so not planning for it is excusable. The book they commonly cite is The Black Swan. Had they read that book, they would have known that such a global pandemic is explicitly presented there as a white swan: something that would eventually take place with great certainty. Such acute pandemic is unavoidable, the result of the structure of the modern world; and its economic consequences would be compounded because of the increased connectivity and overoptimization. As a matter of fact, the government of Singapore, whom we advised in the past, was prepared for such an eventuality with a precise plan since as early as 2010.

For new bitcoiners &amp; pre-coiners:

Don't feel bad for not understanding bitcoin immediately, it takes a long time. 

You're not late. Everyone including myself felt late. It is still e-a-r-l-y.

HINDSIGHT IS 20/20. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. Seize the day and it's time to go all in. This asset is now de-risked and a 10000000 times better buy now than back in 2011 from a risk adjusted perspective.

I've watched this god damn internet project grow from literally being mocked 24/7 including by holders and now it's being adopted as a treasury reserve asset by Publicly listed companies. It has already won. The risk is gone.

Buy bitcoin now and front-run every public and privately listed corporation, and every nation states that wants to stay relevant in the 21st century too.

The educational material is awesome nowadays. I have been studying bitcoin 5+ hours a day for the past 2.5 years and every week I learn something new about bitcoin and how money works and realise how ignorant I was before.

First buy Bitcoin. Second invest in yourself through education. Investing in educating yourself will quell any anxiety around holding such a large % of capital in Bitcoin.

HODL does not stand for ""hold on for dear life"". That's dumb.

HODL is from a drunk misspelling from a post on the bitcoin talk forum about the price crashing and a dude's girlfriend out at a lesbian bar.

Open to answering questions.

Proposal: give customers the option to buy up to $20,000 of Coinbase stock at IPO price.

I have a strong feeling that Coinbase will be pressured by Wall Street against this idea. Please upvote if you agree with this. 

This is about an even playing field. We do not want to see the traditional IPO with bankers buying the stock at IPO price and selling it at a 50 percent or 100 premium to the general public.

We the users who have contributed to Coinbase‚Äôs success deserve this.

[deleted],0.0,3777.0,"The [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) GME retail investors vs the 0.1% situation has lead me to a place of clarity. The game is rigged, and the owners of the system will react with haste and break any laws they must to protect their cartel. For those not following the event

\- Retail investors, realised the shares of GME and some other companies were heavily shorted and in short supply, so they started buying in the hope of forcing a short squeeze (whereby the holder of the shorts will then have to buy more stock to cover their shorts, sending the price through the roof, an example is Volkswagen \[VW\] in the 2000's). This is perfectly legal.

\- the plan worked, GME went from $2 to $470 in a short space of time.

\- Melvin Capital, a Hedge fund took a massive (likely $6 billion) short position in GME and faced closure if the bet went against them, they were losing money at a fast rate and got a bail out last week by other wall street Hedge funds.

\- Melvin Capital then went on CNBC and other networks to reveal they had closed their short positions, it's highly unlikely as the options volume did not back up their claim, they were simply spreading disinformation, again this is perfectly legal

\- the retail investors at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) simply would not give up, they kept buying, the end goal could have seen the stock reach $5K based on the VW scenario.

\- the 0.1% moved to then protect the 0.1% from losing money by using the stock brokerages they own or control(Robinhood, TD, IB and all the other big players) to firstly prevent the retail investors buying more stock, you could simply not buy these stocks, you could only sell, some companies even forcibly closed down open options positons even in the absense of margin calls, so your account is in good standing with enough liquidity and they decide which stock you can have and which you can not, in this time big institutions are allowed to buy as much of this stock as they desire, just the retail traders are locked out of the casino. This is highly illegal and known as market manipulation, it also flies in the face of the idea that we have a free market.

\- people like AOC, Elon Musk, Chamath have all come out on the site of the retail traders at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) 

\- Interactive Brokers chairman and founder Thomas Peterffy goes on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell‚Äù an is literally weeping, explaining he feels hurt that his large, moneyed 0.1% friends are losing money due to the retail investors, oh the horror, how can these small investors make my friends lose money? Don't they know the implications of their actions? The horror.

The guys at [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) simply did not understand that in our world only old money gets to make real money, the little guy must be shut down and should never have a slice of the action, all he gets is inflation and a 9 to 5 job, plus side hustle if he/she's lucky. If the little guy ever finds a way to gain an advantage the loophole is quickly closed.

\- the SEC Chair then threatens to investigate the redditors on [/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) by tracking down their IP numbers with the help of reddit

I actually saved this when I read it back years ago to see one day how it would age... man talk about the worlds biggest I told you so. She had zero faith and respect in her husband. I hope he has a garage full of lambos in his giant mansion.

Here are some of the highlights  snipped for your own entertainment:

\-------

&amp;#x200B;

""My husband (I'll call him John for the sake of anonymity) and I have been married for a little over 5 years now and everything has been going well up until a year or so ago. We were planning on having children and everything. Now my life feels like it is at a complete stand still.""

Skip to 2013...

"" We are both avid redditors so when we find a new subreddit that we love we get excited and start sending each other links to see if we can get the other one interested  He finds out about bitcoin and is sending me links constantly about it.  (r/bitcoin) It goes from ""check out this cool technology"" to absolute cultish behavior in a very brief period. I would say 0-100 in probably 2 months. He starts taking every dime we have and buying them as quickly as he can. **He actually set up a feature that BUYS MORE ON A WEEKLY BASIS** after our paychecks come through. The worst part is he didn't even TELL ME he did this. He gave me this arrogant response about doing what's best for us and our future kids.

Overall, and I'm not exaggerating, I would say **we have lost over $22,000.** I kept telling him to sell as the price was rising and he promised me a big year in 2014. **The price kept falling and he CONTINUED TO BUY MORE.**  He makes more money than I do but we are building a future together and we have a shared bank account. He kept telling me this was for our kids college fund, to buy a house, etc. The money...I can get over as people spend money on other stupid crap like boats they will never use but this isn't even the beginning to the absolute craziness I will see out of him over the coming year.

My husband starts bringing up fucking bitcoin at these events. MY events for MY job. People here have a lot of money and he knows this. He saw this as some kind of opportunity. He goes on and on about how taxes are theft and bitcoin is a way out. The dollar is about to collapse, banks are destroying the world, etc. You are supposed to make light hearted jokes about how their football team is doing, not get into these political discussions. He knows this too since he's been coming to these events with me for years.

It starts off small where I laugh it off and say ""ohhhh John, he's into technology and gets a little too excited"". He saw this as condescension. The car rides home? Full on fights about how **I don't get it and I'm going to be left behind.** I felt like I was fighting with some type of evangelical Christian (I have been in plenty of these growing up). He ironically rips into religion any chance he gets but he is **absolutely part of a cult full of insane people.**

Keep in mind as this goes on he is still buying more as the **price goes down telling me we have a great opportunity on our hands**.  He ignores long term trends and focuses on these specific time frames to show me how stupid I am. Yes, my husband called me STUPID over THINKING I do not understand it.

I feel like I have read more about bitcoin than he has because he won't discuss any downsides with me. He tells me all problems will be fixed and **we are in on the ground floor**. He seems to be in a constant good news bubble about this **when no one actually cares**. Most of the responses he gets from people in public are feigned interest until they can get away from him or they just tell him they don't care if the converstaion lasts more than 2 minutes. **I am embarrassed to be around him.**

After a **recent price crash, he actually bought more using our vacation fund** that I have been saving away for AND planning. **All gone, in bitcoin never to be seen again.**

I am sorry for the long rant but this is my life now. I have tried everything. I have tried reasoning with him. I have tried explaining to him that he should not have sole control over our money. **He is so confident that he slyly brings up selling one of our cars to buy more**. He didn't come right out and say what it was for but I can guarantee you it was to buy more. He is ruining my job and **robbing me of happiness.**

I used to consider him a smart guy and **I never, ever thought he would succomb to basically being brainwashed by a bunch of clueless idiots on the internet who seem to know absolutely nothing about finance or the real world (**r/bitcoin**).** I don't know how familiar people are here with bitcoin but if you go to their subreddit, you will see exactly what I'm talking about. I started crying once reading my husband's comments worded slightly differently, repeated 100 times over. It was like I married a parrot.

What do I DO? I am not religious in any way but my family most certainly is. **I feel like I couldn't even bring up divorce and I want to save my husband.** I want him back to the way he was. It seems like he is addicted to a drug but since he doesn't realize it, everyone else is wrong. I don't know if I should have an intervention or just walk away and hope he comes to his senses when **I'm staying in a hotel for a few weeks.**

Again, I apologize for the length but I want you to feel the way I feel so you can understand the advice you are giving. I really need help here. Thank you to anyone who even reads half of this!

Man I am so glad I'm not married. You're gonna want your husband when those bitcoins are worth fortunes.... hopefully HE's gonna divorce you before that because you don't deserve any of it.

To your husband I say... keep holding those coins brother.

jsamwg,0.0,3330.0,"Hi everyone,

I've been trying to evaluate on my own whether bitcoin is worth buying and holding long term and wanted to present to you some basic findings. This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the ""HODL"" posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.

**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.

[https:\/\/institutional.fidelity.com\/app\/literature\/item\/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff083c195e1aa24ede9ce998708f1d2c0f53f83)

**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year‚Äôs near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe‚Äôs Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network‚Äôs value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.

**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe‚Äôs Law, remember?

[https:\/\/www.lookintobitcoin.com\/charts\/wallets-greater-than-1-btc\/](https://preview.redd.it/ndk2uz1t7vk61.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34386a60c29ff9950d506a7899030441a4220200)

**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the ""gold standard"" of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.

**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a ""Mt. Gox"" happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.

[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow ‚Äúcrypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers‚Äô digital asset securities https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a957eec2e5367ad36acf68cd26e6d320f9818477)

**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many ""altcoins."" But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the ""north star"" of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry‚Äôs path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the ""inefficiencies"" of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin‚Äôs processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&amp;#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&amp;#37;2Bx&amp;#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&amp;#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/t74wwd7edvk61.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86efc9bd3a7aaf40556c7d516779594edc53e884)

**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe‚Äôs Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:

*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*

If your answer is ""*yes*"" then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that ""time in the market beats timing the market,"" and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.

**The story** 

I got into bitcoin back in 2013 or so, reading about it and really going down the rabbit hole. I am a scientist, and it is my nature to go deep on things of interest. One thing I learned in my graduate studies was ‚Äúhow to learn‚Äù (how to research). For you whippersnappers ‚Äì that means more than Google and YouTube. So I learned, I read, I watched interviews, I set up a node, I mined shitcoins to understand how that worked (and traded them for bitcoin in the end.) Nobody I knew was into bitcoin, and nobody would listen to me about it. I tried to get my brother interested. I tried to get a tech friend interested. Both of them agreed it was ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù but not enough to acquire any bitcoin (this was around the time of bitcoin being just under $1k, before it dropped for several years post MtGox meltdown). So I carried on alone, with just the interwebs to console me.

In 2017 when bitcoin hit $4,000 or so, I sold 40 - enough to pay off my mortgage and cover my original costs to acquire all my holdings (avg sale price $4320). If bitcoin ate shit and died, I had a good ride, and had a paid off house to boot. I think it was a week or two later that it was $8,000. Then soon after it almost hit $20k and started dropping. I didn‚Äôt panic, but I woke up in mid-December and my brain screamed ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be greedy‚Äù to me. I listened to my brain and sold 60 BTC at around $15.6k each. Additionally, as I had my coins on Coinbase, when they opened trading for BCH in late December I dumped them within the first hour for around $3550 each. When all was said and done I had made somewhere near 1.5M USD. 


If you have questions about how much I paid in taxes, how I moved the money, if my bank gave a shit (spoiler: they did not) etc. it‚Äôs covered in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fxho4v/stop_the_bullshit_if_you_sell_your_btc_on/) with details asked in the comments. You also get to see people tell me I am wrong, so there‚Äôs that fun as well. 


I kept the rest of my BTC, and watched the price shrink down over the next couple years. I wondered if I had made a mistake by not cashing out, missed my ‚Äúbig chance for maxxx profits‚Äù or whatever, but it didn‚Äôt really matter that much because a few months after I made the initial money and paid my taxes, **I fucking retired**. Yes, as of almost 3 years ago, I retired. It wasn‚Äôt only because of the bitcoin ‚Äì I had saved money, had a 401k, and an IRA. I was on my way to a modest retirement somewhere in my 50‚Äôs or so if I wanted it, but then BOOM, I had a huge nest egg, a paid off house, other savings, and additional bitcoin for the future. Cool. kthxbye work world!


I have spent the last 3 years leisurely pursuing my own things like art and music, woodworking, collage, gardening along with sleeping in and lots of meditation and porch dwelling. There have been several small tragedies in my life since then (parents in poor health, for one) and so I have been able to tend to that more so than I could if I was working. Being retired has given me so many options and so much control over my life. I love it.


Some of you might be thinking something along the lines of - Now here we are‚Ä¶bitcoin is worth $40k so roughly speaking this guy (me) ‚Äúlost out‚Äù so far on about 2.4M after taxes. There‚Äôs also the fact that if I had kept working these last 3 years I would have additional income/savings that I could have invested so let‚Äôs round up to 3M after taxes, assuming I sold the 100 BTC now and the BCH immediately (I‚Äôm not a fan, and actually am surprised it didn‚Äôt die). How do I feel about losing out on $3M (and counting)? Honestly, not particularly bad.

Here‚Äôs the deal ‚Äì when you get to a certain point in your net worth, where you can cover your costs for your lifestyle and more (and this number is different for everyone, for me I‚Äôm really chill, so no lambo interests) the money sort of converts itself into a score like on a video game. I can look back and think ‚Äúoh man, 3 million fucking dollars more! Oh shit!‚Äù but do I lose sleep over it? No. Do I kick myself? Not really. My score is lower than it could have been‚Ä¶ but in return, I got to help a friend die peacefully, I helped another friend pivot his business, I moved to a new city and bought a cool house (still own the old one as a rental, but maybe not for much longer), and I get to wake up every day and do exactly what I want to do (minus covid issues). It‚Äôs really nice to be out of the rat race. It suits me well. I know now that I could have made more - but at the time I had no clue, and there is something to be said for the comfort of the sure thing. 


My base take is this ‚Äì we only have so much time on this planet, and I‚Äôd like to maximize my control (vs. my wealth) as much as possible. It would be hard to imagine reliving the last 3 years with a full time job, and I don‚Äôt care to dwell on what might have been. I hit my retirement number (1.5x my number + remaining BTC) and GTFO of the system. That money has grown in the funds I put it into, and I never touch principle. My remaining bitcoin became and remain gravy and I plan on hodling until it doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore.

Polytruce,0.0,3202.0,"There are a lot of newbies entering the space. There are many reasons this is great news, but I've also noticed that the quality of posts and discussion about bitcoin has plummeted. We really aren't having the important discussions with nearly the frequency that we should. 

Now I know some of you won't like me saying this, but it really does need to be said. Someone needs to be realistic with our new friends and give them the bad news and tell them the things they don't want to hear. So here goes.

I feel that we're due for a correction, and I really don't think we've even gotten started. I've been around this rodeo a few times and it always -feels- different in the moment, but in reality it's mostly cyclical. In 2017/2018 we saw a months long sell off after the run up to 20k that saw Bitcoin fall to 4k. That's more than 75% in the red from the preceeding ATH. Refer to this figure later. 

I think we're going to see a few -15%'s, maybe even a -20% or -30% before we're really back in bear territory. When it comes I expect the new crowd to go through the same things I and many others went through when we were the new kids. 

Weak hands will get shaken out. People getting way over leveraged/exposed and taking out credit to buy BTC are going to be burned hard and maybe leave the space forever. Some will risk it all and put their house on the line, and nearly all of those will lose their home. People will buy into BTC expecting their investments to double overnight, everynight.

This shit happens every time. The vets come in to tell the new guys not to panic, or not get into serious debt chasing the bull run, and we get ignored. People will tell us we're trying to short, or how we might be causing this guy to miss out on SICK GAINZ by telling him not to take a second mortgage out to buy BTC. In reality, most of us really do care about the space, and want to see it grow. It hurt me every time I read about someone blowing years of their life away trying to chase the dragon at the end of the bull run. It hurts me more now to see it happening again, and the same arguments getting thrown about as justification for being reckless with their finances. 

Refer back to that -75% figure I dropped before. Would you rather that be the value of your house? Or would you rather it be the money you saved over time to buy ‚Çø responsibly? I made my own mistakes too, thankfully not with my house or something else vital to me, but mistakes nonetheless that put me in severe debt when I tried to chase BTC back in 2013. I only just now climbed out of that hole. (I literally made the last payment before posting this)

Bottom line is that BTC unfortunately attracts the get rich quick types, and when shit hits the fan they are NOT happy. They will panic sell to stop the bleeding. If you gamble your life savings on Bitcoin while it's at ATH because of FOMO, it's going to really hurt. 

The harsh truth of it is, if bitcoin is going gangbusters and you don't already own your position, you're too late for the bull run. Your best bet is to accumulate over time, so that in four years when we're looking at this situation again you can be the guy making five figures in his sleep, and making posts like these telling the new guys to have a longer term view.

I dunno, I just don't want to see people FOMO themselves into crippling debt like I did, and have heard so many horror stories about. It's the beginning of a very wild ride over the next couple of months.

EDIT: With this getting a lot more attention than I thought it would, I'd like to just say thank you to everyone for even giving this the time of day. I was initially replying to another comment on a different thread and the whole thing got a little long winded, leading me to just post this here instead. 

I just wanted to clarify a few things that I feel got left out or that I missed the mark on:

1. I am very bullish. I do not believe we're crashing imminently, but rather wanted to caution those getting sweaty palms of what could happen should they get too emotional and overextend while we're in uncharted territory. 

2. I don't think we're going to follow a picture prefect pattern of the previous bull runs. The price is entirely unpredictable, and if one could tell you with any certainty what the price or market sentiment would be at any given time they would have to be a time traveler. 

3. It is never too late to get into BTC. But you should temper your expectations when you're a late entry to the cycle. The 10x gains come later when you've held through a full cycle.",Bitcoin,Some honesty from a longtime hodler and Bitcoin fanboy.,3202.0,0.92

The exchanges here in my country, they base the Bitcoin price in US$ dollar, they just convert it to R$ Real. At that time, 1 BTC = R$ 29.350, now days 1 BTC = R$ 55.500. This means that my original R$ 1.000 is now almost at R$ 1.900! That‚Äôs because Brazil is in a really bad political and economic situation and the price of dollar is all times high, making R$ Real devalued.

That‚Äôs when it hit me. Now I understand why people on nations that is f\*cking their money up buys BTC, it saves it from inflation! Recently the Halving happen and it hit me again, Bitcoin is a deflationary money! Every day it becomes a scarce resource, but the demand is the same, making the price go up! **Bitcoin is not the future, it‚Äôs the present!

My best guess is the Bitcoin Time Traveler is responsible for putting that symbol in the minds and hearts of all children of the 80s/90s so that they would be predisposed to becoming Bitcoin holders and ultimately adopting the symbol to denote Sats

You can look at my post history - I sold in 2017, on Coinbase, and moved 100% of the money (1.6M after I dumped my BCH) into my Bank of America account.

1. My account was not frozen
2. My account was not closed
3. Nothing happened except they wanted me to open a brokerage account with them
4. I asked before I moved the money what to expect. They said ""did you get the money illegally? Because that's all we care about.""

So any of these gloom-and-doom edgelord crypton00bs who think the FBI is crawling around looking for people who make 10k on bitcoin and try to cashout are just full of it. 

Don't want trouble? Pay your taxes and ride off into the sunset. Want to get ripped off by shady mofos? Sneak around and try to use some sketch-ass exchange for $200 at a time over several months and hope they don't freeze your account for ""reasons"". 

Hope this helps. Normally I just stay quiet, but the misinformation on this was so huge and stupid, I had to chime in.

Lastly - if you don't believe me READ MY POST HISTORY - you will see the consistency of my message. So either I'm telling the truth, or I'm repeating the same lie (for what? internet points?) consistently for the last 2 years - you decide. 

HODL what you can, but use your gainz to lock in the life you want! I sure did.

*Edit: Lots of peeps are missing the point here. It's not about Coinbase. It's about moving your money after you cash out. I've seen so many uninformed peeps saying ""your bank won't let you do X"" or ""no bank will allow Y"" and I'm telling you that's just not true. One thing tho - if you do shady shit (gambling, bad KYC, whatever) and Coinbase sees that, you will have a bad time. Just like if you lied to your bank.

\---

Every number between 0 cents and the current ATH has been, by definition, the all-time-high at one point. Don't let that prevent you from taking a risk in something you believe in. Extend your time horizon to a decade and lock your coins away.

\---

I've been a libertarian since I was a teenager. The expanding role of the State is something that I've been worrying about for most of my life. While learning about the immorality of the existence of the State, at some point I learned about monetary policy and how inflation is robbing everyone on an unprecedented scale. I tucked this knowledge away and was determined to figure out a way around it when I started making my own money. (This paragraph is the only one involving political philosophy, go ahead and continue reading)

I first heard of Bitcoin in 2010 on one of the many forums I frequented in my libertarian internet circle. It was an interesting concept to me, but I didn't pursue it at all. Again I tucked this knowledge away for future use.

I heard of it again several months later (2010). This time I decided to try it out. I remember downloading and syncing the reference wallet and using a BTC faucet to send coins to my wallet. I forget exactly how many it was... 5, maybe? That's as far as I went with it though. At some point I deleted the wallet and the downloaded blockchain - probably to make room for a Steam game or something. Those coins are gone.

That's right - Steam. I have been a gamer for most of my life as well. I owned a powerful graphics card at the time: The Radeon 5970.

The third time I heard about Bitcoin was in May 2011. I had heard that the price was lifting off and people were making a lot of money from it. This time I decided to dive in and see what I could figure out.

This was where I fell into the deep rabbit hole of Bitcoin. I remember getting so absorbed in it that I didn't sleep some nights. I was working my day job, going home and learning all that I could about Bitcoin. Learning about how addresses were generated, how wallets worked, how mining worked, how the difficulty adjustment worked, everything that I possibly could.

After a week or two of obsessing and reading about Bitcoin, I decided that this was the most important invention since the internet - the most perfect form of money ever created. One of the most ingenious systems ever designed by man - and NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT YET.

I can't recall if any other coins existed at the time, but between 2011-2012 I remember other coins like Namecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, and some others. I don't hear about any of those other coins these days... besides LTC and XRP, of course.

I decided that I wanted in. I needed to get some Bitcoin. I needed it NOW!! This would be like buying stock in the Internet itself but better - no counterparty risk, and I could be my own bank!

I wasn't making a lot of money at the time, so putting money towards anything discretionary wasn't going to be friendly to my budget. Yes, I owned a badass gaming rig, but that was my only luxury in life. I knew I was going to buy for the long term, so I decided to put aside $500 and go for it. I was going to buy Bitcoin.

At the time, Mt Gox was the only game in town that I can remember. I don't think BTC-e existed yet, or maybe I just hadn't heard of it.

I signed up for a Gox account and figured out how to fund it. There were a few ways to do this, one of which was another app called Dwolla. So I signed up for Dwolla and got verified. I then deposited my $500 and initiated the ACH transfer to Gox. BTC price at the time: $3.

I had initiated the transfer on a Tuesday evening after work. I was informed that the transfer would arrive at Gox on Friday.

I watched agonizingly as the price climbed hour after hour, day after day. $3.50. $4. $5. $6. I was missing the boat!!! By Thursday evening the price had doubled.

At work on Friday, I checked my email on my phone practically every five minutes. The transfer didn't go through the entire work day. I had plans with friends that evening - damn it, I was going to have to try and do this on my phone while hanging with my friends?!

I ended up making my first BTC purchase while sitting in a movie theater. I bought 50 Bitcoin for $10 each - during an all-time-high.

I still hodl every one of these coins today.

(The movie, for the curious: X-Men: First Class)

I couldn't stop there, though. The more I learned, the more I had to know. The more I had to DO. That's when I got into GPU mining.

This was a time before ASICs. I believe GPU mining was relatively new -- before this, miners were only using CPUs (which were in 2011 -- like GPUs in 2020 -- obsolete for SHA256 mining).

The next day I dove headfirst into Bitcoin mining. I downloaded the software and set up an account on Slush Pool. I ran my 5970 on full blast for a while and went out with some friends. When I got back, my bedroom was noticeably hotter than it was when I left. So that's what I was going to be dealing with? Ok, fine.

I also couldn't play any demanding video games while the miner was running. I'd have to dial the hashrate down, or disable it completely. Ok, I guess I can manage that.

After a few days of dealing with that, I decided to buy another 5970. If I got bored of Bitcoin, it would still make The Witcher 2 run better!

All told, between mining with Slush Pool and BTCGuild for a month, I managed to mine an additional 50BTC that month.

I still hodl every one of these coins today.

One day, my electric bill came. $350. For my 1BR apartment? That can't be right...

I called up the electric company and told them they double-billed me.

""Nope, that amount is accurate. That's what you owe for this month. Have a nice day!""

And that was the day I stopped Bitcoin mining.

I had been telling all my friends and gamer friends about Bitcoin the entire time. They laughed at me. I told them they wouldn't be laughing when I was a millionaire.

Soon after, Bitcoin crashed -- HARD. Dropping from $32 at its peak to $2 over the next few months -- one of the largest price drops in its history.

I was dejected. I stopped talking about it with my friends. The gamer communities I was a member of made fun of me relentlessly, trashing Bitcoin every day. News articles celebrating Bitcoin's death popped up everywhere. It was the first major public crash, and I felt all alone.

I uninstalled the Bitcoin price widget from my phone. I moved on with my life and tried to forget about Bitcoin. I left the wallet on my PC, but deleted my copy of the blockchain.

I barely thought about Bitcoin for the next two years. Any time someone brought it up at work or in my friend group, I changed the subject. I was completely demoralized and thought I had fallen for the biggest scam of all time.

After this unbearable TWO YEAR period... Bitcoin came back.

One day I opened r/Bitcoin and saw utter elation all over the front page. What the hell was going on?

Bitcoin had surpassed the last all-time-high and was climbing still. $50... $100. And it was still going!!!

I snapped out of my multi-year funk right then and there. Somehow my paper financial loss had clouded my judgment and made me forget about the fundamentals that made me interested in Bitcoin in the first place.

""Bitcoin was back?"" It had never left. It was still the same decentralized, unforgeable, instantly transferrable miracle asset that I had fallen in love with.

I got back into mining again, but I didn't leave my GPUs running 24/7 like I had before. Eventually, ASICs started coming out and obsoleted GPU miners, so I had to start mining LTC instead and selling them for BTC. I mined on a site called give-me-ltc and did my trades on BTC-e.

Eventually I got tired of managing my miners, paying extra for electricity, and dealing with switching stuff around for gaming. I stopped mining again and moved on to other things.

I exited this phase with an additional 30BTC and over 400LTC. I still hodl every one of these coins today.

Eventually, BTC hit $1000. I watched this live on [bitcoinity.org](https://bitcoinity.org). I remember this day vividly.

The graphic shown on bitcoinity for every price point was usually some sort of funny gif - someone dancing, someone acting crazy, someone making a funny face, Mr. Bean watching signposts fly past his car. This time, the gif was different - it was serious.

It was an astronaut on the moon. A flag was planted behind him bearing the Bitcoin logo.

Tears welled up in my eyes. This was significant. Bitcoin was being recognized for what it was - the most perfect form of money ever created.

My stack was now worth enough to pay off all of my six-figure student loan debt. I had thought that I would be paying this debt off for the rest of my life. Bitcoin meant potential financial freedom to me.

I didn't sell a single satoshi.

Of course, $1000 didn't last, and paying off all my loans with my stack was no longer a possibility. The price did not recover for almost FOUR years -- even longer than the previous crypto winter. During this time I bought a few more coins through Coinbase.

The 2017 run-up was a blur -- except for one day...

The day I became a crypto millionaire.

My family didn't grow up with a ton of money. I never had the latest clothes, toys -- well, anything. We weren't poor, but we scraped by. I didn't have a great education in personal finance.

Being a crypto millionaire went straight to my head.

Driving to work on that day, I remember thinking I was the most badass person on Earth. Somehow I had managed to manipulate some computer numbers around that were now worth over a million dollars!!

I couldn't help it - I told everyone at work. I was a crypto millionaire. I couldn't shut up about it. I told my family. I told my friends. I told everyone.

I went to the store to grab a few things. Walking the aisles, I couldn't stop thinking about it. ""These people have no idea they're standing next to a MILLIONAIRE.""

Of course, my crypto millionaire status didn't last long.

This time, though, I SODL a few coins at the peak. I bought a house and a car.

A month or two later, I was no longer a crypto millionaire.

Seeing the altcoin season was kind of crazy to me. For a few months, you literally could not pick a losing coin. Everyone was a winner. It was sheer insanity. I picked up a few ETH to get some exposure, even though I didn't (and still don't) believe in it long term.

I'm doing pretty well these days. I am numb to any price activity at this point. The last time I bought was the dip down to $4000 in March. I don't know how anyone could have resisted that one.

Other than what I SODL in 2017, I still hodl all of my coins.

You may be able to see a pattern here. There's always going to be another all-time-high. There's always going to be a crash or a correction. You're probably going to feel stupid more than a handful of times being a HODLer. But eventually these feelings go away.

I have a few more anecdotes and random thoughts to share, so I'll make them bullet points below:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I held on to my BCH for a while. I will admit that I was TERRIFIED during the flippening. 6-12 months later, I sold them all for BTC.

\- I immediately sold all my BSV for LTC.

\- I hold BTC, LTC, and ETH. That's it.

\- I don't believe in any of these centralized or ""new and improved"" shitcoins. I'm a BTC maximalist through-and-through. The only other coin I'd consider at this point would be Monero. I know almost nothing about it and I haven't done any research on it, so I don't hold any.

&amp;#x200B;

FUNNY

\- I gave $5 of BTC to a friend in 2013. They forgot about it. I reminded them about it this year. They sold it for $175.

\- I gave $30 of BTC to a friend in 2013. They sold it in 2017 for $750.

\- I solo mined IxCoin (literal who?) for a few days because I wanted to feel what it was like to solo mine a block. I did not solo mine a block.

\- My favorite Bitcoin meme is ""This is gentlemen."" Why don't people say that anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

REMINISCING

\- Wallets I used: Bitcoin core -&gt; Armory Offline (airgapped with TAILS) -&gt; Electrum Offline (airgapped with TAILS) -&gt; trezor

\- Armory was flaky as fuck. I moved on to Electrum after the 20th time Armory failed to sync the blockchain. I remember having to manually export the private keys using some Python script because I couldn't get the wallet synced.

\- Reddit is too slow for BTC sometimes, so I would go to the BTC-e trollbox to get some realtime action. Now that BTC-e is gone, I typically hang out in /biz/ when Reddit is boring.

&amp;#x200B;

REGRETS

\- Not buying more. Not mining more.

\- Not selling BCH for BTC immediately. That one still stings.

\- Focusing a little too much on paying down debt vs buying more BTC.

\- Buying precious metals in 2013. What a waste.

\- Selling in 2017. But, I wanted a house and a car. Regretting taking profit is stupid, but I can't help it.

&amp;#x200B;

THOUGHTS

\- I never once tried to convince anyone to buy Bitcoin, despite how much I talked about it. I tried to convince people of the potential and that the Fed was evil, but I never once said, ""You should buy Bitcoin"" to anyone.

\- I see another 10x for BTC. Just buy BTC. Don't buy anything else. Just buy BTC and fucking HODL.

\- HODL through these crashes. They make you stronger. After a few of them, nothing will faze you. Be a fucking man and HODL on to your coins!!!!!

\- People just don't understand the network effect of the BTC protocol. No one cares that another coin has better features. No one cares that there are better internet protocols. They use what has the most infrastructure and support. Don't fall for these shitcoins.

\- People don't understand the layering concept. Increasing blocksize simply isn't the solution to scaling Bitcoin - second layer and beyond is the solution.

\- Taxation is theft.

Hopefully this was at least mildly entertaining.

Happy New Year!!!!!

I just wanted to take some time to show appreciation for andreas antonopolous. The average person will never know about him, and the mainstream media will never mention his name. But he has played such a big role in making so many people understand what bitcoin really is. In my humble opinion, we wouldn't be where we are today without him. 

A smart, humble, patient individual with a rare ability to deconstruct and make sense of the most complex of subjects. A true visionary who doesnt care about the financial gains that may come along with bitcoin, but about the potential for this technology to better people's lives.

If it wasn't for him, I would have dismissed bitcoin as hype couple years ago. He was the only one who made things click. Thanks to him I saw the light.

So thank you Andreas for all your hard work and passion.

&gt; A male, Anglo-accent caller asked if I was &lt;my full name&gt; and claimed to be a drug addict, and gave me my full address, and said he knows I have a lot of bitcoins. When asked how, he said my information has been leaked on the dark web. I played dumb and he eventually says I purchased a ledger hardware wallet and ‚Äúonly loaded c*nts‚Äù buy them.

&gt; He told me a sob story about how he is addicted to meth, is about to run out, and needs monero to buy more. He demanded 10 XMR and said if it‚Äôs not sent by midnight, he will show up at my house, kidnap me, and ‚Äústab to death‚Äù any relatives living at my address. I was able to record this phone call as I put him on speaker phone.

&gt; I have went to the police and filed a police report. They are going to try and trace the caller and has sent a police car to wait outside which I am very grateful for. All of my doors etc are locked and I have the officer‚Äôs phone on speed dial.

&gt; I just want to warn everyone about the dangers of Ledger‚Äôs recklessness. If there is a class action lawsuit I will gladly join and submit this as evidence.

Thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwalletleak/comments/ki1nsz/received_phone_call_threatening_kidnapping_and/

It looks like the warnings about data and privacy around having hardware wallets sent to your home have come true. Bitcoin is unlike most other assets and is open to theft and threats like this. [This isn't the first nor the last time](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks). Privacy isn't ""just for criminals"". Saying ""if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear"" is bullshit.

The problem is, not only have we been right about this for the last decade, it's the ""spot on, how the fuck did you know that would happen?"" kind of right. I myself have gone on national TV a couple of times here in my home country saying Bitcoin is a hedge for the shit show that is going on in the world and that it's market cap will go to 1 trillion ** way back in 2016.** How embarrasing would it have been if we were wrong?

It's not that we know we are right, but it's because we are not afraid to be wrong, even if a lot of us has put more skin in the game than required. Starting Bitcoin businesses, publicly supporting and talking about Bitcoin in the face of ridicule (talking about Bitcoin in a startup conference or fintech conference in 2014 will get you a few odd looks and dismissive laughs.), and putting what some might consider an irresponsible percentage of our net worth in the asset because we truly believe in its potential.

So to those saying ""Who's gonna buy your Bitcoin at $100K?"" I say this: First, I am not selling at $100K, lol. Second, talk to me in 4 or 5 years, feel free to make fun of me if I am wrong *this time*. The funny thing is, back then when Bitcoin was small, our conviction was already big. What makes you think that will change today?

The Bitcoin network will outlast all of us, this I am sure of. Whether you believe in its potential of you think it's one big ponzi scheme, when you take your last breath on your deathbed in 30, 40, or 50 years, the Bitcoin network will still be chugging along, making new blocks to add to the chain, as long as the telecommunications and internet networks exist and free people all over the world desire a monetary system that is free from politics and human intervention.

[In the words of Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://medium.com/opacity/bitcoin-1537e616a074): *""Bitcoin will go through hick-ups (hiccups). It may fail; but then it will be easily reinvented as we now know how it works. In its present state, it may not be convenient for transactions, not good enough to buy your decaffeinated expresso macchiato at your local virtue-signaling coffee chain. It may be too volatile to be a currency, for now. But it is the first organic currency.*

*But its mere existence is an insurance policy that will remind governments that the last object establishment could control, namely, the currency, is no longer their monopoly. This gives us, the crowd, an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.""*",Bitcoin,"People ask ""Who's gonna buy your BTC at $100K?""

Rikky999,0.0,1571.0,"Im a 19yr old and after many years of being a stoner I‚Äôve always thought back on how much money I‚Äôve wasted on something ill never get back. Some might say you can‚Äôt put a price on memories but the truth is for me that I don‚Äôt remember 80% of the shit I‚Äôve done while high. 

At the beginning of this pandemic I was a little happy I now had an excuse to just stay at home and smoke my weed but I quickly started to see things differently. I was now wasting away my days and gaining absolutely nothing. 

So around New Years I decided I wanted to take a break and just breath and see if I could do more or even be just as happy without weed. After just a few weeks I understood that all it did was make my mind foggy and take away my time. Recently I became very intrigued by crypto currencies and it boggled my mind how bulletproof Bitcoin seemed to me. I do believe it can be a major asset in the future and if not Bitcoin it self it‚Äôll at least pave the way for the others. 

So I‚Äôve decided I will now take all the money I save from not smoking anymore and put it into Bitcoin mostly and other cryptos and stocks. I will do so by DCA and I‚Äôm so excited to see where this goes. I hope this post can maybe point other young adults in the same direction and to be smarter with your money.

EDIT: Thank you guys for all the meaningful words and support, y‚Äôall got me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside lol

EDIT 2:
I see a lot of you guys saying why don‚Äôt I just grow my own MJ and then take the profits to buy Bitcoin or stocks afterwards. I could do this as I do live in a country where it‚Äôs legal. But I guess I didn‚Äôt make it very clear that PERSONALLY I‚Äôve always had my doubts of being a daily user and I‚Äôve taken breaks or tried quitting before but I always came back to it. Even trying to smoke in moderation always brought me back to using daily. To my luck I was able to throw dabs away and just stick to flower as I found that to be much better more my health and mentality. However the main goal of this post was to show people how the real reason I‚Äôve been able to go full on cold turkey is by simply replacing a bad habit with a good one. Investing. This wasn‚Äôt to persuade everyone but simply help push those who were on the edge like I was.

TryBobby,0.0,1494.0,"The point of his post is to show that, despite the high price of bitcoin, you can invest without buying a full bitcoin.

Much like a dollar is divided into 100 cents, one bitcoin is divided into 100 million Satoshis. That means you can technically buy 0.00000001 bitcoin if you wanted to. **The value of one satoshi at the time of posting is $0.00048878**. Still sounds cheap to me.

Finally, as a closing remark, a reminder to please not buy bitcoin on Robinhood, Paypal, or eToro. They do not allow you to keep your bitcoin, by moving it off their platform. Buy from an exchange where fees are lowest, and then move it to a non-custodial wallet, where you get a seed phrase and private key. 

My personal favourite is Exodus.

Nossa30,0.0,1428.0,"# It all started,

In late 2015 when I first started mining Bitcoin when I first downloaded Miner gate. After installing it and still couldn't figure out how to move it to my own wallet, I just gave up for about a year or so. It was still too complex at the time to use. I only mined about $100 bucks or so. 

2017 rolls around, BTC starts going crazy. I started investing JUST before the $20K ATH. As 2018 starts, it pretty much went downhill from there. However I never gave up because I knew Bitcoin was something special and unlike any other asset. 

All throughout 2018 I did all the wrong things you should never do as an investor. I bought at the ATH, I caught a falling knife and bought bitcoin literally as I watched it go from $20K, $15K,$10K, and down to the months long slog at $3,000. I even tried trading and buying Altcoins and lost even more money. When BTC was stuck down there, thats when I was buying the most. Even when nobody was making youtube videos anymore and nothing but FUD left and right, I was still buying. Mostly because I heard a bunch of youtubers say ""buy when there is blood in the streets"" so that's exactly what I did. Keep in mind I had never invested in a stock my entire life at this point. 

# The Key method of how I got 1 BTC

Dollar cost Averaging

That is the key. Every single week I got paid it was only about $500 a week. Since I lived with my mom and only paid half rent, every two weeks I got paid I would buy exactly 0.01 BTC (put another way, I bought 1% of a bitcoin every 2 weeks). Regardless of the price I would invest. 

Since 2018 was a bear market, It was getting cheaper and cheaper every single week. When it was $3000, It was so cheap that 0.01 BTC was like $30 or $40 a piece so I bought like 3 or 4%(0.03 BTC) every 2 weeks. Since there is 52 weeks in a year, by the time 2019 rolled around, I already had roughly 65% of a Bitcoin. 2019 was half bear and half bull market but still I stuck to my guns and no matter what every paycheck I bought 0.01 BTC regardless of price. 

Now by the time 2020 rolled around I had exactly 97% of a BTC. It was only this year That I had finally gotten to 1 BTC! I heard Charlie lee say a long time ago to stay away from Altcoins until you have 1 BTC and that is exactly what I did. After the pandemic started, I then started buying Ethereum 0.2 ETH a paycheck and I now have multiple ETH. 

I just wanted to tell my story of how I got 1 BTC and hopefully inspire others to get invested. I don't know if what I did was luck or skill, ***but the key thing is to stay consistent***. If you water a plant every single day eventually you will get the fruit.",Bitcoin,How I bought 1 BTC making $15 an hour after 2 years!,1428.0,0.95

Also, this is an insult to Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not need your help with some kind of artificially induced pump or scheme. Bitcoin is not a meme stock to toy with. Bitcoin is the future of money. Bitcoin actually has fundamentals and networking to support its price growth. In 5 years, Bitcoin will probably still be holding this level or higher and going up. We don't need investors hearing that bitcoin is a game and has to be manipulated in order to go up.

Lambull,0.0,1403.0,"That's right. I bought Bitcoin before it even existed. All these posts on here about people buying bitcoin so early, I figured I better share my heart warming, humble story of success.

I've always been sort of an economics expert. I watched the movie 'The Big Short', and understood literally everything they talked about. Our banking system is really easy for me to comprehend, even though for most people, it can be quite confusing. If you have questions, feel free to ask me.

I anticipated Bitcoin being invented, so I paid people 3 years ahead of time for their future holdings, at a guarantied fixed price. I actually used an Ethereum smart contract back in 2005, to lock in these business contracts. I'm so ahead of the game. This might come off as a little arrogant, but I have to face the truth - I'm probably the smartest person out of everyone I know. I figured I needed to post it on the subreddit so you all have a chance to meet and get to know me, and you can be inspired to try and be me. I have so much wisdom to share, because I make such incredible financial decisions. I guess you could say I'm a bit of a financial guru. I'm always giving my friends and family free financial tips, even if they don't ask for it, because I want them to succeed too.

In dollar terms, I‚Äôm almost a bitcoin bazillionaire. It feels good, but not because I can brag about the accumulated wealth, it‚Äôs more that the people who I told to invest whatever money they could afford to lose, back in early 2005, all told me I was an idiot. Those same people have now been humbled.

I have too many tips to share from my experience. I'll save those for another post.

Anon-Dude-Bitcoin,0.0,1211.0,"Anonymous account for obvious reasons but I wanted to share my story.

Edit: I was making 18k per year while working construction in 2012 because I had trouble finding work in my field of study. I worked hard, made a career change, and my first ""real"" salary was 52k per year.

I started buying Bitcoin in June of 2017. I continued to buy small amounts as the price increased. I was convinced I would ""never"" be able to afford an entire Bitcoin but I kept at it. I was only making about $59k per year at the time ($10,000 below the median income for my area) and still trying to pay off what had started off as over $100,000 in student loan debt. 

Like many others, I was discouraged by some of my purchasing decisions (like buying at 17k), but I kept buying until I had my first whole Bitcoin around October of 2018. Even then, I was only down about 35% because I had made purchases starting in June of 2017. Then, shit hit the fan in November of 2018 and I watched as I was suddenly down more than 65%. My bags were heavy and I truly understood this was the despair stage. However, I didn't give up and I actually bought another full Bitcoin at $4,100 in April of 2018 despite feeling like my anus had been stretched to the max.   


I didn't really buy any more Bitcoin after that for a long while. I felt that I had reached the ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"" limit and I was a member of the 10 million club with my 2.1 BTC. I paid off debt, lived life, fixed up my house, etc. I thought I was done buying Bitcoin. I finally ""broke even"" around the $7,700 price mark.   


Fast forward to March of 2020 when we crashed because of Covid, I was kicking myself because I didn't really have money at the time to buy more. I only had a couple thousand in an emergency fund and I don't touch that unless there is a true emergency.   


Then a perfect storm happened. I got a new job close by that was paying significantly more money and I needed to sell my house. A house that I had built up a lot of equity in over a short period of time. I went from only having a $2,000 emergency fund (plus 2.1 Bitcoin that was worth about $22,000 at the time) and a standard 401k from my previous employer worth about 55k, to about $65,000 in cash from the sale of my house and $55k in a 401k that I could now put into an IRA.   


I put 10% down on the purchase of a new home, bought some stuff, and I had $30,000 in cash once the dust settled. At first, I thought that money would simply be my 3-6 month emergency fund and it would sit in cash in my checking account, earning 0.0007% interest. That's the responsible thing to do, right? Around this same time, I rolled my 401k from my previous employer into an IRA in part because they wouldn't let me buy GBTC. I found an IRA provider who allowed me to buy GBTC and I sent the money over. It took me 7 years to build up a 401k worth $55,000. (I think I averaged about 13% annual returns).    


Between the cash and the new IRA, I had over $85,000 just sitting on the sidelines, waiting to pull the trigger. This was more money than I had ever had before. BTC sat around $9,000 for several weeks and I was convinced we would retrace back down to 7 or 8k before the next bull cycle. I hesitated out of fear, because of all the FUD surrounding Covid.   


Then I saw the news about Microstrategy, then the price pumped to over 11k (Fuck! I can't buy 3 whole Bitcoin anymore with my 30k). I knew I was FOMOing in, but I figured it wouldn't matter much in 10 years if I bought at 9.5k or 10k or 11k. I think seeing institutional investors was the thing that pushed my hand to go ""all-in"". That, and I still have a good 30 years of work ahead of me so if I go bust, then at least I can start again. I bought $30,000 worth of Bitcoin at $11,100 and I bought about $55k worth of GBTC when BTC was around $11,300.   


Now, I've more than doubled my net worth in a matter of months and it feels fucking great. Altogether, I've put about $100,000 into Bitcoin which is now worth more than $260,000. I'm hopeful for the future and I think 2021 is going to be a great year for Bitcoin. I don't plan on selling my Bitcoin for anything other than paying off my mortgage. I've already decided that whenever my $30,000 BTC buy becomes enough to pay capital gains taxes and my mortgage, I will sell. I'm making the decision now so that I won't have to later. I will always HODL at least 2.1 BTC to give to my kid or a charity if my kid turns out to be a little shit.  I'll start to sell some of my GBTC in 20 years when I'm getting ready to retire. I hope they launch a Bitcoin ETF before then so that I don't have to pay 2% every year. I've already been through a full bull/bear cycle so I feel I am better prepared for when it happens next. I've only sold once before early on, and I regretted it so now I have diamond hands.   


Onward and upward.

Edit: For all of the folks who are saying I shouldn't pay off my mortgage, I understand what you're saying. I could make considerably more money if I just HODL for 30 years. I could also lose it all because even though I'm a believer, Bitcoin isn't a sure thing. A paid for house is. It's also a great way to give myself a 25% pay raise which would give me far more cash flow to invest in businesses or give to others in need or improve the quality of life for me and my family or even to buy more Bitcoin. I have very personal reasons for wanting to pay off my mortgage. It's a goal I've had years before I ever heard of Bitcoin. 2.1 Bitcoin + my Greyscale funds will be enough to live comfortably well into the future.

Imagine paying $70 for a shitty little hardware wallet, but to these greedy fucks, that's not enough. They HAVE to have your identifying personal information FOREVER, including your name and physical home address, just to squeeze out a few more Euros of bottom line per customer by marketing or probably outright selling the data.

I am trying to establish a multi-sig regime between my friends and family, so if one fucks up, he or she has a safety-net with at least one other person they trust.

But it's not easy. And what definitely doesn't help, is this shit by Ledger.

Ledger could have used the user data they had and are now used by scammer to attack their customers, to warn their users. They didn't.

Ledger knows, that almost all of their users, most certainly the most vulnerable to attacks, are using their inhouse software Ledger Live.

How many lives were financially devastated, because Ledger Inc. didn't find it necessary, to send out ONE FUCKING E-MAIL at the day of the breach saying something like this:

&gt; Attention: There was a data breach with the Ledger user database. From now on forward, all communication between Ledger Inc. and its customers will be done through Ledger Live. You can verify the authenticity of all our messages using Ledger Live in this way: &lt;showing how to verify a digital signature with Ledger Live.&gt;

Not any more.** I want to be the dad who has always **time**, at least for the next ten years, while my kids will still be children.

# Time is important, and Bitcoin bought me time. Time to live freely and fully, without the daily stress of earning for the next ten years.

**Bitcoin is a miracle. For some, it creates Lambos and Teslas, for some it means yachts and airplanes. To me, it is a time machine.** Nothing ever in my life gave me back my time, nothing until Bitcoin came along.

A wonderful thing is happening around us, Bitcoin is turning the traditional wealth distribution of the world upside down. It is democratic, it is unconfiscatable, and it is there for everyone.

I will hold to the rest of my sats until at least the next 10 years. Hope they will provide me with some further relaxing time.

I think it's just mind blowing to know that this is a transaction that:

* only requires 2 participants: a sender and a receiver. There are no middleman involved.

* is impossible to censor. Nobody can stop this transaction from happening.

* does not require anybody's permission.

* requires no identity on both ends. Actually, it doesn't not even require a human being. 

* is unalterably written into history and this is even more so as time passes and hashes get stacked on top of them.

* can cross borders just as easy as it can cross the internet. As a matter a fact, this transaction might just

freemarketdaddy,0.0,1069.0,"Let me first start out by thanking this subreddit, as it truly has changed my life. The information sharing and passion found in this community is something that is awe inspiring. 

Just a little background - I graduated with an applied economics degree and have been working in finance for over 10 years. I first heard about Bitcoin from a friend during the 2017 run up to the previous ATH and told him he was a fool to invest in it. I advised him to go read up about tulip mania and get back to me. I also felt pretty vindicated when it eventually ‚Äúcrashed‚Äù in 2018. The problem I had was that I only looked at Bitcoin and cryptos in general, from a very surface level perspective. I also was worried about no central authority, network security, and no regulations. Fast forward to 2020 and I‚Äôm now literally begging my friends and family to buy some before it‚Äôs too late. 

What changed? My fears about the global economy has been growing rapidly the last few years. We are at a time when an estimated 17 trillion dollars worth of debt is producing a negative yield (I don‚Äôt want to get too technical  here, but trust me this is insane). Meanwhile we have 28 trillion dollars in US debt alone - with that number growing rapidly ever year. We are getting to a point in which every dollar the government receives in a year will go to paying interest on that debt. The federal reserve can‚Äôt raise interest rates, basically ever at this point, because they will bankrupt the government with higher interest rates on those debt payments. So the only way for the fed to pay our debt is to print more money to meet those obligations. We are truly at a moment of no return (please don‚Äôt listen to the MMT crowd, as they are a bunch of ass hats). The dollar being used as the global reserve currency is where this massive problem comes into play. 

What does this have to do with Bitcoin? Since inflation is inevitable, where do you put your money to preserve it‚Äôs value? Of course there is gold, and that was my first thought. But then sometime in June I ran across an article about Bitcoin, that led me to this subreddit and then down a rabbit hole that I will never escape. Bitcoin is superior to gold in every way, so it truly is the most logical choice. But in economic terms Bitcoin is a pristine piece of collateral that honestly will become the new global base collateral for all of finance. In the financial world Bitcoin solves a ton of problems: everyone can audit it, it is immutable, no double spend of collateral (trust me this happens all the time with government bonds today), the entire system is deflationary, it has a fixed total amount, and a massive amount of value can be sent across the globe in minutes (try taking self custody of gold and sending 100 million dollars of it anywhere). 

Let me stop here because I could go on and on...but can hear my wife in my head right now saying just stop there and let them digest this post. If for some reason this post is worthy of your attention, then I would love to do a second one about how I see this space growing from an economic standpoint. 

You all are amazing and I really do hope my first post on Reddit is of value. I promised I wasn‚Äôt going to say it...To the Moon ladies and gents!!!!

Edit: I am definitely shocked and humbled at the response this generated. I promise to look over the comments and will address some of the more relevant topics. I will also work on the second post with a link back to this one.

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee scaling** - Fees are chosen by the sender - you can choose your own fee. An appropriate fee for an on-chain transaction depends on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction.  Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view fee estimates [here](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and mempool activity [here](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w).  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), a second layer scaling solution currently rolling out on the Bitcoin mainnet.  
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the lightning network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or [by memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

* [Cash app](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin)

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.  Alternatively there are many software wallet options to choose from [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) depending on your use case.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""** meaning if you don't store your coins in a wallet that you control the keys to then you do not really own your bitcoin as you have to ask permission from the third party in order to move them.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.  

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins (shitcoins) are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://getumbrel.com/).  You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Earning bitcoin

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoin by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in recent Electrum wallet releases
bit | bit | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin (ŒºBTC)
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10000 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100k sats

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Looking as bitcoin neared toward $50k mark earlier today I was increasingly motivated to find my old stash of bitcoins back from 2012 when few people had even heard this was a thing. I recall it was the time where Mt Gox was the only real exchange around and we crowded on IRC channels as well as bitcointalk.org. In 2012 I cashed out 120 bitcoins for a grand total of 1.6k usd - which will remain the worst 'investment' ever for the remainder of my life time.

On another note, today I was scanning all my old wallet backups and found 0.04 bitcoin, worth about 2k USD!!!

EDIT: Found all these old transactions where I was throwing around 2.5btc like it was nothing... lol (I used to gamble on the OG bitcoin dice site called SatoshiDice and made a sweet penny from there as well)

Present_Turn7021,0.0,962.0,"I haven‚Äôt been in crypto for very long. Started working at a crypto mining farm in Jan 2018 and it changed my life. 

My employers asked if I was cool getting paid in bitcoin. At the time, my answer was ‚ÄúAs long as I can sell it into Ringgit Malaysia (fiat)‚Äù. Got paid around $1k+ monthly - remembered receiving about 0.2 bitcoin monthly. One day, I didnt have to sell all of it because I already have more than enough fiat. So i figured meh Ill just save it for later. That‚Äôs when it happened. Bitcoin went up 20% from $3k+ to $4.2k and so did my salary. Kept going up and i kept hodling.

Employers turned out to be greedy dicks and changed their minds towards the end - ‚Äúwe are not paying you in precious BTC anymore‚Äù. But my love for crypto remains. 

I was let go shortly after without any compensation and notice after I helped them move their operation to the US where the electricity is a lot lower. Struggled to make ends meet for a little while but doing odd jobs and investing in bitcoin mining got me going. Managed to feed my wife and kid. 

I reinvested mining profits into more machines all around the world with hosting, cloud contracts, and the returns kept compounding. 

Ive never told anyone I have bitcoin except for my wife. I am happily retired at 30 in a country where $200 is a family‚Äôs monthly grocery. For most of the time, I just spend time with my kid and wife who works from home. And to think I owe this lifestyle all to those tiny tiny bitcoins I saved up 3 years ago. HODL friends.

Background: 28 year old with no financial obligations (no house, wife, kids etc). I have a stable job working for a Hedge Fund in London.

The way I see Bitcoin is essentially an asymmetric risk/reward bet. There‚Äôs a possibility it doesn‚Äôt take off from the $10k mark and the price falls indefinitely.

On the flip side there is a multitude of bullish sentiment which could realistically 10x the price over the next 5 years.

My argument is - with house and equity prices at all time highs, what is my best bet to maximise my income for the future? A provably scarce hard asset that has an enormous network effect and the possibility to grow into a multi trillion market seems like a sensible option.

My strategy is definitely not for everyone. I am diversified in the sense that my salary is correlated with the stock market. If BTC and the equity market collapse simultaneously then I will cry myself to sleep for a few days but I‚Äôll still be debt free.

Russel Okung's comments on bitcoin are spot on:

""Money is more than currency; it's power. The way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in Bitcoin is the 1st step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.""

""When we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create ‚Ä¶ In a post-fiat world, you won‚Äôt have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.""

When you have a quarter of the broad money supply being created in less than a year, it is clear that the money printer determines what value is in the first place. If you receive constant government bailouts, either because your company is highly in debt or it secures many jobs, you're never ever going to do anything but to keep your company ""system-relevant"". You're not going to innovate. You're not even competing anymore.

Debt and the money printer killed capitalism.. risk of investing capital is only for the little guy now because they're not relevant enough for the system. Just give them a shitty paying job that we maintain for them at the mercy of our money printer while asset prices inflate away and out of reach.

The money that's being printed creates more debt than actual GDP.

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",Bitcoin,"RIP HAL FINNEY ""His last post on a BTC Forum""",884.0,0.98

What even is our monetary system, policy and national goals with this shit?  I bought enough GME shares to be interested in what was going on and it's a filthy sham.  The hedge funds and capital management entities are pissing on the government, the people, the laws and the rest of the known world.  They're blatantly and transparently breaking laws &amp; regulations, lying and spreading misinformation to our news outlets, buying ads to redirect attention away from their scams, strong arming our brokerages into not selling shares, limiting shares, or straight up stealing peoples shares by forcing them to sell using limit stops that weren't set and couldn't be changed.

How has absolutely nothing been done about their complete lack of accountability?  SEC?  DOJ?  Congress?  Melvin Capital has something to the tune of THIRTY employees, shorting a company's stock over 140% of the floated shares, evidence of counterfeiting shares to short, then failing to deliver, then resetting the cover to kick the can down the road.  The evidence of shares being created and sold out of thin air is astounding.  The ramifications of these actions could bring down themselves, their capital management firm and subsequently the banks and cause a global recession in the worst case scenario.  These things were supposed to have been made illegal in 2008 and put to a stop.  This is UNPRECIDENTED.  A small group of 30 people should NOT have this much influence, should not be able to ladder attack a stocks price from $400 to less than $100 by trading the same few stocks back and forth between each other using lightning fast algorithms.  

This absolutely cannot be allowed.  If they get away with this they'll just have a playbook by which to do this again and again.  Toys R us, GameStop, AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, just to name a few.  Easy targets for these two dozen people to bleed dry, force bankruptcy, unemploy tens of thousands of people and effectively create less competition.

However this ends up, I'm fucking OUT.  I've lost all faith in the US governments ability to enforce anything.  The pandemic showed us they couldn't step up to protect their own tax paying citizens, they drag their feet on regulations to improve healthcare, equality and the environment.  They look the other way when the 1% control the media, the wealth, and are completely immune to laws. 

It's over.  We've seen what our government is capable of (and not) these last few years.  When difficult situations arise, what or WHO comes out to meet it?

I'm already invested in Bitcoin, but after this I'm ALL in.  Every penny that I don't need for the immediate future, bills, food etc. is going into Bitcoin.

Ive never been much of a saver, more of an impulsive spender, and never made much money either. Retirement age was looming and I knew I‚Äôd blown it. I was one of the majority of Americans, facing the possibility of living on a tiny social security wage, or working into my seventies. I needed something that would bring the biggest yields possible. I needed a miracle.

My cannabis friend told me about Bitcoin. I spent my spare time over the next few days devouring every video, every article I could find (thank you Andreas Antonopoulos you are my hero).

I found someone in my county, went to my bank and wired him some money, and he sent me a small amount of Bitcoin. I did this again and again (dude I don‚Äôt remember your name, but I hope you didn‚Äôt get in too much trouble for operating a money changing business back in the day).

I watched my $210 Bitcoin jump to over $1000. I was glued to the price ticker, and I sold the 20 bitcoins I‚Äôd accumulated at $880. Oh how I wish I‚Äôd have HODL‚Äôd at that price!

I started buying again at 440, then at 560, then at 900, 1100, 2200, etc. I set up an automatic buy at Coinbase for $50/week for a good year or two. An unexpected breakup led me at stop that auto buy, but I later resumed it at $10 week. I still have my $10/week buy. I call it my ‚Äúgambling money‚Äù.

Eventually I transferred my Bitcoin onto a hardware wallet, stamped out my keys onto a brass plate, and stashed them away in a safe. I keep a little bit on an exchange, and have cashed out drips and drabs to pay for my daughter‚Äôs college tuition and expenses.

I‚Äôve paid taxes on the gains I‚Äôve taken. 

This week for the first time it hit me. I‚Äôm not going to retire poor. I don‚Äôt have to worry. I don‚Äôt yet have enough for a full retirement, but there is no doubt in my mind that my little HODL‚Äôd stash will grow and grow. What a huge relief. 

I owe a lot to this sub. I‚Äôve been subscribed since 2014, and I‚Äôve learned a ton. A GIANT THANK YOU to all the contributors and the mods. You the real MVP‚Äôs!

Edit: Wow! Thanks guys! I had no idea I would get such a great response. I think I might increase my auto buy to $20 week. Also, maybe I‚Äôll diversify. I hear coinbase is having an IPO soon. I‚Äôll have to look into that!

letmetellyouastry,0.0,869.0," Back in 2013, I saw a once in a lifetime opportunity in Bitcoin.

So I wired $3000 to Mt Gox, bought at $125 at the peak of the bull market (like a sucker!). I day traded and learned exactly why you shouldn‚Äôt day trade before withdrawing what remained 1 month before Mt Gox collapsed. Then I decided to HODL, because I knew I was so far ahead of the adoption curve.

Then I suffered my first bear market. I had bought at the peak and my $3000 was now worth a fraction of that, but thankfully for me I had only invested an amount that I was prepared to lose. That‚Äôs lesson #1 in investing.

Later that year, the price exploded to $1000, I had suddenly made multiples of what I initially invested. But lucky for me I had a stable job and didn‚Äôt feel the need to cash out anything. I was in it for the long term and still saw an extremely asymmetric upside. I didn‚Äôt want to sell until it could make a meaningful impact on my life. The HODL mentality started to make sense.

Then we went through a long bear market. Bitcoin was ‚Äúdead‚Äù but I still held a strong belief that it was still a once in a generation opportunity.

In 2017 things started to pick up, forks started to happen. I immediately sold all of the shitforks for BTC, and strengthened my overall position. Then watched as the price started to really take off.

I sold a small amount to recover my initial $3000 investment as the price rose, this was a strong psychological barrier for me as now I was purely playing with house money, I literally cannot lose as long as I don't go chasing losses.

Then the price went up to $25k AU. Suddenly my portfolio was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Enough to make a difference in my life. I sold about $30k worth just to make sure that, no matter what happens I will walk away with a 10x profit on my initial investment. But the opportunity was too great to ever sell all of what I have. I stayed up at night agonising over my decision not to take big profits, it was a very stressful time for me despite my financial situation being better than ever. This was a stress that I was not prepared for. Getting rich is supposed to be all smooth sailing, right? I was still in a fortunate enough position to be in a well paid stable job, so was still able to hodl despite the stress it was causing me.

Then the price crashed, Bitcoin was ‚Äúdead‚Äù for the 100th time. I went from having hundreds of thousands on paper, to only having tens of thousands. This time it hurt.

I had been through enough bull cycles by this time to know that if/when the next one would eventually came it would dwarf all others. And by the time that happened, what I had learned was that I needed to have a solid plan in place so I could execute it without making irrational decisions.

2020 was a bad year for all of us, but a few months ago things started to stir‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Yesterday I passed $1 million (AU) in hodlings. This was one personal milestone for me, and while I was targeting a profit taking price of $71k AU, I started getting that creeping sense of dread that this could all evaporate again like it did in 2017. I had spent the last week not sleeping, watching charts, watching videos, trying to guess where the price was going. I had my plan, but the price stalled just below the $50k(US) level which correlated to about $63k AU. At this point I had an honest discussion with my amazing fianc√© as the stress was starting to affect my quality of life, I decided to take some decisive action.

I cashed out $200k yesterday, enough to make an impact in my life while still holding onto a majority of my hodlings. This was literally minutes before yesterdays dip happened so the sense of relief that came over me was only further reinforced by the dip that soon followed.

I am now in a position where I have more cash at hand than I ever thought I would, in addition to still hodling onto \~$800k in Bitcoin. Even tho I sold a lot yesterday I still feel like this Bull run has a long way to go. But I took profits that made sense to me in the context of my overall financial position and feel great about my decision. Sure one day that $200k could become $2million eventually, but that is why I still hold a majority of what I initially bought. I will never sell it all. EVER.

My learnings from this whole thing are that the key to realising the upside requires patience and a balanced temperament. If you are a later adopter than me then just know that when the price starts getting into the kind of territory where it can meaningfully shift your life, BE PREPARED FOR THE STRESS THAT IT WILL INDUCE, and have a plan in place to handle it accordingly. Stress makes people make bad decisions and you need to be prepared for this.

I see way too many people in this place who sell everything they have, but the alternative that I suggest is if you start getting uncomfortable then there is no shame in taking profits on the way up. Never EVER sell everything you have, just sell enough to make the creeping sense of dread go away while holding enough to continue riding the revolution that Bitcoin is.

TL:DR;

1. Don't put more than you can afford to lose on the line
2. Don't Day Trade. Most people who read charts are con artists. Just buy, Hodl and be patient.
3. Be prepared for the stress that rising prices will induce
4. Take profits that make sense to your financial position to alleviate the stress on the way up
5. Never, EVER sell everything. The opportunity is far too great to miss.
6. If we enter another bear market, HODL on harder than ever. You will be rewarded eventually.",Bitcoin,Lessons I have learned in the last 8 years.,869.0,0.97

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin created and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you how much time until the next drop in block rewards.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), a second layer scaling solution currently rolling out on the Bitcoin mainnet.  
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the lightning network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

* [Cash app](https://cash.app/)
* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [Cex](https://cex.io/)
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [P2P exchange list](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) (decentralized) 

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/).  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) or [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""** meaning if you don't store your coins in a wallet that you control the keys to then you do not really own your bitcoin as you have to ask permission from the third party in order to move them.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&amp;hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins (shitcoins) are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Common Bitcoin Myths

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://getumbrel.com/).  You can view the [global node distribution](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/) for a visual representation of the node network.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in recent Electrum wallet releases
bit | bit | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin (ŒºBTC)
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10000 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100k sats

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

At the moment talking about buying BTC can be intimidating due to the value of a single BTC and its volatility. If people started to think of buying a Sat, rather than a BTC, it would be easier to digest, and the perceived volatility would drop too, because we‚Äôre talking cents rather than thousand of dollars.

We‚Äôre now at a value that makes sense too. I can buy 10,000 sats for less than $5 USD. That‚Äôs a bargain!",Bitcoin,It‚Äôs time to start talking about buying Sats and not BTC,843.0,0.96
Mooks79,0.0,842.0,"Lately, in particular, there‚Äôs been *a lot* of posts along the lines of people celebrating their first BTC purchase or getting to some milestone like 1 BTC. While I share in their happiness I‚Äôm concerned that this is making (often relatively new and naive) BTC owners targets for scammers and unnecessarily increases their risk of being scammed of their BTC. 

Should this community ban these sorts of posts for those guys‚Äô own good, or should it allow them to make their own mistakes and those of us concerned about them can carry on making warning comments?

**Update**:

Ok I was planning to leave this run for at least 24 hours before updating but I‚Äôve got so many replies already by that time I won‚Äôt have a hope of summarising them all. So here goes. 

First, to all those a little overzealous in their ‚Äúyou authoritarian bastard‚Äù responses - as my comments below elaborate, I don‚Äôt actually think banning is the right solution but was being a little provocative to get the discussion(s) going. For the record. 

I haven‚Äôt done a thorough count of all the yes/no answers but I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs roughly a 50/50 split. Perhaps a few more yes than no, but the no‚Äôs tend to be more upvoted.

The most common reasons for the **yes** answers are primarily:

* it‚Äôs really annoying / useless posts etc
* it makes them a target when they don‚Äôt know any better and this would protect them

The most common reasons for the **no** answers are:

* it‚Äôs authoritarian / against the whole ethos of BTC
* we need to educate these people not ban their posts

I think, realistically, the best suggestion was made by u/Ragnarokiee, so I will put this up as my (their) *real* proposal:

Why are they so scared? Bitcoin is step one in curbing wealth inequality since it will be a lot more difficult for any institution to manipulate. They won't be able to just turn on the money printer to pump their stocks, meaning that we will no longer see the stock market grow while the consumer price index stays relatively stable (basically what I'm saying is that they put more money in the stock market while the money supply of everyday people stays the same, increasing wealth inequality). 

Back to my main point; bitcoin mining isn't being run off of oil and coal like all of these other companies news agencies don't seem to have a problem with. They're scared for different reasons.

In dollar terms, I‚Äôm almost a bitcoin millionaire. It feels good, but not because I can brag about the accumulated wealth, it‚Äôs more that the people who I told to invest whatever money they could afford to lose, back in early 2013, all told me I was an idiot. Those same people have now been humbled.

The story starts back in late 2012. A guy I was on head-nodding terms with at the gym, got talking to me in the changing room about one of the podcasts he was listening to. He was talking about how he loved his weed and had heard about the Silk Road and how the only way to buy drugs on it was using this new ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù currency called bitcoin. It was in November 2012 and the price was hovering around $10-$11. I thought to myself, I love my weed - and I remember from years and years ago, a company in Canada called bud mail, used to operate an online weed store. That‚Äôs where my thinking stopped - and I didn‚Äôt bother looking into it any further.

**Acquiring my first coins**  
In early Jan 2013 my mate had mentioned bitcoin to me, again - a big weed smoker and thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to grab a few coins and try it out for ourselves. We‚Äôre in the UK, and Coinbase wasn‚Äôt open for UK residents yet. The only way we could purchase bitcoins were on localbitcoins.com or bitstamp. We chose the latter, but had no idea what a SEPA transfer was. To be frank, there were a lot of hurdles to overcome in order to acquire bitcoin back then.

We had to use TransferWise to send our money to some bank in Estonia (I think?). The money arrived a few days later, and bam - we were able to purchase our first coins in March 2013 at $57 a pop. The next few days, the price continued to rise - until it got to about $230. This was heavily fuelled by the Cyprus Haircut. The other two mates who I‚Äôd bought these coins with, and who I shared the bitstamp account with wanted to sell. I didn‚Äôt. We decided that I would take my coins off the exchange, and they‚Äôd keep theirs together at bitstamp. It was at this stage that I was looking into bitcoin security.

**Paper Wallets**  
Trusty bitcoinpaperwallet.com taught me all I needed to know. I ran a few tests first with very small amounts. Sending some to paper wallets, and then sweeping those paper wallets so that I could trust that it all worked. It did.

**Acquiring more knowledge, then more coins**  
By now, I was deep into the rabbit hole, but I always felt it was important to invest as much (if not more) of my time into learning how bitcoin worked, and how to skill up on my bitcoin opsec. I should state, with bitcoin - you never stop learning. The beauty of this thing is it constantly evolves. As I got more comfortable with my knowledge, I bought more coins, still only ploughing in what I could afford to lose and not care about. 

**2013 High**  
It was December 2013, and the price had reached \~$1200. The friends and family I‚Äôd told about it were all screaming at me to sell - ‚Äúyou‚Äôve made more than 20x your investment‚Äù.

I told them the same thing then as I tell them now - that they didn‚Äôt understand that this was a new paradigm. This thing is going to change the world, and yes the price is volatile, but if you understand the fundamentals of bitcoin, and have even a tiny grasp of macro economics and how messed up the system was, it was obvious that bitcoin was born to absorb all of the endless money printing etc. Back then, money printing was nowhere near the scale we‚Äôve seen in the past 12 months.

**Bear market until late 2017**  
I had everyone telling me how stupid I was for not selling. After the 2013 high, we wouldn‚Äôt see the price exceed it‚Äôs previous ATH for another 4 years. Whilst everyone was telling me how stupid I was, I was continuing to buy. I was continuing to extol the fantastic qualities of bitcoin, and how it had previously had bull and bear cycles that was heavily influenced by the halved supply of coins every 4 years. They looked at me like I was talking a different language. They didn‚Äôt want to invest their time understanding how things worked. All they knew was that every single news outlet was saying that Bitcoin was for terrorists and criminals. I continued going to as many bitcoin meetups as I could. Listening to some of the bitcoin veterans live on stage. It was still very fringe back then, but I was lucky to speak to people such as Andreas Antonopolous, Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Jeremy Allaire, Jameson Lopp, and others. Some of these people will be remembered for the wrong reasons, but at the time - it seemed all of them had good intentions for bitcoin. I still follow Andreas and Jameson, and genuinely think they're some of the most intelligent and visionary minds out there.

**Christmas 2017**  
I remember it well. I was with my family out for dinner and the price was close to $20k. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you still haven‚Äôt sold‚Äù, they said. I blurted out the same mantra that I did back in 2013. I didn't sell.

**2018**  
We all know how this year went. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, the few people who knew I had bitcoin thought I was silly for not selling. I knew in my heart of hearts I wasn‚Äôt. I stuck to the plan, and continued accumulating.

**2019 - IVF**  
Me and my wife had struggled trying to conceive. I won‚Äôt go into all the details but suffice to say, I don‚Äôt come from a particularly wealthy background. That‚Äôs not to say that I was a deprived kid - I wasn‚Äôt, but I certainly didn‚Äôt come from a wealthy background. In order for me and my wife to have our first child, it was becoming obvious that the only option left to us at this point was IVF. IVF was going to cost the best part of ¬£30-¬£40k. 

I‚Äôm a true hodler, but I felt that I had been extremely lucky to find bitcoin at the time I did, and so I‚Äôd sold a decent amount of coins to fund the IVF. Yes, I could have sold some in late 2017, and liquidated fewer coins to get to the amount I needed - but I didn‚Äôt know back then that we‚Äôd go down the IVF route.

**2020 - No regrets**  
In January 2020, our little baby boy was born. Our bitcoin baby. A baby, that I honestly don‚Äôt think we would have been able to have, had it not been for me stumbling across bitcoin and disregarding all of the naysayers along the way. He‚Äôs the light of our lives, and if bitcoin went to zero, I‚Äôd still be an absolute winner! At this point, I've cashed out about 3x of all the money I've put into bitcoin, and still have a sizeable portion of my coins left.

**2021**  
It‚Äôs the first day of 2021, and whilst I‚Äôm not quite at $1m in terms of my btc holdings, I‚Äôm not far off, but better than that, the friends and family that told me to sell are no longer saying ""why don‚Äôt you sell?"", but asking how they can buy. I could be an arsehole about it, but that‚Äôs just not me. I continue to help anyone and everyone that shows any kind of interest in this.

**The Future**  
I think the next 24 months are going to be extremely exciting. I‚Äôm hoping to get to a point whereby me, my wife and my son can move into our forever home. I have plans for a 50% equity payment, leaving the rest of my coins to hopefully accumulate more value so that at a later stage, I can pay the rest of the mortgage off, and live a debt free life. 

**To conclude**  
I never thought I‚Äôd accumulate the wealth I currently have. It‚Äôs still peanuts in terms of what some people in this world have gained (looking at you Bezos), but if it means that I can quit my job, to spend more time with my family, and putting my precious time into learning new things, being more charitable with my time and generally living life to the max - then I‚Äôll be a very happy man.

BTC survived 2017's attempted coup, but that will not be the last time they try. And next time, those attempting the coup will be much more sophisticated, with deeper pockets, a thorough understanding of BTC's protocol and its weaknesses, a paid army of programmers and private keys to large quantities of BTC, if not the majority of it. For all we know, someone somewhere already has a plan and is laying the groundwork for it. I say this because even though code and math cannot be bought, corrupted, imprisoned or executed, the people and institutions that write them can.

The closer we are to the moon, the more dangerous and treacherous the road gets. We need cautious optimism, rather than allowing our greed to lead us to blinding euphoria.

Which is more important; that we individually become wealthy, or that we collectively have BTC endure in this world?

To those who are asking what we can do to stay vigilant, or what we can do against huge banks buying BTC, these are a few ways you can make BTC stronger: 

* learn and run a full node; 
* learn about the base protocol, how concensus works, and what makes it all possible. That way, if malicious changes are proposed again, we can rally against them as strongly as we did in 2017.
* Get your coins out of exchanges and take on the real risk of self-custody.
* Continue engaging with the community.

I was born and raised in an upper-middle income family in Mexico City under catholic values but turned agnostic as I grew older. I kept the values that made sense, such as the importance of charity and giving back, and threw away the ones that were outdated, such as the focus on guilt as a motivator of change.

As a kid, I remember how conflicting it was to see other kids working in the streets, starving, drugged, and abused. I couldn‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt focus on their education the way I did. That planted a seed in my spirit that still grows.

**Seeing in economics hope**

As a teenager, I entered the rabbit hole of economics with hope. Economics seemed to be this mystical force capable of solving the world‚Äôs biggest problems: poverty, corruption, global warming, and many more. I knew that the way we were doing economics was wrong and I wanted to change that.

Just think about the horrible things that have been done under the name of communism, such as the Cambodian genocide, or how the United States, the crown jewel of capitalism, makes of fundamental rights, such as healthcare and education, profitable businesses instead of granting everyone equal access to them.

While studying my undergrad, I quickly fell out of love with the idealistic idea of economics as an almighty force that can conquer all evils. I saw how economics was often used as an excuse to force simplistic representations of culture and society into complex problems. I never understood how that approach of thinking about problems in a vacuum could be useful.

**Understanding the power of financial services**

Later in my life, while working as a consultant for McKinsey, I finally understood the importance of financial institutions. They decide who should do business and have access to goods and services and who shouldn‚Äôt. And financial institutions don‚Äôt grant everyone that right. It was clear to me that that was a problem that needed fixing. That‚Äôs why I devoted so much time studying this industry back then.

I came to Berkeley to Business School more out of inertia than out of will. I was sponsored by McKinsey and had an offer to go back. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what to do with the experience, but I knew I wanted to keep exploring financial services. During my MBA, I heard about Bitcoin in a serious academic environment for the first time and it immediately caught my interest.

Via Berkeley-SkyDeck, UC Berkeley's accelerator, I heard about lastbit (lastbit.io) for the first time. I read everything I could about the project and about the founder, this cool, heavy-metal lover, who wanted to change the world with the disruptive power of Bitcoin. I could see myself in him. I had to meet him. After failing to meet him in person at an event, I just cold emailed him praying for him to answer. He did.

That‚Äôs how I came in contact with Prashanth for the first time, this impressive 25-year-old genius who managed to get Charlie Lee on board of his project with little more than a prototype. There‚Äôs a reason why he managed to do this. Today Bitcoin is almost impossible to spend. With Prashanth‚Äôs his solution, anyone will be able to swipe a card or tap their phone and pay with Bitcoin instantly anywhere where they are able to pay with their credit card today. Something not so long ago possible only in bitcoiners‚Äô dreams. Through Prashanth I finally understood what Bitcoin really is. It blew my mind.

**Unveiling the real meaning of Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is not an investment asset, it‚Äôs the possibility of a new social contract. Bitcoin is a decentralized, transparent, and auditable network to store and transmit value to which everyone in the world can have access to. This presents a real opportunity to redefine money, which today is inherently centralized, first by central banks, and then by financial institutions. The centralization of money has at least three critical problems that Bitcoin solves.

First, there is a macroeconomic problem that has to do with monetary policy and that today with the COVID-19 economic crisis is more relevant than ever. Money is supposed to be a reflection of real economic value, but some central banks print money arbitrarily. Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary supply is limited by design. Second, centralized financial services are discriminatory and don‚Äôt allow free access to everyone. Bitcoin is universal and free. This means that for the first time in human history, everyone will be able to participate in the global economy. And participation is the pillar of democracy. Third, central authorities control private information. The recent attacks to high profile account on Twitter illustrate how vulnerable private information is when stored in centralized networks. Bitcoin allows people to have full ownership and control of their personal and financial information, protecting both their identity and their wealth.

As such, Bitcoin emerged in front of my eyes as a way to instrument basic democratic principles in a way in which everyone can have equal representation. Money as we know it will soon be a thing of the past because money as we know it not fair nor egalitarian and now people can choose.

Reporter: ""Have you thought about trading cryptocurrency futures to take a negative position on bitcoin?""

Warren Buffett: ""No, I get into enough problems with things that I think I know something about, why in the world would I take a long or short position of something that I don't know anything about?""

Yet, in the same interview, Buffett also states that: ""In terms of cryptocurrencies, genereally, I can almost say with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.""

And further that: ""We don't own any, we don't short any, we'll never have a position in them.""

These statements are contradictory. He says that he doesn't understand it, yet he claims that he can say with certainty that it will take ""a bad ending"" (whatever that means). Still, he wouldn't short it. Indeed, he would shy away from taking any position at all.

Has he formed somewhat more of a consistent opinion nowadays and expressed it?

I hold a few BTC. Less than 50, more than 10. I bought most of them in 2014. I've spent a few here and there, but have been DCAing pretty much constantly over the last few years, although because the price has gone up so much, I've probably added less than 1 BTC to my total in the last 3 years.

All my coins are on a hardware wallet. I used to use paper, but got paranoid about losing it. I like hardware wallets, they're the best of a bad situation.

And by ""bad situation"" I mean that *I don't want* to be my own bank. About 80% of my total net worth is tied up in BTC, and I can tell you, it's quite stressful to be responsible for that much value in one place. My remaining net worth is mostly tied up in my house, and in various stocks and shares, and I'm much more relaxed about that.

Owning BTC is constantly in the back of my mind, and I don't mean the worry of the value going down. I'm sure the value will continue to rise, and even if it doesn‚Äôt, I'm totally at peace with that. The thing which is always in the back of my mind is knowing that, if somehow I lose my balance, I'll have no comeback. I want it to be in a bank where I get cover. I don't stress about losing my stocks and shares because the brokers I use are covered, and because, well, it's their \*job\* to look after my money. I'm just a regular Joe, I don't want to be my own bank.  Oh, and I know the stats about how secure hardware wallets are etc. so I'm not looking for reassurance about that, it's simply that looking after it is stressful, regardless of how secure it is.  Not to mention the additional worry about what happens if I die.  If it was in a bank my next of kin would just take over ownership.  As it is, I have to do something to make sure that if I die unexpectedly my next of kin are able to access my crypos.

I like that I can my own bank (for smaller, say &lt; $10k value amounts), but if BoA came out with an account tomorrow which I could transfer my BTC to, I would. And you know what, I'd sleep better too.

Welp, that's it folks. All the BTC I had to to my name has been stolen on 11/13.

After checking my wallet a couple of days ago, I noticed an unfamiliar transaction that sent my remaining Bitcoins to some address on 11/13.

Not sure if it's a good idea to post the transaction ID, but I suppose I could if it sheds light on anything.

After I saw this, a rush of emotions came over me - despair, hopelessness, I had a pit in my stomach that was so dense, I nearly wanted to throw up. I could barely eat or sleep the day after. Even though it's been a few days now, those feelings are still very strong and I feel they probably will be for a long time. I keep waking up and checking the wallet hoping it's some sort of mistake, but it's real unfortunately.

It took a while for me to process through the situation just enough to put some thoughts together for this post, but I guess the point of this post is two fold:

1. It's a bit cathartic for me to be able to get some thoughts out
2. I hope that other people learn from my mistake - coin holders need to take security seriously. Be patient, learn about security of your coins, and enact what you learn. Be diligent. Convenience is an enemy of security.

The coins I had were originally mined back some time in 2013 if I remember correctly.

I really had no idea what I was doing at the time, but a friend turned me on to mining and I figured why not, may as well put my GPUs to use for something else while I wasn't gaming. When he first told me about mining, I thought hmm - I bet all this computing power is going to something like helping the government crack into things, but after some light reading on Bitcoin - it stood out to me as something special, so I decided to do some research, joined a pool and started mining some coins not long after.

Over the years, I sort of forgot about them and they stayed within my Bitcoin core wallet what I had used originally when mining, but three to four years ago my interest in the technology renewed and I really started reading more into the details of the technology and talking about it with coworkers.

However, after some time I noticed that the Bitcoin core client was becoming quite cumbersome having to store all of the blockchain data and I had moved on to laptops with less storage available than my old desktop and so I started looking at some of the more modern wallets and landed on Electrum.

I started using Electrum and it seemed to do the job well for what a wallets was designed for. I guess it's my mistake for not keeping up with the real (security related) news surrounding Bitcoin and wallets and various hacks and scams. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I'm pretty sure I fell victim to a phishing attack vector within the Electrum wallet and possibly was led to download an update from a location other than the main site (github releases section seems to be faintly a thing that I remember). It was either this, or maybe my system was compromised some other way - either way it's a painful lesson in how not keep your coins secure. I really should have just put my coins into cold/offline storage.

It's a real shame, I was really proud of owning these coins having mined them originally myself and I was hoping one day that I could split them between my two sons when they were old enough to understand and appreciate the technology in 18-20 years and who knows how widespread the technology and understanding will be by then. I feel like I failed them.

I'm not really sure where to go from here, still trying to work through that. I've definitely been reading up more on security and how to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again should I find my way back into crypto. I wish I would have taken security more seriously up front, it ended up being a very costly mistake not doing so.

I don't have nearly the disposable income to get back what I have lost. At the current price, it'd take years upon years, and it's highly unlikely that the price will retreat significantly. However, I truly still do believe in the technology, I just find it a bit sad that the main way to participate now is to convert USD to BTC - I wish mining was still a thing for the average person.

Stay diligent and vigilant people, don't become lax like me. Read up on methodologies and practices for keeping your coins secure. Be patient and take the time to make sure things are done right.

If this post helps even one person to take their coins more seriously and read up on better security, then I suppose it would be worth it getting these thoughts out. I wouldn't wish the feelings that I've experienced over the past couple of days on anyone, they are truly feelings of despair and regret.

EDIT 1 (12/7): Posting the TxID seems to be a popular request. Here it is:

b54a451c19e0a5e69c9c9bc0073d2499118bf574da254937ee698996f58181fb

I tried following it myself, but I'm not a blockchain expert, but from what I'm seeing they redistributed the funds through many other wallets which I guess is a common tactic to reduce chance of being tracked.

Note that when I got back into the technology 3-4 years ago and talking about it with coworkers, I was made aware of other chain forks and did claim some BCH, BitcoinGold, Clams, and BSV - I followed guides for moving the funds to new wallets after having to give up my private keys. It should only be a couple of hops (4-5?) to see that these were mined back in 2013 or so. All in all, I had mined around 4 total, but traded some away when I got back into it 3-4 years ago around the time altcoins started gaining popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2 (12/7): Thanks all for the responses. I enjoy reading them all, even the critical ones (as those are the ones that help you grow). I posted this right before I went to sleep last night which is why I was slow to respond to comments and post the TxID.

First, I'm not looking for pity here - I realize the mistakes I made are purely my own. First - I should have done my due diligence and researched hardware wallets more seriously. I've always been leery and untrustful of USB devices which is why I irrationally dismissed hardware wallets previously.

I will attempt to write as much of it down here (I'm curious to hear your thoughts and whether you agree or think I'm a mad man), but we had so many interesting ideas that I wish I had it on video or some shit. 

Basically, we are big stock guys who dabbled in bitcoin, but have never fully committed. But after this, we are 100% on board. 

So basically, as you know, retail investing has been on the rise. More and more people have begun investing, and they are only beginning to realize the power they have. You don't need go be a billionaire to invest, and honestly the whole system is kind of bullshit. People claim stock prices are built on ""fundamentals"" and they are to some extent. But every stock has INTRINSIC value (the ""fundamentals"", EPS, value for having a successful business, ect) and extrinsic value (hype, speculation on future, ect) This whole GME thing has made people realize that. They banded together and moved a market, sticking it to the guys at the top. However, trading was halted, and with malicious intent or not, Robinhood and its billionaire investors halted trading, ending the retail revolution. 

So, now that people realize that stocks are bullshit with whatever value we collectively place on them, and that they have power in numbers... what is the logical conclusion?

BITCOIN

More and more people will realize that decentralized finance is better in every way. It's sticking it to the government, not allowing them to manipulate and control every aspect of the financial system. If everyone just holds, everyone could be rich, and bitcoin could begin to rival the US dollar, with investors who got in relatively early being rich like all the hedge funds. Unlike in the stock market, no institution could halt trading, meaning there is literally no way bitcoin could be rejected. It's like the snowball effect. It will just keep getting bigger and bigger as it gains more institutional and retail support. 

For part two of our theory, we realized that after our last president showed just how influential social media can be to politics, it is only a matter of time before someone runs for office on the platform of  Bitcoin and decentralized finance. Because decentralized finance would benefit everyone in the country, it could be a wildly popular opinion, and even a way forward into the future. All it takes is for this OBVIOUS idea of someone tying bitcoin to politics to happen.

I‚Äôve been researching money profoundly (for an [article ](https://lastbit.io/a-brief-history-of-money/)series I‚Äôm currently publishing for a Lightning startup I‚Äôm interning with), trying to understand how centralization of money evolved over time.

Historically, the overall trend of money has been towards centralization of power. Before money as a concept existed, anyone could barter anything, anytime, anyplace, without any interference. Ultimate decentralization. 

Over time, institutions became a necessary complement for barley money and weighted metal, and then went from complementary to fundamentally nuclear with metal coins and fiat bills. This trend towards centralization has been almost a constant over the last 5,000 years or more. Then came Bitcoin...

Bitcoin is decentralized throughout the community of users. Creation and transactions are scattered through a worldwide network of servers to which anyone can join. All you need to participate in the system is to have access to the internet. **Institutions aren‚Äôt fundamental anymore.** 

This decentralization might just be what we need in a time were people are tired of having to give up their power to those who they feel don‚Äôt represent them. This is an age were we reclaim a freedom that we had long forgotten was even possible. Last week comes to mind with Robinhood going against their users and blocking them from the free market. Bitcoin might just be a shield to protect ourselves from those in power.",Bitcoin,[Discussion] We all know Bitcoin is highly decentralized.

Raverrevolution,0.0,645.0,"I keep seeing lots of posts about people worried that the price is going up so much that they'll never get a chance to own a full coin.

We need to take a step back and look at the psychology of this and why people are coming up with this thought.

First of all the word ""Bitcoin"" contains the word ""coin"" in it.  What we typically refer to as coins these days makes us think that they should be cheap and you should be able to obtain them very easily.  The reason this is even like this is because the USD (I'm in the US so using our money as example) has constantly been inflating forever making 1 dollar the standard choice of use.  40 years ago coins could still buy you something so they didn't always come with a cheap connotation to them.

Secondly once you get past the name you need to come to the realization that 1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 sats.  At the point of mass adoption the general public will be lucky to even have 1,000 sats given that people can't even come up with $400 emergency money.  Right now $1 USD buys you 5,591 sats.  20 years from now when you tell someone that you had the chance to get that many sats for a dollar they will be SOOOOOOOO jealous.  Meanwhile now you're stressing you don't have 100,000,000.

Stressing at that is the same as someone getting upset that they don't have 1 billion dollars now.  Wouldn't you be more than fine with 20 million now?  Hell, you could live a great life with 2 million alone.  If the answer is yes then 20,000,000 sats (0.2 bitcoin = $3,569) should make you filthy rich in the future.

Last, but not least you have to understand that 1 Bitcoin is literally just a label (an amount, a unit of measure) and not what's transacting through the network.  For example in comparison we have pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, etc..  I can give you 5 pennies or give you 1 nickel.  On the bitcoin network the only thing that's transacting are sats.  Sending a bitcoin is sending many sats.  It's ONLY sats.  1 Bitcoin is merely just a label, not an actual ""coin"" per se.",Bitcoin,You don't need to own a full coin,645.0,0.95

AnAnaGivingUp,0.0,647.0,"**One of the last posts made by Hal Finney on¬†bitcointalk.org. For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from... Satoshi (for the uninitiated still, the builder of Bitcoin)...**

""I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.""

PM__YOUR__DOGGO,0.0,628.0,"As someone that's been involved in bitcoin for almost a decade now, watching the WSB drama last week rekindled an old understanding in me.

I get the intention of WSB - the financial system is completely and utterly broken, and fighting it is *good*. Hedge funds are tiny little fish though, and the Bitcoin community had spent years fighting a war so much bigger than that. The war against Central Banking.

The scale is completely and utterly different. **All** the Hedge Funds in *the entire world* managed just over 3 trillion dollar's worth of assets in 2019 - accumulated over many decades, in many countries.[1]

The United State's Federal Reserve *created* more than 3.4 trillion USD in 2020 alone.

Yes, one central bank printed in one year more money than is managed by all the hedge funds in the whole world.

*This* is what Bitcoin is up against. This is the scale of this war. **And this is the war we're here to win.**

Nuck16,0.0,628.0,"Most of the selling pressure since mid-Jan has come from F2Pool (largest Chinese mining pool) affiliated wallets and it is now becoming clear why.  The Inner Mongolia region of China is banning bitcoin mining.  This region is responsible for 9% of the world's BTC mining.  It's a coal powered region however, which is the problem.  Beijing has come down on them for not meeting carbon neutrality targets.   They have until end of April to shut down, but it would appear they first got notice of this back in mid-January based on the BTC selling history.   Most will likely either move to the surplus hydro power regions of China or they will sell their rigs and shut down.  Apparently some will even be moving overseas. Many of these miners secured loans using their mining rigs as collateral, either to pay their bills so they didn't have to sell coin while the price was rising, or to buy more rigs  or bitcoin...but either way many are forced to sell some or all of their bitcoin to pay back loans or pay for their move.

[https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry](https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry)

The big question is, when will this selling stop?  End of April seems like the logical answer but I suspect it will taper off well before then.  Anyone moving, would have started the process by now I suspect.

There does also 'appear' to be F2Pool affiliated manipulation selling at times as well, like when there is heavy selling prior to the month end futures expiry they are involved.  However, there does seem to be a lot of coordinated FUD around this same time period which has me thinking other players are involved in this end of month manipulation and it's possible that some or all of the F2 selling at end of month could just be panic selling, like if they were waiting for a higher price to sell, but pulled the trigger when they saw the price starting to plunge down.  Hard to say for sure.  When it comes to futures expiries and for example call options, there is usually a particular strike price that jumps out at you in term of open interest.  For example, for tomorrow's weekly expiry, $50K is the price that jumps out at you.  I told a friend a few days ago don't be surprised if the price is 49K on Friday.  If that theory holds, the following week, the magic price is $66K, so let's see if we see a very strong next week.

One thing I've noticed of late is that the only time BTC price goes down is when there is selling pressure from F2Pool and whenever they are not selling the price surges higher.  So the big takeaway is that when they stop selling, we should see a moon shot.

OneCleverPuppy,0.0,625.0,"Having observed this sub for a few days, I would like to point out to all newcomers five things:

- Most of us here, myself included, hold some bitcoin, and thus are incentivised to convince others to buy and hold, because that pushes the price up. And so: do not naively believe advice you receive here.
- The same is true of famous people like the Winklevosses, funds trying to sell bitcoin products to other investors, etc.
- Especially, be careful of the current high prices. BTC has only been above $13k for a couple of months now. Think about whether you want to be stuck at prices less than you bought for for months or years.
- The more exuberant everyone becomes, the higher the price forecasts. A few days ago, punters were claiming $300k is possible, now you hear $1mn, etc. Do not believe this self-serving hype for the reasons I outlined in my first two points. No one knows what's going to happen. If anyone was absolutely sure the price would go that high, it would not be whipping around at $19k because they'd be buying everything.
- For the same reasons, don't let anyone here convince you that contrarian views about bitcoin are invalid. If you want to invest, you have to look at all sources of information about future prices and make up your own mind by evaluating the arguments. Be careful of falling into the trap of only listening to sources saying things that you want to believe (for example, because you want to become a millionaire without working for it; not judging - I'm in the same boat). This idea of considering who has a vested interest and who does not is an important criterion when evaluating people's views.

Please everyone else stay calm. I'm not saying BTC is a scam or whatever. I'm just telling people arriving at this sub not to trust you, for reasons you can't argue against: your vested interest. That is a fact, not a speculation about the current or future state of bitcoin. I genuinely hope we all make a ton of money, but I don't want it to be on the backs of marginally informed people being suckered into buying at record prices.

FINAL EDIT: Wow so many little badge gizmos, I feel like a boy scout. Thank you kindly, all! It makes it worth the random abuse in some comments.
Also, thank you to commenters with interesting things to say for your engagement. As it gets late I'm finding it harder to stay kind and positive in the face of the unwarranted abuse, so I'm going to leave this thread now while I have a light heart and still feel like I've done some good.

belcher_,0.0,629.0,"Suppose Alice has bitcoins and wants to send them with maximal privacy, so she creates a special kind of transaction. For anyone looking at the blockchain her transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from bitcoin address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z which is entirely unconnected to either A or B.

Now imagine another user, Carol, who isn't too bothered by privacy and sends her bitcoin using a regular wallet. But because Carol's transaction looks exactly the same as Alice's, anybody analyzing the blockchain must now deal with the possibility that Carol's transaction actually sent her coins to a totally unconnected address. So Carol's privacy is improved even though she didn't change her behaviour, and perhaps had never even heard of this software.

In a world where advertisers, social media and other companies want to collect all of Alice's and Carol's data, such privacy improvement would be incredibly valuable. And also the doubt added to every transaction would greatly boost the fungibility of bitcoin and so make it a better form of money.

This undetectable privacy can be developed today by implementing CoinSwap. The software could be standalone as a kind of bitcoin mixing app, but it could also be a library that existing wallets can implement allowing their users to send Bitcoin transactions with much greater privacy.


For the last few months I've been working on implementing this project, and recently reached another milestone: Multi-hop CoinSwaps.

In the original CoinSwap design there would be only two peers involved, that meant if your wallet did a CoinSwap the other party knew exactly where your coins went. They were a single point of failure in privacy. Multi-hop CoinSwap is where the user routes their coins of multiple CoinSwap peers, and all of them need to collude in order to figure out the final source and destination of the coins.


Just for fun I created a 5-hop CoinSwap on testnet. Each hop has 3 individual transactions:

These transactions don't look particularly special (which is the point), but they are CoinSwaps. Following the CoinSwap protocol, those coins are transferred off-chain to the next market maker. Even though the coin are unspent at the time of writing, they are unilaterally controlled by the other party.

The user created a CoinSwap for 0.05 tBTC in this case (but it could have been any amount), and out the other side they got the same amount of coins (minus a fee) entirely disconnected to their initial coins. The fee goes to the makers which provides them an incentive to cooperate to improve privacy, and also gets spent on miner fees.

From the point of view of someone just passively observing the blockchain, a single-hop CoinSwap is as private as a multi-hop CoinSwap, so I suspect in practice most users will just create 1-hop or 2-hop CoinSwaps.


These example CoinSwaps have a visible 2-of-2 multisig address. But the plan is to later use a protocol called ECDSA-2P which allows us to create 2-of-2 multisig addresses that look the same as regular single-signature addresses. This allows CoinSwaps to blend in with the rest of the bitcoin transactions out there. Even the legacy p2pkh addresses starting with 1 can be CoinSwap addresses.

CoinSwap is the next generation of bitcoin on-chain privacy tech. It improves on CoinJoin because it breaks the transaction graph, and even improves the privacy of people who don't use it. CoinSwap also uses less block space for the same privacy and therefore is cheaper in miner fees.
