Well this past week I went to mass and confession after about a year away from the church, and suddenly, all that passion and excitement for my relationship with Christ that I felt when I was confirmed came back to me.

Last night, I was reading a few chapters of Luke before doing my penance, and I paused for a moment, pulled out my phone and deleted my OnlyFans account. It took a lot to do, and I felt overwhelming temptation to not do so, but the wave of relief that flooded me when I hit that delete button was unlike anything I have experienced.

Sure, one could be forgiven were he drawn to, say, Eastern Orthodoxy, what with the cool beards and the mesmerizing chants (don't get me wrong, I love the Eastern tradition), but Catholicism... ugh, right?

My father thinks I've gone crazy (""I believe in science!"" Me too, dad, me too: gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit). My wife is positively angry that I could, in her words, let myself be brainwashed. And her eyes gleam with such scorn and naked hate when she talks about prayer, the Rosary or the Saints, that sometimes I really do wonder if there might be something else, more sinister at play (perish the thought!)... 

(Yet all this makes me want to love them more and pray even more earnestly for them. Meditating on the Sorrowful Mysteries is especially fruitful (pun intended) for me.)

To think that I thought I had a secret weapon.

Not to convert them. But at least to make them pause.

And entertain the idea, maybe. That this is not ""brainwashing"".

After all, I am an educated guy, an intellectual bulimic with a Master's degree in Classics, or rather your average insufferable know-it-all history buff and languages nerd, a voracious reader of Old Boring Books (tm), AND a former militant atheist to boot. My conversion should at least bring them to stop and think that there may be something to my madness. Right? I mean right?  After all, did I not convert via philosophy? Did I not desperately fight with all my pride against that conversion? Does this not register?

Turns out that no. It does not.

Christ made me see my pride and vanity, but I was not ready to see what others really thought about me. My opinion holds no sway after all. All glory to you, Lord! Have mercy upon me!

But what about the company I was now keeping, the countless thinkers, writers, artists and mystics that enriched our great tradition, do they not forbid one to  simply brand our faith as ""ignorant"" or ""obscurantist""? I would say: ""do you think Pascal or C.S. Lewis, Aquinas or Simone Weil are idiots? Do you think, we, in the West, stand on the shoulders of bigoted fools, all of them?""

I thought this made for a really strong case, at the very least, for the ""weight"" of the Christian outlook. At least, this is what always made me uneasy about my own triumphalist attitude towards the past. But maybe this simply is a question of humility? Dare I say of supernatural humility?

I remember when I was in high school I wanted to become a Christian, but at that time, it was more to escape what I felt was an oppressive religion (Islam), I didn't really have a deeper understanding of what it meant to be a Christian, or, specifically, a Catholic.

Now, a little more than ten years, later, our Lord God called me into questioning the Islamic faith and ultimately a journey into a walk with Christ. It was not easy at first, as I looked more into the questionable grounds on which the Islamic faith stood. I truly searched in earnest for support of the faith I had grown up in and loved. But as I searched deeper, I could not ignore reason and what was clear to me--Jesus Christ, our Lord, and what he has called onto us. I love my family, who are so important in my life, and it was so difficult for me to let go of what they have taught me and what they love. It still is, and I still haven't shared with them how I feel.

I'm someone who's always struggled with depression and anxiety, but as I've been praying the Rosary everyday and reading the Bible every day for the last few months--I can honestly say, I've never known more peace (to the point where I QUIT the toxic antidepressants and benzos I was on).

I still haven't gone through RCIA, as it's been a bit of a challenge to get in touch with my local parishes because of COVID. But nonetheless, I have been watching virtual mass, and loving it more and more every week, and I cannot wait to get baptized and officially become a Catholic.

With the protests in Poland as well as the US election, I have seen an increase in online discussions on abortion. I'm a redditor in the United States in a highly Catholic area. Like most of you, I'm a devout Catholic. However, unlike the majority of those on this subreddit, I'm a mother in my thirties who personally knows a large number of women who have had abortions who have been willing to discuss them with me.

Most women who have had abortions are not going to be vocally pro-choice. They are not going to show up at protests with signs. They are not going to talk about their experience. So I'm going to share just a few of the stories of the women I know so that you can better understand them and see why some of the ways that Catholics currently work to end abortion are useful methods, and why some of the current methods are actually harmful to our cause.

Our Catholic high schools have an unwritten policy, that girls will be expelled if they are pregnant. I personally know three girls who became pregnant at my high school. One of them had an abortion, two of them gave birth to their children.

The girl who had an abortion was seventeen and convinced that her parents would disown her and throw her out of the house if they found out she'd had sex. She would be kicked out of school and left on her own. Her boyfriend, the father of the child, would also be kicked out of his all boys' Catholic school if she kept the child. She opted to terminate her pregnancy by taking the abortion pill and never told her family. She graduated high school with honors. She's now married with children and a practicing Catholic.

One girl who kept her baby was sixteen. Her boyfriend at the time pressured her to have sex and then afterwards called her a whore. He graduated from high school. His parents paid child support on his behalf. She was expelled from school (previously she had been an honor student) and was able to get her GED several years later. She initially considered abortion, but decided against it and was confident that her family would support her decision to keep the child. Her Catholic family supported her and the child.

One girl became pregnant shortly before graduation. She had planned to keep her pregnancy a secret but the school found out due to her weight gain. She was allowed to graduate, but not to appear at the graduation ceremony. She and her boyfriend did not marry, but they are both involved in the child's life and she went on to attend college. She gave up scholarships to attend universities out of state to stay close to family for childcare.

In college a friend of mine had an abortion. She and her fianc√© had been engaged for several months and were planning their wedding in the Church. She found out he'd been cheating on her with a mutual friend shortly before finding out that she was pregnant with his child. He left her for the mutual friend and wanted nothing to do with either her or their child. As it was still very early in the pregnancy, and she was distraught at the idea of being a single mother with no support she chose to abort the child. Years later, I asked her how she felt about her decision and she told me that she regretted the potential life that had ended, but still felt that death was a better option than the life that she would have been able to provide the child. A single mother at age nineteen with no support from family. She'd have been kicked out of campus housing at our Catholic university. Homeless and saddled with large amounts of student debt with no degree and no way to afford childcare to work, she thought it was kinder to let the child die than to face the abuse she'd seen a childhood friend of hers face in the U.S. adoption and foster care system.

Last year another friend of mine had an abortion. Her baby died in the womb at 28 weeks. She and her husband were heartbroken. They had already begun decorating the nursery. The child had a name and was loved. The Catholic hospital she was at would not remove the baby, despite there being no heartbeat. They gave her a referral to a local clinic that performed abortions where the baby could be removed. Her alternative, which they advocated for, was to carry the stillborn baby to term risking sepsis and dealing with the trauma of continuing a non-viable pregnancy for months. It was a deeply traumatic event for her, to lose a much loved and wanted baby, made even harder by having to walk through a crowd of pro-life protestors holding signs with dead babies on them. I've seen posts advocating the use of these same signs here in [r/Catholicism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/) and I beg you to please reconsider. She felt so unloved and condemned by those protesting outside the clinic and by the indifference of those at the hospital, that she credits their actions in large part to why she has now left the Catholic Church.

A friend of mine has four beautiful children. The last one was born premature. Her water broke far too early and due to low amniotic fluid the doctors had to perform a c-section. Technically, taking the baby this early would be considered an abortion under several of the laws currently being voted on in our country. Her boy was born healthy, following a procedure that very well may be illegal next week. I implore you, when looking at legislation on this topic and especially when being involved with the committees supporting and drafting anti-abortion legislation to consider the unintended consequences of it. Please ask your bishops to always have doctors and OBGYNs review the legislation that they are supporting to make sure that the measures don't hurt children by having overly broad language put in place by those who don't understand medical terminology.

The last story I'll leave you with is my own. I have not had an abortion, but did seriously consider having one. I never imagined that I would be in such a position. When I was pregnant with my first child, the doctor asked my husband and I if we would want to have our baby tested for down syndrome or other trisomies. We decided that there was no reason to have the test done because no matter what we would not consider an abortion and would love our child. It ended up being a high risk pregnancy due undiagnosed health problems on my part so we started having frequent ultrasounds. In one of the ultrasounds they detected choroid plexus cysts on her brain. These can be indicative of Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18), and given the risk factors in play and the way the ultrasound looked they suggested we have an amniocentesis to test for it. They warned us that if the test came back positive that given the position of everything they could see on the ultrasound that she would likely not survive. For babies that test positive there is a 95% chance that they die in the womb. Of babies that live, half of them die within the first week. Even if she lived, she'd be in pain facing a horrible death.

The two days between that ultrasound and the test results were some of the longest of my life. Due to recent changes in state law, we would have only days after the test results came back to decide whether or not we were going to abort the baby or carry her to term. I honestly did not know what I would do, if I could survive months of carrying a baby with ""deformities incompatible with life"". Because of the way the law was written, I would not have enough time for opportunity to sit and think and pray on this with my husband and our priest, to consult with other doctors, to get a possible second opinion on whether or not there was any way our baby could be viable. The decision would have to be made very quickly. Even if our baby died in my womb, I would have to carry her body until I became septic and the hospital would then consider an abortion as a medical emergency procedure. Thank God, the test came back negative and I never had to make that decision. It was in that moment of deep helplessness up against an artificial legal deadline, that I felt profound empathy with so many of the women in the pro-choice movement that I have argued against. It shook me to my core to realize that so many of the laws I supported that I believed would only preserve the life of children, could also force mothers to carry children long dead to term.

A quote from a pro-life activist that often circulated in pro-choice circles is ""There is a tremendous sadness and loneliness in the cry 'A woman's right to choose.' No one wants an abortion as she wants an ice-cream cone or a Porsche. She wants an abortion as an animal, caught in a trap, wants to gnaw off its own leg.""

So I'm asking all of you to please show mercy and understanding when engaging on this topic. Yes, be passionate but also be compassionate. For so many women, it's not a question of ""is it a baby?"" but ""would my baby be better off dead than in the life that I could provide?"". Support counseling, support bishops and legislators working with medical professionals in drafting proposals, support material assistance for unwed mothers, for poor mothers, for women in crisis. So much of the pro-life message is directed at teens and young women without realizing that these shock images of dead babies will often polarize people away from the pro-life cause and deeply wound families who have experienced miscarriages. Despite our archbishops urging to simply stand and pray, there are still those who attend pro-life marches and protests to scream at those on the other side.

Abortions are not uncommon. If you do not know anyone who has had one, I'd ask you to ask yourself why they aren't talking to you about it. How can you make love and forgiveness the centerpiece of your activism for life?

With everything going on, sounds like you all need a feel good story. So here is mine.

About 3 weeks ago, my father suffered a brain stem stroke in front of the emergency department, while going to visit my mother who was just admitted that morning for internal bleeding. He was somehow able to drive to the hospital, park the car, turn off the ignition and come out of the car before he stumbled and fell. A Good Samaritan found him and he was admitted to the hospital with signs of stroke. So here I am, an only child, with both my parents in the hospital. F\*\*k me, right?

For almost 10 days my dad lay in the ICU. He was not progressing at all and was paralyzed on his right side. He was dependent on a ventilator, his blood pressure skyrocketed, he was put on insulin for his diabetes and was on an obscene amount of sedatives and pain killers. This man, who snuck me wine coolers before my high school dances, took lonely seniors on casino runs and never missed a birthday/graduation/holiday for any of his grandchildren was lying down in a hospital bed fighting for his life. The times he was barely conscious, he cried. This is a man, in all my 44 years of life, has never cried.

His physician, at the time had written him off as being someone with a very 'low quality of life'. My father, an extremely vibrant man with a big mouth and an equally big heart, would likely never walk again and since he was not progressing, my mother and I made the very difficult decision to withdraw care in 48 hours. This was the most heartbreaking decision that I ever had to make. My kids saw me in the worst state of my life. My puppy (7 month old shihpoo) let me ugly cry into his fur. It was the worst week of my life.

Fast forward 48 hours later. My mom and I went to say our final goodbyes to my dad. We ran into our priest in the hospital who had just blessed my dad the day before (as we jokingly said that the only way to get him to be catholic was for him to be on his death bed). He mentioned how alert my father was. When we walked in to his room, the nurse said that he was watching TV. I mean, WTF, how is this man, who was in a vegetable state like 48 hours ago, watching T.V? We walked in to find my dad fully awake, off all sedatives, able to squeeze our hands and able to communicate by nodding his head. This was certainly NOT a man who was ready to die. The nurse then explained that he had progressed in the past 24 hours and that we could 'change our mind' with withdrawing end of care. We asked my dad if he was willing to try getting off the ventilator. We asked him if he was willing to fight the long battle ahead. He nodded yes, and squeezed out hand. I have since reported the doctor that told us that my father had no quality of life as she did not update us on our progress, and I can't help to think if they would have continued the end of life process had we not been able to visit him that day.

It's been two weeks since that life changing day in the ICU. My father has been progressing really well, able to fully move his left arm and leg, and occasionally, will stick his middle finger up at me and the nurse so at least we know he still has his sense off humour. He is completely off the ventilator and is undergoing physiotherapy. The doctors are amazed at his progress, stating that patients with his prognosis do not recover that quickly or, recover at all for that matter.

We are not sure what the future holds for my father, but I am so grateful that he is alive. And to see him flip the bird to me, is priceless.",Catholicism,"We were going to take my dad off life support, but God had other plans- Your feel good 'miracles' do happen true story for the day",1007.0,0.98

I am a Convert to Catholicism; I was raised protestant (Non-Denominational) up until Highschool until I met my girlfriend (now fiancee!) my senior year who was Catholic. I would occasionally go to Mass with her family but I didn't really understand it and I wasn't a huge fan at first, but I still believed in God. My fiancee would pray for my conversion to Catholicism because she really wanted to get married in the church. A little over a year ago she went to NCYC and she prayed for my conversion more than ever and wasn't sure if we would stay together since I wasn't Catholic. Well I would end up stumbling across a documentary about Pope John Paul II on youtube while she was on her trip, and I became very inspired by his story. This led me to delve deeper into the faith and when she came back and I told her that we should watch the JPII documentary together and she was basically in tears. She knew her prayers had been answered, and soon after I would start RCIA and pick up a Catholic Bible. I would end up finishing the Bible a couple months before RCIA ended (I love scripture!) Which inspired me to pick St. Paul as my confirmation saint (Also my middle name is John, so having John Paul in my full name is a reminder of Pope John Paul II!) I just got confirmed and recieved holy communion for the first time today. I never really post on Reddit, but reading all the stuff you would post here helped me understand the faith better. The Catholic Church has helped me become much more involved in the Christian faith. Thank you all for helping me out on my journey and I hope my story inspires some Protestants who were on the fence about joining Catholicism like I was. Thanks be to God!

But after lurking here without an account for half a year since I myself leave protestantism and marrying an agnostic husband (almost atheists as he one day told me that God for him  was at the same level of table manners -subjective for a better explanation-). Since November i started praying the rosary with an app. Everynight. Before i tried to debate with him. To explain misunderstandings as I myself had answers in the process to. Inviting him to pray with me. To pray for me at least. So i stopped pushing and making the effort myself, alone.

Instead I asked Mary to intercede for him. To help him guide my husband to her Son. One night my mother in law wich is catholic and thinks i am still protestant send me a message thanking me to making his son a believer.

I disnt understood at first. She told me that at least he is in a church reading the bible. And i told her : I am praying every night the rosary so God can gave him the need to seek him.

It made her so happy. She told me my husband in a call early that morning tried to share a gospel message (weird because my husband does not read the bible never pays atrention to the sermon at the protestant church we used to go).

And that he used words such as ""is in God hands, I know (FIL) is with bad health and i cant stop the day hes gone but hope you both are in the right path before God"".


Some might say that he talked like that because he repect her mom beliefes. But the truth is that my husband used to mock her and brag about marrying a satanist in order to go away further from the faith. Sometimes i would sense my Husband anger of calling God father because for him a father was an actual figure to bond with not an abstract idea.


That same night he himself told me; lets pray. I still domt have enough faith. But I want to pray for you and to having childs.


I am so grateful. Theres a big step that God allowed him to do. I will keep my prayings. Thanks for the users as well who recommended study links too in other posts.

I'm posting here because I don't know where else to go or who to talk to. Any rationality I have is out of shock.

I was the one who found him two hours ago, outside on the front porch. He still had grocery bags in his hands. The eggs he had gone out to buy for his anniversary morning pancakes were all cracked on the ground with yolk spilling out. I screamed for help and started Cpr but even then i knew he was dead.

My mother is functionless, and she can't get up from her bed. She can't speak or process anything. And i have a feeling its going to stay this way. I have six brothers, the oldest of whom has special needs and is not emotionally capable of leading us all. All my family lives in Vietnam, my mother's friends are in different towns, and the only person we have was  the priest who came by. He left 10 minutes ago. 

i'm angry because I just turned 15 and I know that my childhood is over. I'm scared because I don't know how to access financial benefits and the sort. i'm numb because my father is dead, and the thing I'm just so so sad about right now is the fact that he never saw my anniversary gift of a  drawing of him and my mom. And now I don't know what to do with it.

 My 2 younger brothers are all asleep and they don't know yet.  I'm going to have to be the big sister and do that. The other three are crying downstairs. My older brother went storming out the door and I dont know where he is. And I can hear my mom in the next room. 

Please pray for my family and my strength as a leader. I think that financially we will be fine due to insurance and savings in the past, but there will be sacrifice. This has completely shattered everything in our life. Pray for my dad. I love him so so much and he knows that he can rely on me to take care of us.

I grew up in a rather conservative Baptist tradition and unfortunately my parents are very anti-Catholic. I haven‚Äôt told anyone but one of my sisters and one of my brothers (I have many siblings) and I don‚Äôt look forward to telling my parents (it‚Äôs probably gonna be a while before I do). I‚Äôve been studying Catholic theology for some time at first trying to refute it and then eventually just trying to understand it. Recently I have begun to find it very very hard to refute and I think the next big step is to convert. Unfortunately the situation with my parents isn‚Äôt going to be fun. They both have strong emotional disdain for Catholicism and doctrinal objections largely based on their false perceptions of what the Catholic Church teaches. All I can do is stress that this has been a purely intellectual journey for me but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna help anything. I could use prayer for that, honestly. Also, this is probably going to severely damage my social life and may ruin friendships, but it‚Äôs worth it to me if it means I get to be a part of the one, true, holy, apostolic, and Catholic Church. 

I am going to keep my plans to convert secret for the time being (I‚Äôll have to do RCIA but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need to be baptized since I have already been baptized with the Trinitarian formula) but I‚Äôm gonna convert as soon as I move out and then try to break it to my parents lightly.

QuackNagy,0.0,880.0,"My girlfriend has been attending mass, reading spiritual and theological books and asking big questions for months now. We started Catechism for RCIA in August. Although it has been a prominent part of our lives, it has had to stay under wraps until recently (her parents were raised Catholic, saw the ""truth"" and became protestants and are very anti-Catholic). Once her parents got the idea that she might be changing camps, they asked ""are you converting?"" To which she said ""yes"". Praise God!

They brought in their Bible study leader who is a learned, charismatic and kind man, who is anti-Catholic but fair. He asked me questions that required some unpopular answers, which was admittedly difficult, i.e. ""So you believe the Catholic Church is the one true Church, and all others are false?"" and then pressed on to the Pope, the political side of the church, the apparently confounding Marian doctrines and the embarrassing side of the history of individuals within the Church. I noticed that everything on the Protestant side that needed explanation boiled down to presuppositions and ""that's the wrong interpretation"". Aside from these, it was a lovely and polite evening.

People, know your faith! Be ready to defend it! If I were a less stubborn man, or had I met with these challenges earlier in life, I could have folded. 

But all in all, we defended ourselves well, and only left that exhausting chat with more zeal and desire to know the faith, Holy Scripture and the Church. I don't think her parents were expecting much of a decent rebuttal and, while they would probably see that they came out on top last night, they could see that we weren't interested in coming out on top, and that there was a certainty and obedience in their daughter that they had missed out on.

ThomasDowd_ca,0.0,875.0,"I've been noticing a trend in a lot of posts on this forum, when people ask questions (or offer answers) in moral issues. Someone will, for example, put forward a moral scenario, and then ask ""Is this a mortal sin"" or ""did I commit a mortal sin"". Or, someone might say ""that action is a mortal sin"" or (worse) ""you committed a mortal sin"".

As a pastor of souls, I think we need to be really careful about the use of the term ""mortal sin"". It is almost impossible to say if this or that sin was actually mortal because for a sin to be mortal there must be an objective component (called ""grave matter"") and a subjective component (a high degree of knowledge and consent). As you can imagine, measuring the subjective element is extraordinarily difficult, even for the person who committed the sin.

People often seem to use the term ""mortal sin"" to refer to grave matter only (for example, if someone asks ""Is abortion a mortal sin?"") The term is being used imprecisely. Abortion is grave matter, for sure, and therefore is part of the raw material for mortal sin, but one cannot call a category of action ""mortal sin"". The correct question is ""Is abortion grave matter for sin"" or ""Is abortion gravely sinful"", something along those lines.

It is generally much easier to see if the action involved grave matter, as that is the objective component and easier to measure. It is also possible (and even pastorally wise) to warn people who are committing sins involving grave matter that their souls are in peril, and to invite them to repent. But to go so far as to say ""that particular sin was mortal"" is going too far, especially given the limits of the medium we have here. I don't think we want to trigger people in their scrupulosity, or (worse) possibly lead them to despair.

I write this because I've noticed a real desire for moral goodness (and moral guidance) in this forum, and it impresses me. However, it is hard for me, as a pastor of souls, to answer an imprecise question. I also don't have the time, personally, to police the giving of imprecise answers. So I offer this observation to the community so that we can better support one another.",Catholicism,"We need to be careful using the term ""mortal sin""",875.0,0.96

Yet all throughout the various sects of protestantism, you'll see affirmation of homosexuality, abortion, masturbation, injustice, etc. To be fair, there are some conservative Protestant denominations who do affirm the objective morality taught in scripture, and they should be commended. 

But, my own personal experience as a Protestant with a 'me and Jesus' attitude toward Christianity was to end up lost at sea and latching on to ideologies that contradicted scripture because, well, I was my own personal interpreter. I want to say that I truly appreciate the deep commitment to Biblical morality that the Catholic Church has taught for centuries.

Early this morning, we hit 100k subscribers! What an incredible milestone! We have grown so quickly, it almost snuck up on us. I can't believe that in just my two short years as moderator, the subreddit has *more than doubled* in the number of subscribers. 

Of course, none of this would be possible without you all. I think I speak for all the moderator team when I say that we appreciate all of you and your contributions. This subreddit wouldn't be half as great of a community without all your comments, posts, and input. So for that, we thank you all!

As we continue to grow, we hope to become an even better community for Catholics, as a place where we can all grow in faith together, and attract others to the Church. There are a few things we as a moderator team have been thinking about to better serve and direct the community, which we hope to share soon. In the meantime, we hope you'll take this opportunity to reflect a little on where we've come from and where we're going. Let's all think about the mission of this subreddit and help everyone who uses it to have a wonderful experience. 

Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to another 100k joining us, and many years ahead!

It wasnt going to be normal, but we would get to confess, participate in communion and confirm. Last night we found out that we won't be doing those things until we can have public Masses. 

If you follow my posts you know I was a Southern Baptist pastor. That I have essentially sacrificed my family's love and most of my friendships to become Catholic. I'm sure this is hard for every waiting convert. As someone who was raised that family and friends were everything, I have become a man with nothing save Christ and His Church

ComfortableYogurts,0.0,771.0,"My wife and I decided two years ago that we wanted to start having children. Around that time, we also decided to join the Catholic Church. After a year of no success, we were devastated. All of our siblings and friends were having children around us and it was almost impossible to be happy for them because we were just reminded of our own pain. 

We decided my wife should see a fertility counselor, which went on for another year. The doctor said it was totally unexplained. Again, no success and the sadness became unbearable. Things would get better halfway through each month, and then we‚Äôd get the news that she wasn‚Äôt pregnant, and we‚Äôd break down again. Some of our friends were so kind, others were rather callous and didn‚Äôt understand the pain of the situation. We prayed to God every night, and also prayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Gerard, and Blessed Margaret, but one night we didn‚Äôt pray and we never picked up the habit again. 

Both of us became very jaded. I became emotionally vacant after watching my wife whimper on the couch nightly for a week at a time. She started to doubt God‚Äôs existence, or at the very least his interest in interacting us. Only those who have dealt with this or are close to someone who has dealt with this understand how horrible this experience can be and why those suffering it react the way they do. Research has found that women in particular can suffer PTSD due to infertility. 

The holiday season was coming up and we were (rather unsuccessfully) preparing to deal with seeing our nieces, nephews, and children of friends. Again, we were never unhappy that those around us had children, but they did remind us of what we couldn‚Äôt have. The Monday before Thanksgiving, I was getting ready for work. I was in a very sour mood because the the previous night my wife said she felt her cramps coming on and we both wept for a long time. She walked into the room crying that morning, which somewhat triggered me. I turned around and she was holding a positive pregnancy test. I couldn‚Äôt believe it.

She‚Äôs been to the doctor since. She‚Äôs 10 weeks along now and our baby has a very, very strong heartbeat. Part of me still can‚Äôt believe it, another part of me feels some shame because I wrote God off for the last 10 months yet he still blessed us. Another part of me is overjoyed, but I‚Äôm too scared to totally feel it because I wonder if this is too good to be true and something bad will happen. Either way, I wanted to share my story with you guys and give glory to God despite our lack of faith throughout this ordeal.

I'm not sure if they are printing new Bibles with this or printing it in a school textbooks only, I think this is about textbooks, but they have changed the Gospel, they are teaching that Jesus stoned the woman to death !! instead of what we know that He stopped her being stoned and let her go to sin no more.

AloneBowl,0.0,744.0,"Hello r/Catholicism, some of you may remember me from 2 years ago although I'm sure most of you don't. I used this throwaway exclusively for expressing my deep marital troubles and asking for prayer support from the faithful members of this sub. The entire story is way too long to post, but feel free to look at my post history to get a glimpse into that time two years ago.

I'm back to give you all an update because I think you deserve it. Everyone on this sub was so kind to me and offered me so much love and prayer during my ""dark night of the soul"". I'm going to apologize in advance because I'm sure this is going to be long; a lot has transpired since my last post. I'll do my best to summarize though.

For a while things got worse, and worse and living with my spouse was becoming unbearable. I loved him so much and he just kept pulling further and further away from me. One day I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't keep fighting against it. I felt so lost and hopeless and like God had abandoned me in my deepest need. I was clinging to the Blessed Virgin. On this particular day I prayed ""Mother, I can't keep doing this. I don't want to give up on my marriage but I also don't want to keep fighting for something that God hasn't meant for me. I need to know what I'm supposed to do. If I'm meant to keep praying and hoping to save my family I will, but if I'm meant to accept that this is God's will and start praying to get through all of this I will do that to. Please, send me a sign, but Mother, it has to be clear. It has to smack me in the face because if it's anything less I'll convince myself I imagined it."" Afterwards I prayed the rosary and left it in her hands. Later that day I started to get myself ready for mass and as I bent to get my hair curler from below the sink something flew out of the cabinet and literally hit me in the face. When I went to see what had just attacked me I saw that it was an engagement photo of my husband and I (I have no explanation for how or why that photo was in there). ""Okay, Mom. I read you loud and clear"" I promised Our Lady that because she gave me this sign I would pray for our marriage up until the moment when I received an annulment.

I had a clear hope to cling to and I took absolutely everything to the Blessed Mother and asked for her to intercede for me; reminding her of the Wedding Feast at Cana and that perhaps the only reason I would receive a miracle was because she asked it of Our Lord. However, things didn't look up. My husband moved out of our house later that month and I was in utter despair and desperation as we continued to move through the divorce process. I kept my promise to pray for my marriage but it didn't seem to be helping.

As sad and alone as I was soon separation became my ""new normal"". We co-parented well and got along okay but there was still so much pain. I was still so in love with him and we were still each others best friend. I tried seeing someone else but it made my hurt worse. I kept praying for our marriage but in October of 2019 we signed the final divorce papers and I began the process of annulment. I often wondered how I had gotten it so wrong. How on earth had I misinterpreted that sign? Feeling much less optimistic I continued to pray for our marriage because I promised Our Lady I would.

Jumping ahead to December of 2019 my (now ex) husband came to me crying that he missed me, he missed our family, he had made so many mistakes, etc. I was hopeful but cautious. I immediately made my priest aware of the situation and sought his council and advice. He was so helpful to me and understanding of my situation (he himself coming from divorced parents). Eventually I halted the annulment process for the time being.

We went through a lot of turmoil trying to reconcile and heal and trust each other. It was hard and somedays seemed absolutely impossible. Then the quarantine happened and we agreed that it would be best for my husband to come be quarantined at my house so that he could still see our daughter. I thought this time would make or break us. We went through so much external stress during that time (as was the rest of the world, I know). Lots of ups and downs, but one night we laid it all out on the table. Everything we'd done in the separation that we had been avoiding talking about, all our feelings, hopes, and needs and from that point everything completely shifted.

From that night onward our relationship became totally different. We were our old selves but better. Our communication is 1000x's better, we both sought treatment for mental health and physical health issues, we became more accepting and mature. We are now 6 months from that point and things have never been better. We just recently told our family members that we have reconciled and everyone on both sides is over joyed!

I just wanted to publicly thank Jesus for his tender Mercy to our family, Our Lady whom I give full credit to in getting us here and helping me maintain my hope, sanity, and faith in a time where I had every reason to lose all three, to the communion of saints whom I called on for so much help, and to everyone (especially this community) who offered prayers for us. Miracles do happen!

May anyone who is in pain or despair right now surrender themselves to the love of Jesus and Mary. God bless and keep you all, and have a Merry Christmas.",Catholicism,My Marriage is in Jeopardy: Update,744.0,0.99

Lashing out at those who had an abortion/pro-choicers will not do anything at all; it will only make them despise the pro life movement even more.

Instead, we need to use scientific facts, reveal how disgusting abortion is (show pictures of abortion babies to reveal the truth behind abortion) but most importantly: 

Offer love and forgiveness.

Forgiveness shows compassion, and it is definitely a very effective way of convincing pro choicers to change their minds. Forgiving is also integral in our catholic faith so we should forgive and offer kindness no matter now abhorrent the sin is.

Then came communion and I‚Äôll never forget this moment. I watched him give communion with complete reverence and so meaningfully.

My (Catholic) mother gave me up for adoption when she was 20. I'm so grateful that she gave me the chance to exist here on Earth. Because of her heart-wrenching choice, I'm here, I'm married, we have three beautiful children so far. Just think of the many generations that will exist one day as a result of that one choice that my mom made. 

It hurts my heart when people justify abortion by saying that they could never allow their child to go through the difficulties of being adopted. It hurts my heart when people who are suffering from infertility have ""Why don't you just adopt"" listed as one of the top ten things we aren't allowed to say to them. The mere suggestion of adopting a child who needs a home is offensive to them, but making human lives in a lab, selecting them for sex and/or perceived defects, sticking them in a freezer or destroying them is fine.

Okay, well, I'm writing this because I feel like letting off steam before it clouds my mind, and erupts my soul. Essentially, it's been breaking me a lot lately because both of my sisters are pregnant and in loving relationships. It's so painful looking at them: normal human beings living a normal life. Why am I this way? I feel like such an anomaly, an odious being, a load of steak not fully cooked, even when I know I am none of that. Today, at church, I also saw a couple with their kids, all holding hands during the Our Father, and it shattered me: I really want that, but it's not possible because of how I am. I want to get married, have a bunch of children, and build a home with them, but what I want can never be because these disordered passions imprison me.  I don't mind being Celibate, because I know how shallow a gay lifestyle can get (trust me, it's just lust, barely room for love.) Even if there was no instituted celibacy policy for gay people, I'd still be celibate, 'cause the gay life-style made me utterly miserable. There's a comfort and beauty in celibacy that is hard to explain, it's like fasting but better. No problem with celibacy, it's just so weird how forgotten we gay Catholics are.

Victims were two women one aged 30 years old, an other aged 70 years old and a man, a sacristan, aged 45 years old.

This took place in the basilique.

I am crying but I am going to church later today to pray.

sethn61,0.0,681.0,"Okay so, I used to be in the LGBT community, identified as bisexual for quite some time, and I suffered debilitating gender dysphoria for a while and attempted a gender transition at 19. My late teenage life was defined by all this.

Long story short I abandoned that life to persue Christianity because I cared more about the truth no matter the personal cost and because I had good friends who had the nerve to ask me what I was living for and slowly opened the door to Christ, and I eventually discovered the Catholic Church had the fullness of him. As of writing this I am now Baptized, Confirmed and Communed.

That life change happened about 20 months ago, I recently had a conversation with my close friend and she believes that this whole thing is a crutch. That all of my devotion is just a coping mechanism.

""You changed your entire view points so quick and who you were when you became religious. 
It's like, you were scared to not have something there for you. 
You've made your religion your personality and it's so strange, 
You went upside down when you chose your religion and it just wasn't a you thing to do"". 

For further context, I approached the faith with extreme reservation, and for a while I didn't want it to be true, it was only after seeing all the arguments, being treated with unconditional love from Christians who really believed that I opened my heart to God, and that took longer than 6 months.

I mentioned that I abandoned any LGBT label because I believe they are demeaning and reductive and her response was 'You stopped identifying with who you are  when you delve into religion'. I was taken aback but she completely believes this.

She is convinced that, if only I opened myself up to positive sexual exploration, and spent my 20's hooking up, trying drugs, having little moral standards other than 'I'm young so this is the time to experiment', that I will be happier.

I fully intend to travel, go to parties, and self explore for the next decade onwards, but I'm not going to neglect God to do that.

I think half of the trouble is just that the faith is confusing to outsiders and I end up being the ambassador because nobody cares to research.

She also made the strange argument that when I have children I should be able to have had the experience with that life so I can warn my kids properly about it and that point almost gave me a nose bleed.

""I just wish, you gave yourself more, instead of trans to religious in like a year :/""

I understand that I'm going to take years to stabilize as a Christian and as a person, but I'm starting to get really concerned my lifelong friends could become a hurdle for me. 

Not sure what to do :/

I don't have anything against, I just feel like these types of churches are obviously more welcoming and easily accessible to people. Catholicism is obviously a lot more intimidating to most prospective converts, largely because the theocracy is so deep and the traditions and structure trace all the way back to the 12 apostles in the book of acts.

Astrolys,0.0,662.0,"Today, at the invitation from a fellow french classmate, I attended a normal Mass just for the purpose of attending it.

I've been living in Poland for a few months now as part of my Erasmus year and a fellow classmate I met during online courses proposed me to see a Mass held in French in Krak√≥w.

&amp;#x200B;

I had not attended a normal mass in a long time (except religious ceremonies like a few marriages, funerals and see the first communion of a family member). Actually, I hadn't attended any Mass since shortly after my confirmation, about 7 years ago I think ? I had quickly lost faith in the existence of (a) God and started believing in Atheism. But in the past couple of years, I went through a dark period of my life, I was depressed and I started putting in question my faith in Atheism\*. I went through some kind of spiritualist ideas and stuff, and slowly started seeing something that now feel obvious, something that always felt true even when I denied it, something that I always came back to in some ways: My faith in God and Jesus Christ.

It's been a few months, perhaps more than a year since I stopped lying to myself on this matter and the morals I embraced with my renewed faith helped me go through this depressed part of me, but also thanks to new friends I made.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I felt uneasy going to church. I had forgotten pretty much everything on How2Jesus, except the absolute fundamentals (Hail Mary and Our Father, basic things, etc). I even forgot most the Bible and stuff. I bought myself a New Testament quite recently (but I forgot it back home in France.....) and I'm still quite lost.

I also felt uneasy with the Church itself as a whole. I have strong political convictions that are (or seem) more than often in contradiction with the Church's political stances. I'm simply going to say I'm quite strongly left leaning (in the European sense of leftist ofc) in hope of not setting the comment section ablaze. Even though my beliefs contradict the Church's, I do not feel like they're wrong or contradict my faith. I would be what my classmate call a ""Red Christian"".

&amp;#x200B;

And despite all that, my classmate, even though I barely knew her invited me and helped me all along the ceremony. And that felt very good, and very right. Something that seems inherently nice and happy. I was quite lost but still, saying those few phrases in public, this prayers in this sacred house of God, and those songs... really, all of that put my soul at ease somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to ask you now, how can I improve my practice of my faith ? I would need any help you may kindly give me.

&amp;#x200B;

Peace on you all.

&amp;#x200B;

NB: \* I said ""faith in Atheism"" because I strongly agree that there is no proof of the existence of God, nor there is proof of is non-existence.

moodybiatch,0.0,659.0,"I was born and raised in Italy, where Catholicism is still going quite strong compared to others countries and many parents still send their kids to religious education groups, called ""catechesi"". After many years and some personal spiritual changes, I now consider myself an atheist, but still retain most, if not all the values that I have been taught in my religious education, so I wanted to share this with you.

Most of my fellow atheists give me dirty looks when I say I'm proud I've walked this path, assuming that I've been indoctrinated with homophobic or racist values, some think it was a political thing and my parents must vote for a right wing party because they are Christians, some even call them out for child abuse saying that they took my religious freedom away from me. I guess many people see that type of education as if it had some sort of army training level of discipline, without really knowing what's behind it.

""Catechesi"" was not army training or indoctrination, it was a safe place for kids to go to after school, one hour per week, to learn about moral values together with other kids, play, have fun, and be guided in our christian path by two lovely ladies that I would put among the sweetest people I've met in my life. They never told us that homosexuality is a sin, they never told us that Muslims are bad. Instead they taught us to love each other and every human being as we love ourselves, to be forgiving and caring, to help those in need and not be greedy. All values that every kid should be taught in my opinion, but many parents and teachers will not directly address. 

We had summer camps and Saturday afternoon activities to get the kids to play together, we rented the football field of the neighborhood and I remember some Muslim kids were always there and were very much welcome to play with us, and in the evening they often joined us for dinner and even the priest himself wouldn't flinch if they didn't pray with us before eating.

When we were old enough we even had an ""emotional education group"" where we got taught how to deal with the hormonal changes we were going through (early teens), how to have healthy relationships and how to respect and value our (and other people's) bodies. No one told us ""if you have sex before marriage you're gonna go to hell"", they instead taught us not to rush into relationships, and that our sexuality was something that should have been dear to us and was not worth wasting on someone we were not ready to do it with. And something that I EXTREMELY appreciate now as an adult, was that they not only told us to respect ourselves, but to respect others as well. We talked about consent, and about not taking advantage of people, and I believe that was a huge thing back in the days, since we always assume kids will grow up knowing what's right and what's wrong, but we hardly ever explicitly tell them. 

So this is my personal experience with Catholic education, and I can't say anything but positive things about it. I hope everyone can have such a good experience, and I wish something like this could be put un every child's path, either in a religious or non religious manner. And hopefully this is going to lift a bit of that stereotype that is very popular among atheists today, that Christians are all racist bigots stuck in their ways and that Christian values are all based on hate and strict interpretation of the Bible.

Edit: I really appreciate the support I have received from this community, and how understanding everyone is being even though we might not share the same beliefs. Since some of you are trying to talk about my beliefs, either to try and talk me into considering becoming a Christian again or simply because they might be interested in this type of discussion, I kindly ask to not do it on this post.

The story of the comments can be found [here.](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-calls-for-civil-union-law-for-same-sex-couples-in-shift-from-vatican-stance-12462) All other comments and posts should be directed here.

To briefly summarize: 

&gt;In a documentary that premiered Wednesday in Rome, Pope Francis called for the passage of civil union laws for same-sex couples, departing from the position of the Vatican‚Äôs doctrinal office and the pope‚Äôs predecessors on the issue.

&gt;The remarks came amid a portion of the documentary that reflected on pastoral care for those who identify as LGBT. 

&gt;‚ÄúHomosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They‚Äôre children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it,‚Äù Pope Francis said in the film, of his approach to pastoral care.

&gt;After those remarks, and in comments likely to spark controversy among Catholics, Pope Francis weighed in directly on the issue of civil unions for same-sex couples.

&gt;‚ÄúWhat we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered,‚Äù the pope said. ‚ÄúI stood up for that.‚Äù

&gt;The remarks come in ‚ÄúFrancesco,‚Äù a documentary on the life and ministry of Pope Francis which premiered Oct. 21 as part of the Rome Film Festival, and is set to make its North American premiere on Sunday.

This movie hasn't made it's way to North America, so we don't know the context of these comments, or how they might have been edited (either deceptively or not). It may be best to wait until this movie is shown to make a judgement, or to see the response of the Holy See on this matter.

My exes either turned out to be against Catholicism or one was Latin Catholic but was a cafeteria Catholic and tried to pick and choose what he would follow. Still when I meet someone who was evangelical, something told me to pursue it.

We were very clear from the start that I was staying Catholic and our kids would be Catholic. We met with a deacon who is married to a non-Catholic shortly after we got engaged. He gave us the advice for fianc√© to take RCIA but it wasn‚Äôt the right time to sign up.

Well after trying a few times to attend mass and service at his church on the same Sunday as well as taking all the Catholic marriage prep classes, he decided to take RCIA.

Due to covid his class meets biweekly instead of weekly and they have videos to watch on the off weeks. We decided it would be better if he had a sponsor that could guide him in raising kids Catholic and answer deeper theological questions. I was raised Catholic by a single mother who is no longer practicing so I didn‚Äôt feel like I was the best guide for him.  I‚Äôve also had concussions since being confirmed and the information is somewhere in my brain but doesn‚Äôt come out very well (I can only remember prayers I have memorized half the time with the written text in front of me) so he needed someone he can talk to on a deep level.

Every time he comes to see me from class he is excited about what he learned and was thrilled when he got his own Rosary so he didn‚Äôt have to borrow one of mine when we pray. He told me last week that they asked in class who was highly considering becoming Catholic and he was one of the people who raised his hand.

His 2 biggest questions have been addressed to some extent in his RCIA classes. 

He won‚Äôt be Catholic by our December wedding but things look hopeful that he will be before we have our first child and I‚Äôm just so excited.

I need to get better about being a practicing Catholic but I‚Äôm so excited my love will most likely be joining in being Catholic. He was supportive as an evangelical, I feel he will be even more so as a Catholic.

j4242,0.0,625.0,"This post is long-winded and sort of a mess organizationally, so I apologize in advance. I just felt that I needed to put this out there. 

My story is kind of a long one so to spare you the verbosity **the tl;dr is this: I was raised as an evangelical (protestant) Christian and was fairly religious but always had a peculiar attraction to Catholicism, I became an atheist in my early 20s, and now, at 24, I have a deep desire to have a relationship with Jesus Christ, and feel the Catholic Church is the one he founded. All the same, I still have episodes of doubt and fear that undermine the strength of my faith.**

I‚Äôm a 24yo man, recently graduated college and I‚Äôm having what you might as well call a quarter-life crisis. For most of my life, I‚Äôve dealt with depression, which, in the past year, has really exceeded a manageable level. At the risk of sounding histrionic or making this post sound attention-hungry, I struggle with loneliness, isolation (as many are right now during the pandemic) and this past summer, I attempted suicide. 

I‚Äôve been desperate to derive some kind of meaningful vocation out of this life. In the advent of my post-college years, I‚Äôve struggled to find a job, and work a job that I hate. I don‚Äôt have any social life whatsoever. 

While both my parents were raised and christened in the Catholic Church, they raised my sister and I in a series of evangelical churches we drifted through throughout my childhood‚Äîteenage years. I had a very strong Christian upbringing, and was well-versed in the Bible at a young age (I don‚Äôt say that to come across as self-aggrandizing or arrogant, just to provide context). 

The church we went to throughout my time in high school coincided with the happiest times of my life: while I always legitimately believed in the supernatural reality of God, Christ, the Trinity, and eternal life, my spiritual life *really* bloomed during this period. I became very close with the people at my church, and got very involved in my youth group, worship team, and volunteered in various capacities. 

Most significantly, however,  my faith became the strongest at this time. I prayed and worshipped God in the most earnest and disciplined capacity I could, not just in Church but all the time. I read the Bible. I prayed ‚Äúwithout ceasing,‚Äù as 1 Thessalonians commands, and often felt as though the Holy Spirit spoke to me.

Long story short, after high school, my family left our church while i was away at college, without telling me, and that hurt a lot. Eventually, we stopped going to church altogether, and now are really not religious at all. Eventually, through college, while I didn‚Äôt lead a dramatically sinful life, my belief in God eroded and eventually disappeared. I was an atheist. I had no desire for chruch, or any spiritual dimension to life whatsoever, for that matter. 

Fast forward to a few weeks before this past Christmas. For some reason, I‚Äôd been starting to read/watch a lot of videos about the RC church. This was something I did a lot throughout my life; despite being Protestant, I had a very specific, persistent, curiosity regarding Catholicism. Years ago, I‚Äôd go through phases where I‚Äôd watch documentaries, read articles, etc., about the Church. I was really interested in Rennaissance art as a middle schooler, and devoured books on Rome, Michelangelo, Raphael, Julius Ii, the Medicis, etc. Every time, I got a special...i don‚Äôt know...feeling looking at those gorgeous paintings, churches and sculptures. 

One day, maybe a week before Christmas, while really struggling with loneliness (though I still live with my parents) I happened to look at our nativity we set up in our house every year. I looked at the Christ child‚Äôs face (I‚Äôm kind of getting choked up now as I‚Äôm typing this lol) and felt, extremely clearly, that I missed Him and His presence in Christmas. 

My researching then intensified. I broke out a copy of C.S. Lewis‚Äô *Mere Christianity.* I started watching tons of Catholic contect on YouTube (Ascension Presents, Breaking the Habit, etc.) and listening to Gregorian chants and watching Masses, both Novus Ordo and Latin Masses. Through all this, I‚Äôd get an immense amount of comfort and peace immersing myself in Catholic literature and content. 

And now here I am. I think I want to be Catholic. I pray every day now. Prayer helps me abstain from indulging in a lot of sinful behavior, it gives me peace. I‚Äôve stopped drinking heavily. My depression has markedly improved, although I still have bad days. Even though I can‚Äôt recieve the Eucharist (yet) I ask God to help me discipline myself every day, amd I ask the Virgin Mary to pray for me. 

There are still some problems though. **First,** I still have doubts. I have episodes where I question the validity of God‚Äôs existence. Despite this‚Äîand I cannot overstate this‚ÄîI WANT Christ and the Father to be real. I WANT all of this to be true. I now have so much respect for the Church, amd how it has postively impacted the world. It‚Äôs so beautiful. I WANT to recieve Him and have an intimate relationship with my Lord and Father in Heaven, yet I feel guilty when my faith falters. 

**Second,** I feel very uncomfortable talking to my family about this. I don‚Äôt know what kind of a reaction they‚Äôll have. In partculalr, I‚Äôm afraid my mom, who was always the most devout, will see my rejection of our Protestantism as her failing and/or a repudiation of her on my behalf. 

Should I talk to a priest? What should I do next? Does God accept my prayers even though I haven‚Äôt fully converted yet? 

Any advice and/or feedback would be greatly appreciated. God bless you all. Please pray for me.",Catholicism,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm typing this, but I think I feel called to join the Catholic Church.",625.0,0.97

michael_schwartz,0.0,617.0,"Hi. I want to share a little recent experience. It sounds incredible, and I would be the first one to be skeptic about it if I read it online. But I'm so surprised that I want to tell the world.

I'm a young lawyer and I had a trial assigned for this morning. The trial would be about an eviction, and I foresaw I could do very little to help my soon-to be evicted client. I knew I would be in a difficult and uncomfortable situation before a rude judge, in which I would probably have almost nothing to say. 

Knowing all of this, yesterday, when going to bed I had an idea: There must be some lawyers in purgatory that can give me a couple of ideas and help me be calm during the trial, right? I could ask them for help. They say souls in purgatory help us. So I took my rosary in my hand, shook it and half-seriously half-jokingly jokingly said. ""Hey, souls in purgatory. I have to face this situation. If there's someone (specially some lawyer) who wants to help me, look at what I have here!"". Then, I half-laughed and fell asleep.

But what a surprise awaited me. I was awoken in the middle of the night by a very persistent noise: some knocking followed by a squeak, in a very regular rhythm, until I got completely awake. It stopped there. It had come from the flat immediately above mine. And then I remembered there's no neighbour living there. It's empty. Completely empty. I was (and still am) absolutely convinced that the knocking was an ""acknowledgment of receipt"".

I had no fear at all. I was even happy. I didn't expect that at all. Since I was completely awake in the middle of the night, I decided to pray a little bit. Just 5 minutes. And I felt a clear spiritual consolation. I went to bed again and fell asleep again.

So today I had my trial. I had a couple of new ideas before it started, and I clearly knew what I had to say. I spoke calmly, and everything went fast, clean and nice. Even another lawyer congratulated me.

And now, I'm spending my day fulfilling my part of the deal: praying the rosary for that soul who helped me.",Catholicism,Purgatory must be true... (woah!),617.0,0.97

AllanTheCowboy,0.0,577.0,"After reading another post, I wanted to share this story.

I made my first confession at 9, my second confession at 10, and my third confession at 34.  Basically I grew up in the 80's and 90's and learned confession wasn't a big deal, and it didn't matter much whether you went.

So I fell into a lot of horrible, horrible sins.  There are some you can read about in my post history.  There are others you cannot.  For about the last 15 years of those 24, on and off I knew I needed to go to Confession; that was what my conscience and my soul needed.  But I was afraid.  I was afraid of what the priest would say and how he would react.  I was afraid of the penance.  I was afraid to say the things out loud.  I was afraid that the Seal wasn't all it was supposed to be.  My only experience had been with face to face confession and I didn't realize screens were still an option.  I was afraid the priest wouldn't absolve me because some of the things I did were just so horrible.

So, a lot of things happened when I was 33-34 and I was finally driven back to the confessional to reconcile myself with God.  It took months to get up the nerve.  I went somewhere other than my parish so I wouldn't be recognized.  I made a list.  It was full of things I did ""countless times"".  Some typical.  Some horrendous.  Some I didn't think of until subsequent Confessions.  So I went in with this list.  I was prepared for judgement, lectures, admonitions, heavy penances, and horrified reactions.  And I knew priests heard everything.  I've got to tell you, I was a great sinner.  I mean GREAT.  Like, great at it.  I was proficient at horrendous sins, and had even felt great accomplishment in how good I was at some of them.  So even though I knew that a priest had heard everything, I still wondered if he would have heard some of mine.

So in I go with my list.  This priest clearly had a playbook for guys like me, looking back.

""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been 25 years since my last confession.""  I waited.  I waited for some kind of reaction to how horrible of a Catholic I had been for 25 years.  I got a barely verbal acknowledgement with an ""okay, let's get on with it then"" tone.

He seemed almost impatient as I listed each sin.  He kept giving me an ""mhm"" with this ""okay next sin, hurry it along"" implication.  It felt kind of weird and dismissive at first because part of me wanted to be chastised and berated and condemned.  But he just kept pushing me from one to the next.  This didn't give me time to fall apart or lose my nerve.  In the moment I kind of thought it was ""that sounds like paper... I better push this guy so the other people in line get their turn.""  And maybe there was some of that, but I look back now and I realize he was letting me know ""no problem; we can deal with that.  That one too.  That one too.  That one, too, no problem.  Yep I can absolve that - and I'm going to.  What else?  I can handle whatever you've got there.""  Then when I was done, he was great.  I had started to be worried that it was going to be a quick, ""ok you're absolved, next penitent please.""  But when I finished my list, his main message was ""you came here.  You confessed it.  You aren't here on this day by accident after 25 years.  God brought you here.  God's with you. God will give you the strength.  You keep trying and He will be there.""  And my penance was an Our Father and five Hail Mary's or something along those lines.

That priest gave me exactly what I needed that day.  God sent me to the right priest on the right day for what I needed to be able to come back properly to Him.  None of the things I was afraid of happened.  That confessor made it easy.  The hard part is entering the Confessional, and beginning.

I know how scary it is.  I was terrified.  It took me years to decide to go, and then months after that to actually go.  And that whole time I had nothing to be afraid of.  Nothing at all.  It's the best thing I ever did.

If you're scared, you don't need to be.  If you're ashamed, you don't need to be.  If you're paralyzed, ask Jesus to free you from that paralysis.  You are not beyond redemption.  If I wasn't, believe me that you're not.  You will look back on the day of that confession as the day your life changed forever.  The day your healing began.  The day you started to understand God's love.

And it'll only take about 10 or 15 minutes.  Your whole life can turn around in a quarter of an hour.  You can do this.  God is calling you.  God wants to forgive you.  You just need to go in that little room of healing, and ask him.

You can do this!  Step up.  The Holy Spirit is in you.  Let Him lead.  You can do it!",Catholicism,"For anyone Worried about going to Confession, Here is the Story of my Third Confession, 24 years after my Second",577.0,0.98

**PHILOSOPHERS ON ABORTION AND INFANTICIDE -** ***Frank Bouchier-Haye***

[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol2/bh.html](http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol2/bh.html)

With it, I have several major views on abortion that I am not afraid to share with others when the topic seriously comes up (and it seriously has, myself living in a very liberal city). I want to share a few of the points that come up often, both to hear what others think, but also so we can be legitimate consumers of the truth as political pundits ascend the podiums and spew lie after lie.

**Premise**: It's a woman's body, so it's a woman's choice \[to be pregnant, or not\].

**Answer**: This is a lie. It's not a woman's body, it's the woman's body and the baby's body.

**Premise**: It's okay to abort babies that are not viable outside the womb.

**Answer:** All babies are not viable outside the womb. Or viability is never guaranteed.

**Premise:** Abortions should be permitted for cases of rape and incest

**Answer**: Killing the baby will not undo the crime. It compounds the psychological stress of the act by adding a death to the damage done: the baby is not the rapist. Additionally, children born of rape or incest are not so different from us as we believe, nor do they want to be perceived/perceive themselves as less valuable to our society. One can even go so far to say that there are loving adoptive parents who would happily take such a baby in their home, and give it a future that few could dream of providing their children.

**Premise**: Overpopulation is an environmental issue.

**Answer:** Overpopulation is not an environmental issue, our unsustainable lifestyle is the environmental issue. An American has the same carbon footprint as over 200 people living in rural Africa or India, and these are people who are cooking with charcoal.

**Premise:** Abortions should be permitted if they will spare the mother's life.

**Answer**: There is no agreement among the medical community whether such cases even exist, evidence suggests that there are effective treatments for most situations (treating gestational diabetes and hypertension,up to and including early induction where both the baby and the mother's life can be saved.

**Premise**: Abortions should be permitted if a baby has a life threatening or debilitating/painful condition.

**Answer**: In utero diagnostics can be wrong, very wrong. What if you abort a baby based on a false positive? Supposing the baby were delivered and the condition was found to exist, would it not make sense to foster that child to the best of your ability up to a point of conscientious independent after which they can say whether they wish to live or die, in spite of their disability? For those disabled people, what do you think they largely wish regarding their life?: to live.

**Premise:** Reproductive rights provide economic opportunity to women

**Answer:** in parts:

1. Babies are not exchangeable. The babies that one kills early in one's life are not ""replaced"" when the family chooses to bear (and deliver) children later. 
2. Education and employment opportunities for women are not where they need to be in this country. If for a woman to achieve her best requires that she not have kids, then our society is flawed; we need to support mothers in tangible ways: we need paid parental leave as a federal mandate, we need to provide healthcare for pregnant mothers and early children
3. Low reproductive rate is a looming economic and public health disaster. The solution to this isn't simply telling women to have more babies, but asking what we ought to be doing to support families. ",Catholicism,"Before I became Catholic, my major conversion was becoming pro-life",572.0,0.95

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 the church has to limit attendance (and rightly so), but I managed to get a seat at the daily mass tomorrow. I plan on going to confession before the mass. This will be my first confession and reception of the Eucharist that isn't part of a ritual or ceremony. It's all very exciting.

I don't know anyone who really cares about stuff like this, so I am sharing it with a bunch of strangers on the internet.

Bonus: bad photo of me going to receive my first communion. I nearly collapsed afterward. (Not because of the heat, but it was also hot.)

modernwhale465,0.0,559.0,"So first just a little bit of background, I‚Äôm an enrolled citizen of a federally recognized tribe, while many people claim to have Native American ancestry they have no connection to the Native American community, their ancestry, culture, or language. So before somebody claims I‚Äôm just some white person whose grandma claimed had some distant relative who was maybe full-blood Cherokee, I can assure you this is not the case. I moved back to my tribal land to serve my community and engage my tribe consistently. I study my people‚Äôs language ·è£·é≥Y and want my children to speak it as well. 

Now that it‚Äôs out of the way let me just say that first and foremost I am Catholic, and being Native and Catholic are not mutually exclusive. Many people like BLM and other groups are calling out for the injustice done to Native Americans by early Catholics and it makes my blood boil. They care so much about tearing down statues of St. Louis and other saints for no other reason than blind rage, and I see some Catholics act passively as if it doesn‚Äôt matter. Everyone who wants to tear down a statue of a Saint is undoubtably wrong and misguided. I know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir but I think the point I want to make is that they do not actually care about Native Americans at all. NA‚Äôs have the highest teen pregnancy rate among American ethnic groups, poverty and alcoholism are rampant on reservations, and not to mention the countless missing and murdered indigenous women right here in America. If they actually cared why aren‚Äôt they helping with any of those issues that actually effect the lives of Native Americans? Why not help the Covid epidemic on the Navajo Reservation? 

The question may come up about all the historical trauma that NA‚Äôs went through by Roman Catholic clergy and missionaries and I agree it was evil but that does not negate that massive NA population within the Catholic Church here in America. Here are some facts for those who want numbers: 


http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/cultural-diversity/upload/Two-Rivers-On-Catholic-Native-American-Culture-and-Diversity.pdf

There are many devout Roman Catholics within the Native community, we even have Saint Tekekwitha! I wish the Bishops here in America would turn their eyes to suffering of indigenous brothers and sisters who so desperately need it. I wish Bishop Barron had said ‚Äúwe will help the people Pine Ridge SD‚Äù instead of ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù. So many people now think Native Americans only existed between Columbus to cowboys, not realizing the Canadian government was abducting First Nation children and trying to civilize them up until 1997! So for anyone who defends these protestors thinking they are helping Natives, you are not, in fact you are hurting 20% of NA‚Äôs by attacking their faith. 

I don‚Äôt speak for all natives and I‚Äôm sure there are many who would disagree with me, but as a NA Catholic I cannot let these people speak for me. BLM is protesting for civil rights, the indigenous people of this country want political rights, our treaties to be recognized, and our people to be given to them what they deserve, so you yelling at a faithful Catholic priest for defending a statue of St. Louis isn‚Äôt helping, it‚Äôs reducing NA problems down to a civil level which it isn‚Äôt. 

For my Catholics I just want to say there is no reason to apologize or white wash history, obviously recognize the historical trauma sure but don‚Äôt feel bad for the sins of others. 

I‚Äôll wrap up with an interesting fact, Father John Shoenmakers, a Jesuit priest brought Catholicism to the Osage People and impacted them so much that the Osage word for priest is ‚ÄúSho-Mink-Ah‚Äù and they still have a thriving RC church on the Osage Reservation today!

skysudds,0.0,559.0,"So, first off often I post in r/Christianity, but in coming back to Catholicism I've started posting and reading in this subreddit as well.  Anyway, my posts often get downvoted in that other subbreddit and my comment karma has been decimated.  LOL literally decimated at -100 now.  This isn't so much a ""hurt my feelngs"" thing as it means I can't comment on other peoples posts on reddit more than once every 5 minutes it seems.  

I've yet to have a single posts downvoted here and I was asking some pretty tough questions when coming back to the Church.  Got a +19 vote on a simple comment on here yesterday which will hopefully soon take me out of the -100 5 minute wait territiory.  

It's not only the upvoting here, but the attitudes and comments follow along with the positivity way more than what I'm used to.  I wanted to say that in coming back to Catholicism you guys on here have made me feel really encouraged about that choice by your positivity.  It's proof to me that there is an underlying unity in the Church that is missing in Protestantism.  I've missed that dreadfully in my separation and it's good to have it back... don't really know what you are missing till its gone sometimes ;).",Catholicism,Something I've noticed that is very positive about r/Catholicism...,559.0,0.96

Our discussions with one of the Reddit admins have stalled. We have recontacted the Reddit admin staff to see if we can speak to someone who is willing to discuss the matter. In the meantime, still know that if you wish to promote Church teaching on LGBT issues in this subreddit, it is at your own risk as the mods of this sub have no say in what AEO removes or which users they suspend.

We still ask that our subscribers not talk about this situation until our discussions with the admins have run their course. We would also like to add that we are not trying to rebel against Reddit in any way. We would just like clarity as to whether religious speech will be tolerated on their platform.

We will continue to keep the community updated on the ongoing discussions with the admin team over AEO's actions and we ask that you pray for this community so that we may be able to continue discussing our faith on Reddit.

FinnBalur1,0.0,527.0,"My parents wanted to send me to a Catholic school because they thought public schools will not teach me religious values. I attended it for four years, went to mass and had religion class. 

Going in, I knew nothing about Catholics. I learned so much valuable knowledge and information at Catholic school that I literally feel like there's a Catholic inside of me now (I consider them a 2nd family, of sort). Some religion teachers clearly did not care much about what they taught, but one in particular was so memorable, I will never forget all that he taught me and all our class discussions. He really opened my mind, taught me so much about Catholicism but I even started learning more about my own faith. (Mr. Wilson, shout out to you if you're here!) 

In a world where division and hatred are so rampant, I am so happy to have been treated with respect and love by most of my teachers and others that worked at the school. It wasn't what they taught, but it was the way they behaved and conducted themselves with respect, thoughtfulness, and kindness that really gave me such a good impression of the Catholic faith. 

Now when I hear things such as ""Catholics worship Mary"" and all these other misconceptions, I immediately and almost subconsciously find myself jumping to their defence, passing on what I've learned. 

It was a time in my life that I will never forget, and a community that has a special place in my heart. 

Peace and love to you all. 

Side note / unimportant / Confession: Mass was always held before lunch and I would be hungry, I always thought about just saying I'm Catholic so I could eat the bread. We had to cross our arms on our chest during mass so the priest knows we're not Catholic, and then he just blesses us.",Catholicism,I am a Muslim that attended a Catholic school in Ontario.

anyagrey,0.0,532.0,"We've been together for 10 amazing years. We've met at the church and our relationship always have been based in our faith. We were always together as active members of our community, especially him. But he has never mentioned before anything about a vocation to celibate. We were soon to be engaged. And now he told me he had felt the calling and must give it a try so that he wouldn't regret not to listen to it and resent me or make me unhappy. I can't be angry at him, I tried to, but I can't. I really love him and want him to be happy. I know he's a wonderful man and will be great at whatever he decides to do. But I am devastated. It was all so sudden and I was left with all these fellings and dreams. I'm glad God has prepared a beautiful path for him and he absolutely deserves all the fullfilness he may find. But what about me? I don't know what path to take, I'm frustrated in my own career, he was the only certain plan I had in my life. He was my bestfriend, my companion, my love and I know I was his. I wish God showed me a path too. I don't know how to pass through all these pain and sadness I'm feeling right now. I have known him since I was 13yo and we started to date when I was 15yo. I really don't remember who I was without him. I hope God has a good plan for me. üôèüèªüò≠

Edit: Many have questioned why our relationship was so long and why we didn't got married sooner. We were very young to get married, I had some breakdowns in my life during this time due to family issues and other stuff. We wanted to get married sooner, but we couldn't, and it was a choice made by the two of us together. We also wanted to be financially stable to do it, and in the country we live in, that's not a easy task. Anyways, we had our reasons and, unfortunately, we can't change the past. But I know him very well (at least I thought I knew) and he never seemed afraid of commitment. If he was, I don't think he would be with me for so long. I don't really understand what happened, if anything changed and what the future holds for us.  I guess we'll only know when God wants us to.

Whereas Joyfulness is a state of being that defines how we respond. It predicates how we engage with events or stimulus.

1) Being intentional with my prayer life. I don't enjoy prayer every day, that doesn't make it less of a responsibility.

2)  Limiting my ""world"". What percentage of thoughts is it healthy to have devoted to things we can't interact with or control? Politics, foreign events, silly fights online.

People used to tell me how much they admired me because I, a young woman, travelled so much, and I was always trying new adventures and meeting new people, and I studied hard and partied hard, and I exercised a lot and loved the attention I would get from men. Yet nobody knew that I was constantly busy with new relationships, social activities, hobbies, school, travelling, etc. because I absolutely hated myself. I wanted to escape myself. I couldn't stay alone for too long because I would spiral into a hole of self-hatred and ponder on all the horrible things that happened to me, and be swallowed up by unending guilt and shame.

Once I acknowledged my traumatic events, it led me to have even more panic attacks. The world told me that society was the problem, that everyone else was the problem, and that I had every right to hate society and distrust everyone. I reduced my identity to my sufferings. I was filled with so much anger and hatred. I absolutely hated being a woman. I thought God put me in the wrong body. I cursed my body, I cursed womanhood, I cursed men, I cursed everyone. I cried nearly every single day. I had panic attacks every week. I was suicidal and I often dreamt of killing myself and escaping this horrible world. The pain was swallowing me whole and I was suffocating, I didn't know what to do, I was lost and in agony.

Trauma is a demon, and those of you who have experienced tremendous trauma will understand what I mean. Trauma profoundly changes you mentally, physically and spiritually. Trauma changes your worldview. Trauma turns everything on its head. Trauma is a demon trying to devour your very spirit. Trauma made me feel unsafe in my own body, in my own world, in my own thoughts, in my own head. I wanted to escape all of this. I wanted to die. People will tell you that they are sorry for what you went through, therapists will say that your feelings are valid and to go exercise, and then what? These words did not comfort me and the pleasures of this world could not penetrate my broken heart.

Enter Jesus Christ, my last option. I thought Christianity was oppressive and boring. But I had tried what the world told me to do, and it wasn't working. What did I have to lose by asking God to come and heal me?

And make no mistake, God answers those who call to Him. Christianity tells you to look both at yourself and to Christ. New age spirituality tells you to deaden your feelings to escape the evil of this world. Secularism tells you to self-medicate with the pleasures of this world. But what do you do when this world was the very thing that broke your spirit? And how do you deaden your feelings, when your spirit is already dead? Christianity has taught me to look at myself and to look into heaven. I was able to face the shame, guilt and anger I had inside of me, and I finally let go of them and surrendered myself to God. I know now that the meaning of life is to be a saint. The meaning of life is to do God's will. To be fully human is to be fully divine.

I have learned to look beyond my despair and to look into goodness, beauty and truth -- all of which is Jesus Christ. Christ is the embodiment of Grace and Justice. He has taken my sinful self and nailed it to the cross in His infinite justice. He has risen from the grave, showing victory over my sin and death, in His infinite grace. Christ calls us to a higher life beyond satisfying the sensual desires. Christ says, give me yourself and I will make you fully alive.",Catholicism,How the catholic faith has tremendously helped my mental health,494.0,0.98

Several religion and philosophy classes in college pushed me to explore Catholicism and Anglicanism, and after much discussion and prayer, I ultimately found that the full fulfillment of truth could be found in Catholicism. A few months ago, I decided to begin RCIA this fall. I'm a rising senior in college who has been home for quarantine/summer, and I'd been putting off telling my family because I knew they'd have an ugly, visceral reaction due to our intensely Lutheran heritage. I didn't want to be stuck under the same roof as them for days/weeks after telling them.

My sister leaves for college tomorrow (I'm writing this after midnight though, so today), and I felt that I had to tell everyone while we were all together. I explained my decision after dinner and things were incredibly ugly. I was called a disappointment repeatedly, my father called his parenting a failure, and my mother just wept. All the yelling and screaming did nothing to change my mind; I'd heard dad's arguments from other people already. I went to a park once things had settled down and called my closest Catholic friends to talk about it with them. Basically just cried on the phone for 4 hours. Anyways, my family needs all the prayers they can get right now. Things are not okay.

Kajade,0.0,492.0,"So I am 19 yo girl. I am in my last year of high school. I grew up in a non-religious family and in a pretty secular country (Czech republic) - lots of bad things happed here during 40 years of communism in our country, lots of discrimination, killing of christians, destruction of churches. When I was about about 14 yo I was a scout with my friend, we had fun and big camp at end of year, on the camp every sunday we went to catholic church. I obviously wasn't baptised so I just listened to the priest and I couldn't take the communion. I also went a few times to church with my dad when I was younger (8-10) because my grandmother sang in church choir. I also knew two people in my school class who were christians. Fast forward to when I was around 16 I got really interested in religion again and I have decited to read the whole bible (I have never read the bible before). Unfortunately I found a really old translation of bible in my language and it was very archaic to say at least so I was confused, I stopped reading and for about 2 years I lost interest in christianity again and I started to research religions like buddhism, hinduism, judaism, I read a bit of koran after that I was sad again because I didn't find what I was looking for so I returned to researching christianity and than I found a newer translation of bible I bought it and I finally started to understand the bible much better I even started to pray and ask God to guide me. Today I don't have any christian friends but I do know some people in my neigbourhood who are christians. I tried to talk with my family about my faith but they don't understand, they are trying to respect my decision even though mum still thinks that going to church is weird and that I don't need it and can just have my faith for myself. I started to look up churches in my town. There are three churches in my town - two catholic churches (only one is in use) and one evangelical. I thought that I might start my conversion after the end of coronavirus but it seems that it will be here for a long time and I really don't want to wait anymore. I really feel that God is calling me. The churches here are limited but open. I went to the catholic church two times now (alone), just looking around what are some of the peole here like and listening to the sermon of priest. There are many young adults with small children, some older people and even few teenagers. I just can't seem to find the courage to tell the priest about my new found faith and my desire to be baptised.
Please pray for me.
I appreciate any help or advice.
Thank you.

brokenboomerang,0.0,484.0,"Over the weekend I found out that my childhood priest passed away. The vigil was Sunday and the funeral mass was Monday. Since it was streamed due to COVID, I was able to attend both virtually. This has all hit me so much harder than I could have imagined.

I was baptised by him in the city I was born in. When we moved to the suburbs, he happened to transfer to my local parish there. He was present for all my my sacraments through confirmation.

When I graduated, he moved to another church. It was about the same time I stopped attending, then I moved much further away. I never really made a place for church in my life as an adult, but still prayed. Still had a relationship with God.

When I heard about his passing, so many memories came flooding back. I had an awful and abusive childhood. I had never talked to anyone about it, but Father Don gave me the strength and the courage and the hope to get through it. He taught me tolerance and love and acceptance. He was responsible for just about every ideal I carry with me today. I never told him. I never can now.

He taught me that it is never man's place to judge others. That we have no right to condemn, and if God wants to judge others, He will. In the meantime, God is in all of us, and our only job is to love His children. To judge others for their sins is blasphemous as we then hold ourselves equal to God in judgement.

He taught me that I'm never alone. That God is always there for me, cheering me on.

He taught me that God knows what's in my heart. That all He asks is that I live with love in my heart and put others first when I have the capacity to do so.

He taught me that theres no shame in needing help, and that caring for myself is how I can Honour his gifts.

He taught me that there is room for both religion and science and they are intertwined. That curiosity is a gift. Learning is a gift.

He taught me so much. I never doubted his love or that God was with me. I never would have survived or made it this far had he not been such a presence of love and encouragement and acceptance.

There services were lovely. The stories were new and familiar all at once. He lived the Beatitudes with every breath and brought hope to everyone he encountered. 

I've been crying on and off for days. I said the rosary for the first time in years. I am just so overwhelmed with gratitude and sadness and regret and joy that I was lucky enough to have Father Don in my life as I grew up. Theres so much I want to express and prayers don't feel like enough. So. Here I am. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

Rest in Peace in his kingdom, Father Don. You wouldn't have even remembered me, but I'll carry you in my heart forever. You were a man of hope above all else, and that hope saw me through my darkest times.

I always thought catholics were the ones with the beautiful churches and beautiful, sacred traditions but my protestant upbringing told me that despite the beauty in catholic practices, they are wrong!!!!!

Now I'm on my way to be catholic. I don't see how someone can learn about church history and not be orthodox or catholic. I understand the difficulty in choosing between the Eastern orthodox church and the roman catholic church, but to choose to be protestant after learning about church history just seems illogical. I do understand that some regions are very anti-catholic (thankfully I live in a culturally catholic place so it's not very difficult for me, although I do have anti-catholic family members), and I really sympathize with them.

Anyway, learning about the Reformation movement is making me really sad. All it was were a bunch of men who claimed to have the correct interpretation of Christianity and of the Bible. Then these men disagreed with one another (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli), and they all sort of branched out from there. Denomination after denomination would be made. Without the authority of the Church, anybody can interpret the Bible as they please, anybody can throw out whatever doctrine or tradition that bothers them, and anybody can start a church so to speak. I heard of this quote somewhere that said, all you need to start a protestant church is a Bible and a pot of coffee. And my goodness, does this seem true...

I was on my summer break and was about to start college and I rarely went out so I rarely met with my girlfriend that time. I saw her as a blessing because I could relate to her struggles with her family and the like but the only difference was our faith. I always celebrate the Holy mass during Sundays and I always make time to pray inside every adoration chapel I pass by. She was also a catholic but she rarely went to Church on Sundays and prays only when she feels like it or needs something. I was very conservative and told her that I want to marry her first before having sex and all.

She went to a party during the summer break and she cheated on me. Of course I was devasted and felt like the world was crumbling. The night she told that she cheated and asked for some time off, I couldn't sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about her with another guy and I started to question everything about myself. That was when I saw the rosary a nun gave me in school. Right away I prayed the Rosary. I asked that the Holy Mother join me in prayer right before I start. In every Hail Mary, I added my intention. It went like this:

""Hail Mary full of grace... Mother Mary please pray for her that she'd realize that she doesn't need alcohol, parties and other guy's attention in order to live happily. May she realize that there are other things greater than those and that I can join her in appreciating the other things so we could both be happy. Thank you Mother Mary, I know you are praying with me. Holy Mary...""

I did that for every Hail Mary in the Rosary and kept doing it  the following days along with the memorare. It helped me open my heart and mind to accept whatever may happen next if she leaves.

3 days after that night, I received a text from her right before I was about to sleep. I called her, and she said:

""I'm sorry. I just realized that.. I dont need alcohol, parties and attention from other guys just to be happy. I also realized that there are other things to be happy from. Also I could just drink or party with you or anything and I'm already happy with that.""

At that moment I fell into tears and realized that my prayer has been answered. Word per word exactly as I said it during the Rosary. Right after the phone call I prayed the Rosary again as thank you to the Holy Mother.

We got back together but sadly we're no longer together. Maybe its the Lord's will that we met but not to end up with each other. I am still thankful for that moment and that I met her even if we broke up eventually.

I hope this post helps anyone who is having a hard time right now especially during this pandemic.

theingenuelover,0.0,457.0,"TLDR: Buddhism and Mormonism make me sad because they're weird so I became Catholic because they honor God the way he deserves to be honored. I'm technically a Catholic at heart. 

I know this is not r/exmormon or r/exbuddhist or something like that but this is one of the most supportive and one of my favorite subreddit so I'm gonna say it.

I was born and raised a Buddhist, it's a tiny bit similar to Catholicism so I got used to Catholicism real quick. I don't believe in Buddhism at all because I just...don't ""feel"" it and I was constantly in fear of my actions and sins that I can't just ""confess"". There is a lot of fear in Buddhism growing up. I discovered Catholicism one day through my kindergarten teacher. We were assigned a performance project for Christmas and she chose me to be Mary. I instantly felt a calling..some kind of calling inside me. I was meant to be a saint or something. I was about 7 when I decided to go to mass with my Catholic neighbor and my grandma was not very happy with the fact that I don't believe in Buddhism. I went to mass and I don't understand anything they're saying but I felt like there's lights shining on me unlike going to the temples or pagodas which is pretty cool too but I don't feel the same connection. It's like jogging through a forest in early summer morning with houses near by but everyone's asleep and you're the only one exercising. (If that makes sense lol). I stopped going to mass because grandma wasn't happy. 

When I get to Canada, (I'm Canadian). My family planned to go to church again, but we lived in a fairly Protestant dominated city so we joined this Presbyterian church. I was shocked because they don't honor God the formal way that Catholics do. I basically came there for the food. I quit church because of how ""improper"" it was. I'm basically used to Catholicism.

Years later, I moved to another province and I lived near a Mormon church, a community Spanish church and a Baptist church but I chose the Mormon church because ""well it's big so it must honor God the right way!"" The Mormon church is very formal but I still feel really weird because they have additional books ""Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenant, etc..."" It said really absurd things that my entire year at church was like the Get Out movie without the scary parts. The members are VERY forceful and there's a lot of weird rules that reminded me of the fears I lived with when I was a Buddhist. Church is like 3 hours! The Temple is like a big exclusive club that is VERY exclusive and there are so many secrets that I got a bit worried. It was beautiful though. Catholicism do a lot of ceremonies too but they at least tell other people about it. Mormonism is VERY exclusive. It said really heretical, racist things in the Book of Mormon. You have to be EXTRA HOLY EXTRA RIGHTEOUS to have a temple membership or something. I got depressed and left. My grandma somehow unknowingly gave me a rosary bracelet once and I kept it by me all the time because I felt protected and safe even though it wasn't blessed. It broke last year and I'm wearing the little crucifix on my necklace along with an heirloom because I don't have the heart to throw away the charm even though I always throw away broken, unfixable jewelry no matter how expensive. I just CAN'T throw away this one! 

Right now, I'm a girl in her late teens preparing for her adult life. I have always believed in God in general so I always have a picture of Mormon Jesus with me (they have pretty picture cards that fit my frame). I've always thought I would look good in head coverings but I don't know how, it was like a little nudge from Mary.
One day, I couldn't sleep and I decided to search up Catholic churches. I got invested as if I'm ""coming home"" or something. I woke up next morning and put all of my Mormon books at the back of my closet. I discovered veiling and boy oh boy...my excitement was through the roof!!!! I feel so safe in God and Mary hands. I feel like I've found my home. I had so many Catholic dreams lately and one about Mary talking to me or something. Even though I'm still in a bit of fear about disappointing God because I love him so much, I feel completely safe. The Catholic church really does honor God the RIGHT way the way he deserves to be praised. I love that so much.

Thank you very much, god bless you all.
Stay safe and take care.

Edit: hey guys, I didn't mean to crap on other religions. I actually think they're pretty cool. I'm just stating my experience and the negative sides that I feel. I have deep respect for Buddhism.

Of course there are exceptions, but it's undeniable that there's vast phenomenon of children falling out of their faith after leaving Catholic school. Too many Catholic households behave in a way similar to the 'de fide' ethic of many protestant households--Catholicism is seen as a presumed trait, a given, a mere tradition or heirloom of the familial enterprise. Families need to be more familiar with the rigorous defenses of the faith, the Church's intellectual tradition, and the strategy of Catholics apologetics. Thoughts or suggestions?

I suffer from scrupulosity and often think I'm separated from God and am going to Hell. I often feel physical pain when praying and also when going to church and receiving the Sacrament of Penance. My life has been pretty dark lately, a lot of temptations to despair, little hope in sight. But today I remembered the abundance of the good the Lord has produced in my life. I had strange ""experiences"" multiple times when praying the Rosary. I suddenly became very ""slow"" in pronouncing the words, I felt an overwhelming warm feeling in my chest and felt the ""inside"" of my chest moving, kind of leaping for joy. It was like I was looking at God, and the only thing I can tell you about Him is: He is Goodness, all Goodness. And He also looked at me, and it was like an all-filling presence.

So, I hope that someone reading this will benefit from this short message. I must emphasize, the Lord is good, He *really is* good and He wants all of us to be with Him. Do not be afraid to entrust yourself to Him, for He will give you rest. I was in thick darkness multiple times, but He got me out every time, for He is victorious over all evil.

HarpoonTorpedo999,0.0,444.0,"When I heard of many Neo-Pagans claiming that Christianity killed their cultures and that the church was an extremely cruel and deprave institution, I've started to research of what paganism really is and what are their so called ""civilized"" culture...And I was extremely appalled.....how in the living f*ck is paganism more civilized and benevolent than Christianity!!???

Here are some of the Greco-Pagan practices that I have found horrifying;
&gt;""Those born deformed or physically frail were especially prone to being willfully killed, often by drowning. Some were killed more brutally. For instance, Plutarch (ca. A.D. 46‚Äì120) mentions the Carthaginians, who, he says, ‚Äúoffered up their own children, and those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds; meanwhile the mother stood by without a tear or moan‚Äù (Moralia 2.171D). Cicero (106‚Äì43 B.C.) justified infanticide, at least for the deformed, by citing the ancient Twelve Tables of Roman law when he says that ‚Äúdeformed infants shall be killed‚Äù (De Legibus 3.8). Even Seneca (4 B.C.?‚ÄìA.D. 65), whose moral philosophy was on a higher plane than that of his culture, said, ‚ÄúWe drown children who at birth are weakly and abnormal‚Äù (De Ira 1.15). So common was infanticide that Polybius (205?‚Äì118 B.C.) blamed the population decline of ancient Greece on it (Histories 6). Large families were rare in Greco-Roman society in part because of infanticide.3 Infant girls were especially vulnerable. For instance, in ancient Greece it was rare for even a wealthy family to raise more than one daughter. An inscription at Delphi reveals that one second-century sample of six hundred families had only one percent who raised two daughters.
Historical research shows that infanticide was common not only in the Greco-Roman culture but in many other cultures of the world as well.""

Infanticide was so damn common at that time that time that people treat it as a common occurence. It is even said that life was so cheap in Ancient Greece and Rome that they literally throw babies to cliffs to reduce population and the emperors literally throw fckton of o*gies(Caligula and Nero)

Paganic Galatians worship their Goddess Cybele by castrating the devouts and splashing human blood from executed child to the altar of Cybele. It didn't last long however as Paul of Tarsus preach the word of Christ in Galatia therefore converting them

The daily sacrifice of Nordic Pagans to their altars by randomly picking children in their village, after that they place the child at their altar and SMASH their head with a damn HAMMER to pulp until blood starts gushing

The Inhumane amount of depravity is most shown in Roman Empire where so many damn o*gies are organized by rich patricians. One of the most depraved happenings was when Emperor Nero threw a party to celebrate his emperorship, the party included that the attendants can rape the daughters of the aristocrats without facing consequences, and Emperor Nero encouraged them to relish in immoral humliation saying that it is 'justified' because He told so (Nero proclaimed himself a 'Son of God' or the direct descendant of Apollo therefore his word is a word of god)

In fact even St. Augustine condemned paganism because they see human lives as cheap according to their morality compared to Christianity which says that life is the most sacred

feb914,0.0,435.0,"Yesterday morning I listened to a couple of podcast episodes by Fr Mike Schmitz about going to confession, especially about mortal sin. I haven't done any confession since lockdown and have committed some mortal sins since then, so I felt that this is my calling to go to confession.  

However, my parish was relatively small and there haven't been any confession even though public masses have been made available for the past 1.5 months-ish. Before lockdown there weren't many people going to confession (if there's any) so it didn't surprise me that the priest didn't hold it since he felt there's no demand.  

So I went to church slightly early yesterday (I go to mass on saturdays because my sibling and I are part of choir for that mass) with intention to ask for confession. But I felt quite shy to ask and not sure if the priest would be around early. Turns out when I came in, there were 3 ladies who're asking the priest for confession, so he held an impromptu one in his office (with 2m distancing and mask). I felt that God opened the way for me to do confession. However, there's even more miraculous thing.  

Few minutes later, came a relatively young man who I never saw in the parish, then he asked if there's a confession happening. I told him where the line up is and asked whether he usually go to this parish. He said no, he usually go elsewhere, but he's around the area and felt sudden urge to do confession. Had he come any other weekend, or even half an hour earlier or later, he would have missed the first confession our parish did in the past 4 or so months. For me that's a small miracle.  

Even the priest commented to me that his first time opening confession up in 4 months and there's a lineup. Hope this encourages him to start the weekly confession again.

God opens the way for those who want to reconcile with Him, so we shouldn't feel shy or afraid to confess our sins. He's waiting for us to come to Him, and if we intend it, He'd make a way.",Catholicism,A small miracle about confession I experienced yesterday,435.0,0.99

My mother and father were a young couple at the time of this event, and were on vacation in a major city as a reward for the fact that they had both just graduated from  college. My mother, being a history major, wanted to stop into a museum nearby, and my dad concurred after seeing that they had some special exhibition about eother coca cola or star wars. 
Anywho, they pay their admission, walk around this renound museum until they come across the Catholic Arts room. They wander in and it's the usual scene- lots of kids in Catholic school uniforms flocking around, depictions of saints and Jesus everywhere,  and of course and abundance of visitors. They're just standing around, admiring everything, when the woman in front of them said to her daughter- ""the Catholic church really doesn't like educating people."" 

My mother is so infuriated she can't speak. But my father, maybe driven by spite, the holy spirit, or both, tapped her on the shoulder. ""Ma'am, I'm Catholic,""

""And?"" 
""So's my girlfriend. We're graduates of Yale,""

After going through some really difficult times when I was around 17, I lost my faith and stopped attending church. I still prayed the rosary simply because I have always found it calming and meditative, but that was about the extent of it.

Haemorrhaging was awful, and I quite genuinely thought that it could be the end for me. It‚Äôs difficult to remember, but one of my main thoughts at the time was just to pray. I was terrified, and I just remember praying that God would help me to live for my children and my husband, and that if I didn‚Äôt make it, to please protect them and keep them safe when I was gone.

Yesterday at mass my priest gave a very powerful homily that I absolutely did not expect.

He first quoted Cardinal George about how his successors will be persecuted then martyred and then rebuild society. He very bluntly stated that we are living in dark times, have been for some time, and that this transcends politics and goes beyond (in America) Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, and even secular and religious. We are at a point where governments and corporations pose a direct threat to human rights, freedom, the ability to speak Truth, and how it is the Church's responsibility to uphold these things wherever she may be.

He then went on to describe that regardless of your opinion of the election or of politics, Joe Biden will be the next President. Whether or not you like this or think this it is legitimate, it is our duty as Catholics to pray for him as he leads our country.

That said, he stately bluntly that Biden has endorsed policies that are contrary to Catholic teaching (ie abortion) and in doing so has caused scandal as a self proclaimed Catholic. Because of this, my priest stated that if Biden were to come to this parish and attempt to receive communion, he would deny him as any good priest should in accordance with Church teaching. As Catholics we must encourage each other to abide by the Church even for, and especially for, our leaders.

He then finished by referencing the Cristero War in Mexico and the martyrdom that occurred. We should all live so that our last words may be ""Viva Cristo Rey!""

While there were plenty of people who seemed moved by this homily, an older women in her 60s came to him after mass and yelled at him. She said to him that ""Trump was worse, that the Church's teachings on abortion are years old and should be updated, that the Church has no right telling people what to do and is about acceptance, and that homilies like this are why less people come to Church"". My priest was very polite in responding and correcting each of these statements and stood by his words.

To me this implies that people don't seem to want to send their children there. Is it a coincidence that this is coinciding with the rise of the ""nones"" in society and the faith isn't being passed on?

Unless the Church catechizes the youth effectively, very few are going to grow up and desire to send their children to a school operated by the Church. I don't want to speak for others, but for me as a cradle Catholic personally I feel that I am Catholic in spite of my ""catechesis"" (if you can call it that?) not because of it. Just browse Reddit for \~10 min and you'll quickly see that the Venerable Fulton Sheen was pretty darn accurate when he said:

***There are not one hundred people in the United  States who hate The Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate  what they wrongly perceive the Catholic Church to be.***

So it's no wonder people don't see the value in an education provided by the Church - they don't really even know what the Church is or teaches. If you could go back and quiz a 16 year old me I shudder to think of how I'd answer various basic questions about the faith. Even for kids who go to public school when they do have access to a formal catechism class, there's little substance provided and even less that differentiates Catholicism from any other Christian church. Oh, and less still that offers any compelling reason to stay beyond a few ""feel good"" moments. Catechize more effectively and once those children have their own children, will anybody be surprised by higher enrollments?

Today has been terribly difficult. I talked to both a priest at our parish and the national catholic bioethics center. Both sources actually gave the same information regarding methotrexate vs surgery: there is no official teaching recognized by the Catholic church on this matter. Ethicists are torn on the subject for methotrexate use for an ectopic pregnancy. We were given the guidance to pray and make a decision that we believe is the best by using our well formed conscience. From this, we ended up feeling a lot more comfort and confidence in our decision. 

The guidance from these sources differed significantly from the advice given on this subreddit. I am certain that many on this subreddit believe that we have gravely sinned. I was given reassurance by our priest that we would not be in sin with either choice. After the fact, I read some of the replies on this subreddit out loud to my wife. They made her sob. She cried and said that she can't imagine that the God she knows would be asking her to undergo a dangerous surgery for her that will also reduce her fertility dramatically.

My wife quickly came to the conclusion that she would take the methotrexate. We decided to take the safest route to preserve my wife's health and safety. As soon as she made this decision, I felt so much releif. The only image that has been in my mind most of the day is the thought of my beautiful, young wife struggling for breath with a breathing to strapped to her face in the ICU surrounded by COVID patients. We are horrified of anything that could cause a relapse in her myasthenia gravis because it has been really well controlled recently. 

I'm confident in our decision. I don't think I could have chosen to have surgery if I were in my wife's place, so how could I have asked her to do exactly what I'm not brave enough to do myself. The doctors believe the medication is working and for now she is admitted to an observation room to watch for signs of a tube rupture.

We have prayed, cried, prayed, and cried some more.

They were talking about Aquinas, Augustine and all the rest. It scares me that excatholics were once people like us; they prayed through the saints, took communion, did confession and prayed the rosary. And now they're so hostile to our church, it gives me fear that I'll one day be like them.

OnePunchManOver9000,0.0,378.0,"I grew up in a catholic household with evenly loving family members. Everything was good, until High-School when I lost my great grandmother. She was the reason why my family tended to even be stable and have good relationships within it. Once God decided it was her time, it really broke me. Everything that happened after that stemmed from her dying. (I kinda started growing a ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs God‚Äôs fault mentality‚Äù shortly after.) 

My Father started being verbally aggressive towards everyone including me. My Mother started to get into major episodes of depression and started to pop pills. Which would make her very weak and start to fall over and be delirious of herself and surroundings. My family stopped going to church because of this. And in school my grades began to drop rapidly. So much so I was kicked from most of my electives and ended up with replacement classes from the courses I was failing. Also the bullying experience was practically the worst it had at ever been at my life. I committed a lot of sins just by thoughts alone. 

My mentality at this point started to get worse. I started sharing Anti-Catholic memes and even subscribed to podcasts dedicated to downgrading Catholicism. Freshman-Junior year I went very low. Depression was a huge problem at the time, and I couldn‚Äôt cope with it all. Than I met a gentleman who I will call, ‚ÄúSimon‚Äù for privacy reasons. This was near the end of senior year. Let‚Äôs just say he was involved with The Satanic Temple and gave me a brochure on why they weren‚Äôt bad. It talked about how everyone should live the life they desire and not live under a false prophet. At the time I took it and started to read about it. The next morning I called Simon and I asked for details about auditioning for membership. He happily obliged and told me to me meet him outside the Temple. I decided to go and they had members dressed in all black with candles in the shape of a pentagram. I was horrified considering my childhood, but I was so stubborn and lost. I decided to go through with it and It was the worst experience of all time. I betrayed everything I had ever stood for. I betrayed The Holy Trinity, My Grandmother, and so much more. I should have turned the other cheek. I won‚Äôt get into details on what occurred inside the Temple, but I will say it involved Ouija Boards, Satanic Scriptures, etc...

I was only involved for a short while, but now that I think about it. I felt like I was entrapped in my own personal Hell for months. I have since graduated from High School and currently under quarantine. I need to talk to a priest about my situation because I don‚Äôt feel better even though I made the decision to leave Satanism. Some part of me feels like in order to redeem myself for the irrational/irresponsible decisions I chose, I need to start over. Prior to making those ugly decisions in life. I had been baptized, I did holy communion, and completed confirmation. Now that I‚Äôm fully free of Satan‚Äôs grip, I find myself to still be stuck. All I want to do is bow to Jesus and beg him to forgive me for my ignorance and arrogance. I keep praying the Divine Mercy and Saint Michael to give me the motivation. I am trying, but I need advice, new verses, and new prayers. Please help me.

No, on the contrary, it is ever more intriguing, it has ever more to teach us, not in spite of, but because we live in such a disconnected age. 

It's about falling and getting up again. It's about sin and redemption. An overarching theme in Genesis is that, after creation, the world falls into an increasing state of disarray and wickedness. Who can't relate to that in modern times? And, yet, as we see, God does not allow despair to have the final word. There is hope. 

And, my, I can't stop gushing over the story of Joseph. It's a proper novella. The same stuff we talked about earlier applies here. Sin and redemption. Despair and hope.

I'd venture to say a large number of Christians *believe* this and it ends up causing a lot of cognitive dissonance. 

Although the importance of this issue may tempt us to avoid any risks of worsening an already significant issue, it cannot justify misinformation.


""34. Catholics often face difficult choices about how to vote. This is why it is so important to vote according to a well-formed conscience that perceives the proper relationship among moral goods. A Catholic cannot vote for a candidate who favors a policy promoting an intrinsically evil act, such as abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, deliberately subjecting workers or the poor to subhuman living conditions, redefining marriage in ways that violate its essential meaning, or racist behavior, if the voter's intent is to support that position. In such cases, a Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in grave evil. At the same time, a voter should not use a candidate's opposition to an intrinsic evil to justify indifference or inattentiveness to other important moral issues involving human life and dignity.""

huckdr,0.0,356.0,"I had posted a few days back that I hadn't been to Confession in 15+ years. Just before Christmas, I had been going through some tough times (mentally, physically, spiritually) and had reached out to my late Grandfather's sister, who is a nun, after she sent a Christmas letter to the family saying to get in touch if anyone needed prayers. I was in so much emotional pain, I was moved to tears and wrote her a long letter. 

A few days after Christmas, my spirits had lifted. I felt a transformation like I had never experienced before. I remember taking a walk at a park in the sunshine and wanted to scream from the mountaintops that joy had returned to my life. 

About two weeks ago, she sent me an email saying she had been praying for me and was asking the Holy Spirit for the right words to say to me. She recommended three books to help me get back in touch with knowing Jesus. I a few days later, I went to visit her at the convent, she showed me the chapel, and we prayed together. I got the three books from her; read one in a week (""Jesus: A Pilgrimage"" by Rev. James Martin) and currently working on the two others.

Something moved me in spirit and realized it had been a long time since I'd been to Confession. I got some great encouragement from this forum and a few users. I made a plan and worried for a few days; I was that anxious. 

I went to the Church early today and sat there in my thoughts and prayer. The priest was kind and welcomed me back. He gave me some advice on additional spiritual direction. I hope I made his day.

Anyway, it feels good to have faced my anxieties and used my faith to get through what I set my mind to. My nephew is making his first Communion in a month or so. I hope to be a good example for him as his Godfather and bring him to Mass soon with my brother.

fidrych1976,0.0,352.0,"I have been away from the Church for a very long time. Recently, I decided to come back. It had always been on my mind, but it finally reached the boiling point. On Saturday, I went to confession for the first time since my confirmation. I am now 27. As scared and embarrassed as I was to list off all the drunkenness and womanizing I had done, seeing the look in the priest's eyes when I said ""I have not been to confession in about 20 years"" brought me immense comfort and joy. I will never forget how excited he was.

On Sunday I went to Mass for the first time in many years, and even though I struggled to remember the prayers and responses, and had to wait for everyone else to say their part before I could softly whisper them to myself, I felt more at home than I have ever felt. The homily was all about how it was the first Sunday of Advent, and to be honest, I had been away so long that I had forgotten about Advent. The priest spoke of how this is the time to prepare for the arrival of Christ, and in the midst of my journey, I found it incredibly fitting. I have much more to learn, and much more to give, but this is the first time in my life I have felt so hopeful.

Before Mass on Sunday, I went on a trek into the forest with my dad. While we were out there, I saw a Stellar's Jay. It flew in and landed on a nearby branch, and bounced around from branch to branch all around me. According to legend, Alaska was discovered when Georg Wilhelm Stellar was out at sea, lost, with no hope.

I am deeply sorry to the Catholic community. I was raised Catholic and fell out of faith. I blamed the evils of the world on religion but I now see that the evil is within individual hearts and false prophets.

I did not have a good time in Catholic school. I found it restrictive and suffocating. However, I have always strived to be humble and have always thought of Jesus as an aspiring figure. The forgiveness and wisdom that is still relevant today embodief by his actions. I love the fact that he held no one in contempt, that he never seeked to destroy even those that would harm him.

My favourite story:

 &gt;Matthew 9:20-22

&gt; King James Version

&gt; 20¬†And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:

&gt; 21¬†For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.

&gt; 22¬†But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.

He never begrudge anyone their suffering and forgave her for taking his power in faith.

I used to hate religion then I saw the value in it and claimed myself agnostic. I have now found faith again and am deeply sorry for the generalisations that I put onto religion as a whole.

I don't know if I fully believe, but I want to believe. Not only that but I want to be as decent, brave and compassionate as I am able. Not to hold it over anyone but to remember and honour where these ideas came from. I don't want to assume my good, I want to actively work toward it. 

I'd like to return to the Catholic faith and I ask forgiveness, not for losing faith (as I believe that is up to the person) but questioning yours.

balrogath,0.0,354.0,"Hello!

Due to an large amount of threads about COVID-19, we are establishing a megathread to keep the subreddit from being flooded by an overabundance of discussions about the topic. Please keep all new conversations about the virus in this thread.

Please pay attention to your local governmental health organizations and follow the guidelines they put out. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to get caught up in the sensationalism that can be found in the news and social media.


We have put together some Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 and how it relates to your obligations and rights in the Church. Hopefully this can help answer any doubts that people may have.


**What is COVID-19?**

‚ÄúAt the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); previously, it was referred to as 2019-nCoV."" - Uptodate's page on CoVID

This virus has been compared to the flu; which is an inaccurate comparison for a couple of reasons. CoVID tends to spread more than the flu and has a higher mortality rate than the flu; which means this new pathogen is a public health danger that demands our attention. More importantly, the healthcare system has not factored in this new pathogen which raises the risk of hospitals getting overwhelmed; which is really the main threat posed by CoVID. In other words, our response to the virus determines how things will pan out more than anything, which is why experts recommend immediate enforcement of social distancing measures to relieve stress from hospitals. With proper social distancing procedures, CoVID's mortality and burden becomes manageable, as South Korea has so aptly shown. 

The virus mainly spreads through respiratory droplets and also through surfaces; so maintain a safe distance from others, avoid large groups, avoid touching your face, and keep your hands clean. If enough people undertake these measures, the virus' spread will slow which will allow hospitals to process the cases that pop up efficiently. This graphic illustrates this point: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES2zmPVUcAAYXDB?format=png and this twitter thread may be helpful as well: https://twitter.com/AbraarKaran/status/1237851055632703495

If youhave symptoms of any viral illness, call and coordinate with your doctor before showing up to a hospital to avoid infecting others or catching an infection.

*In all cases refer to medical/health experts and do not rely upon the subreddit for your physical well being, these are just helpful reminders/guidelines.*



**What are the guidelines for not attending Mass?**

The Catechism, paragraph 2181, says:

&gt; The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, *unless excused for a serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by their own pastor.* Those who deliberately fail in this obligation commit a grave sin.

If you are sick, you should not attend Mass out of respect for those around you so that you do not spread your illness to them. You do not have to go to Mass if you are sick; you do not need to ask your pastor‚Äôs permission for this.

If you are in one of the groups that is particularly at risk for contracting and suffering seriously from COVID-19, or regularly interact with people in this group (e.g. you‚Äôre a caretaker for an elderly person, you work in a hospital, etc) and there are a number of confirmed cased in your area, this also is a serious reason to be able to miss Mass. The reasons listed in the catechism are not exhaustive. If you are in doubt, consult with your pastor.

**Can I just watch Mass on TV?**

Watching Mass online or on TV does not fulfill your obligation, but if you are excused from attending for one of the above reasons it is an admirable practice to make a spiritual communion while watching a broadcast of Mass.

**Do I have to receive communion?**

You do not have to receive communion at Mass. While you are obliged to attend Mass each Sunday (unless  one of the factors as discussed above applies), you are only obliged to receive communion once a year during Easter time. [(canon 920)](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=920)


**Can my bishop forbid me from receiving on the tongue?**

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, paragraph 160, says

&gt; The consecrated host may be received either on the tongue or in the hand, at the discretion of each communicant.

*Redemptionis Sacramentum*, paragraph 92, says

&gt; ...each of the faithful always has the right to receive Holy Communion on the tongue, at his choice...

It is your choice whether you want to receive on the hand or on the tongue. A local bishop does not have the authority to overrule these universal documents. If you would like to receive on the tongue but a priest or EMHC refuses you, it is advisable to gently remind the person of your right but to be docile. If your right is not respected, you can bring the situation to the bishop or Apostolic Nuncio.

**Isn‚Äôt receiving on the hand more sanitary?**

The [Archdiocese of Portland](https://d2y1pz2y630308.cloudfront.net/12494/documents/2020/3/Cold%20and%20Flu%20Liturgy.pdf) consulted two doctors, one of whom was an immunologist. They concluded that:

&gt; ... done properly, the reception of Holy Communion on the tongue or in the hand pose a more or less equal risk. The risk of touching the tongue and passing the saliva on to others is obviously a danger however the chance of touching someone‚Äôs hand is equally probable and one‚Äôs hands have a greater exposure to germs.

No matter how one receives, it must be done so reverently to respect our Lord and properly so that germ transmission is minimal. For reception on the hand, this means placing one hand on top of the other with a flat palm; if your hand is cupped even slightly, it is more likely the minister will touch your hand. For receiving on the tongue, this means sticking out your tongue as far as possible and leaning your head back slightly to give the minister the largest surface area to aim for.

**God wouldn‚Äôt let germs be transmitted at Mass or through the Eucharist, would He? The Eucharist is a miracle!**

The Baltimore Catechism #1154 says

&gt;we must carefully guard against expecting God to perform miracles when natural causes may bring about what we hope for. God will sometimes miraculously help us, but, as a rule, only when all natural means have failed.

We should not commit the sin of presuming God‚Äôs grace; we can and should take all precautions that we humanly can, while still praying for divine intervention.



**In closing**

Let us pray for an end to this disease outbreak, and for our brothers and sisters affected by it.

O God, who wills not the death of the sinner,  
but that he should repent:  
welcome with pardon Your people's return to You,  
and so long as they are faithful in Your service,  
and in Your clemency withdraw the scourge of Your wrath;  

Almighty ever-living God, eternal health of believers,  
hear our prayers for Your servants who are sick:  
grant them we implore You, Your merciful help,  
so that, with their health restored,  
they may give You thanks in the midst of your Church;  

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,  
who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit,  
one God, forever and ever.

I went this evening and had a wonderful experience with a priest who showed so much mercy and grace.

I am able to take communion once again. My questions about moving forward with convalidation of my marriage and Baptism for my boy were answered. The solution was more simple than I had expected. 

However, I realized once I got home that my husband was unaware of what I meant when I said, ""I am going to Confession today."" We have talked about my return to the Catholic church, but he did not see it coming today. Happily, he agreed to validate our marriage in the Catholic church. But he is still pretty angry and confused at the moment. He is concerned about how we will raise our boy and the wedge that is now in our family. He and his family are pretty anti-Catholic. 

I do not disagree that we have a looming conflict, but I am not afraid or worried. God is capable of solving the most complex problems. This is nothing for him. Our boy will be Baptized in a way that both our churches recognize, that is enough for now. The rest will come. I will be praying with Saint Paul in mind.

Mr_Sloth10,0.0,341.0,"Our old IFB church was obviously very much resistant to it, I was the one to break the news to our pastor. I told him we would no longer teach Sunday school and we were joining the Catholic Church. He tried to talk me out of it for about an hour and ended up telling me ""you're gonna lead yourself, your wife, and kids to Hell."".

My wife's grandparents (along with our old church) view me as being confused by the devil and that I've brainwashed their granddaughter, even though she has told them she wants to convert. It's been pretty rough for her in that regard.

My family is against it, but they respect our decision to become Catholic, there isn't much strife there which is good.

My workplace has become very rough. All but 2 people are now against me, so much so that one of the higher ups had to get others to leave me be. I went from being one of three people allowed to teach at our company's Bible study to being someone who ""follows the devil"". I've been the source of jokes and mocking for weeks.

People's ideas about me have completely changed. I've went from being viewed as a Godly young man to someone who now ""worships Mary, follows the devil, and is sending my soul and my family's to Hell.""

Besides a very small number of people, we have no support, no allies, no one acceptance.

It started with how church and state should be separate, and it narrows down to how people used to take oath on a bible but now they can choose any book. A user (who seems to be atheist, if not anti-theist) said that they would take oath on the Lord of the Rings book.  

Why it fascinated me is because JRR Tolkien is a devout catholic and his The Lord of the Rings series have a lot of catholic themes, but it's not explicitly stated that even an atheist can enjoy it so much that it becomes a replacement of the bible for them.  

I feel we need to have more of these non-explicitly religious media that hold true to and even teach catholic values to secular audience. This will help evangelisation because a secular person who enjoys these media so much will find a lot of similarities between the media they love and the Catholic Church and teachings.

There is a double standard where if someone if openly Muslim, Hindu, Wiccan, or something, they're left to their beliefs.  But if someone is Christian/Catholic, the person i.e. the atheist, ropes them into a theological debate about the evidence for the existence of God and the merits of their religion.

[deleted],0.0,335.0,"I grew up in a home where my father was Roman Catholic and my mother was Methodist. My father attended Catholic school his whole life and then served 8 years in the Marines before being discharged for the loss of his left eye. He always told me that the nuns in Catholic school were tougher than the Marine drill instructors at Parris Island. He never liked to attend church, but would go to my mother's Methodist church where she taught Sunday School and where I was baptized. When we moved 20 minutes away from where I was born, we went to the Methodist church in my new town. Then switched to a Presbyterian church.

My assistant baseball coach was the Presbyterian minister and his church was closer to our home. My mother became very active in that church, mostly because she had a hard time saying, ""No,"" when asked to volunteer. She taught Sunday School there as well, sang in the choir, filled in at the organ when needed because she was a piano tutor, and became an elder. I was confirmed Presbyterian.

She was a college professor at a private Catholic college where I attended because it was mostly free with tuition benefits she earned for her family. This is where I was first exposed to Catholicism. Half the classes were taught by priests and nuns. I majored in English Lit and minored in philosophy and religious studies. Although, to say that I majored in lacrosse and minored in co-eds would probably be as accurate. They don't put that on one's diploma.

I've never met a more forgiving group of people than Catholic clerics and laity. Coming from the world of Protestantism, it was more puritanical. The church ladies ran the show behind the scenes and were often judgmental. Sins were intolerable, so there was no support system.

One of my favorite teachers was a priest who was good at basketball, rumored to have a bookie, had a TV show on EWTN, and was like a guy's guy. While not Catholic, I couldn't go to confession, but we certainly had our share of conversations outside of class where he took the time to minister to a group of us who were like the crew from *Dead Poets Society.* Our college chaplain was another great priest who used to swim laps every night at the pool where I worked as a lifeguard. He would always take time to chat and dish out fatherly advice. The nuns were also super great, filled with humor, and much different than my father described. Of course, this was college and not K-12.

I dated Catholic girls and went to mass. My only criticism of Catholicism is the push to raise money. I was used to a collection plate quietly passed in Protestant churches. Priests often really ""sold it"" to get donations from the pulpit.

But, what I really love about Catholicism is the structure and the Papacy. Protestantism is chaos. I couldn't even name all of the denominations. Worse, I do not agree with the policies such as same-sex marriage being condoned by the Presbyterian church. I don't have a problem with the LGBT community, I just can't justify how my denomination (and the Methodists may do the same soon) can allow ministers to perform same-sex weddings when the Bible is clear on homosexuality (at least among men) being a sin.

I see the Catholic Church as a strong entity not willing to cave to social pressure. Sure. The Church isn't perfect and could have handled things better such as the pedophilia problem among some priests, but we've learned that just about every organization that has dealt with children in the post-modern age hasn't been immune. I'm sure the Church of Rome will grow from this, find a solution to the problem, and continue the Lord's work.

I know there is so much other criticism directed at the faith since the church is claimed to have money. But, if that were the case, so many diocese wouldn't be struggling. In a world of powerful nations, the Vatican stands for the power of peace. So, thank you, Catholics.",Catholicism,Why I Love Catholics As a Protestant,335.0,0.96
broji04,0.0,331.0,"Forgive what may sound (and may be) pride, I genuinely want other people's thoughts on this as I may be in the wrong but I cant help but feel insulted that people think these are worthy messages to tell to 16-17 year olds. Since year 1 confirmation my confirmation teachers have pushed nothing deeper than ""God loves you"" or ""sin bad, God good"" I genuinely dont mean to sound like I'm better than them but really the stuff they've delved into is no deeper than a second grader level discussion on God. Specific lessons have delved into certain catholic subjects like confession or communion but those are simplified down to ""confess your sins and than get forgiven, no need to tell anyone about the sins you confess"" or ""God really is the Eucharist I know hard to believe but it true"" am I wrong to expect some deeper discussions about the faith. There is so much incredible stuff about the faith that can be discussed at a deeper level than ""God loves you"" and I think 16-17 year old can handle said stuff. Confirmation is a massive commitment to make and no one should make that commitment without a deeper knowledge in said faith. No one who is making this commitment should consider these messages novel. 

There are a lot of problems I and many other students have with this confirmation program, the bad attempt at being ""hip"" with those teens (trying to connect God to a marvel movie doesnt make us more interested in the faith"" or the authoritarian ""listen and learn without participating in a meaningful way"" teaching style make the lessons just really difficult to get to.

R120Tunisia,0.0,330.0,"So years ago I had to spend around two weeks in a village in Alsace, France for family reasons. I have nothing but praises for the region and its super friendly people. Coming from a country that was almost exclusively Muslim (unlike the Middle East and Egypt where there are native Christians) I decided to attend a Sunday church service in the Catholic church in the area just to watch and experience the local culture, I entered a bit late and sat at the back and watched them chanting what I assume were passages of the bible (surprisingly to me in French as I didn't know Catholic mass now uses the local language instead of Latin).

Then they stopped chanting and everyone went into a line and started walking slowly, not knowing what was going on I just joined them until I was standing in front of the priest who gave me something to eat, I just allowed him to feed me and then went back to my seat. After the service was over I immediately went back to my appartement as I had to go to Strasbourg that day.

Years later I became interested in Christian theology so I started reading up on communion and I realized that I fucked up, you probably all understood what I mean, as a non-Catholic I wasn't in fact allowed to take the communion.

Here's a really, really long and rambling conversion story if you want to read: 

I'm Chinese, both of my parents are members of the CCP and my grandparents are cultural Buddhists. Naturally my primary and secondary education was 100% atheist. Christianity, not to mention Catholicism, is probably never expected to be part of my world

When I was 9 years old my parents bought me a large book, a collection of stories and poems aimed for children, originally compiled by an American and translated into Chinese. It was in this book that I first encountered several stories from the Gospels, the life story of St.Maximilian Kolbe, the 23rd psalm, various poems about faith and God, prayers, etc. At that time I only had some rudimentary knowledge about Christianity from school and from other readings, but these writings moved and awed me, so much that after reading the 23rd psalm I tried for the first time to pray to the God these people described. 

Soon I started to search for ""Christianity' and ""Christian websites' behind my parents' back. I even managed to find a copy of Bible in my house, the book was older than myself - it probably came from my parents' university days, and the printing format was difficult for me to read. There's another book in our home called 'An Introduction to the world of God', which is just a mish-mash of random information about Christianity, for example the author's description of the Fall was entirely based on Paradise Lost, and hell was based on Inferno. I managed to finish a 'Stories from the Bible' kind of book and half of the translated Bible online during those days. I visited many websites, some of them were pretty weird, often made by strange underground Protestant family churches in China. I remember one of them told me one should never to go church and read Bible on one's own instead, because all modern day churches are corrupted by the devil. 

After 1 year of aimless searchings I finally summoned up the courage to tell my mum 'I want to be a Christian', and her first reaction was a chuckle. Then she asked me 'how much do you know about Christianity? """"What kind of Christian do you want to be? "" She never treated it as a serious thought, but still she helped me to find some articles about church history. At that time we happen to live right next to a Catholic church, one of the four Catholic churches on Beijing, we've entered the church once or twice, but I was too shy to go inside on my own and too unsure to ask adults to take me there. After another year of research and considerations it started to appear to me that Catholicism is the right path, the one true religion to follow.

Then I stopped there. I was around 11 or 12 then, again I was too shy and scared to actually talk to the priests in the church, I've heard about RCIA but joining RCIA lesson will mean that my dad will bound to know my little religion activities, and to me he's a loyal Party member and a stern father. Also I worried what would my classmates think or other adults think. And what if my idea will change as I grow older ? Will my parents ever allow me to spend time on classes as useless as RCIA ? 

So I waited and waited, in the meantime becoming increasingly interested in European medieval history and history of the Catholic church to want to go study abroad. From time to time I had doubts about God or salvation, once or twice I threw my bible under my bed and tell myself these ""Catholic stuff' is only a childhood fancy, but these thoughts never really left me. By the time I was 14 or 15 my classmates started to join the Communist Youth League, the youth group that every highschool student was expected to join. I was among the first student in my class to be nominated for the membership, by the time I graduated from middle school I was among the only 2 or 3 students in my class (of 45 people) that didn't join. 

I reached 16, and my life took a big turn as mum decide to send me to study abroad, in a boarding school in UK. For the first time in my life I no longer need to think about what will my parents think or what will other adults think, no one here knew me and I can be a completely different person. But my highschool was really secular, not a single priest/minister/reverent to be found, not to mention being located in the middle of nowhere. There's a school bus to take students to the nearby  city every Sunday morning, and I took the chance to go to see the mass, but it's impossible to participate in more church activities. We do have a Christian Union at school - mostly Protestant and Evangelical, lead by our lovely maths teacher who married a Korean evangelical preacher. I ended up becoming one of the exec of Christian Union, organizing bible study groups and volunteering projects, which is so ironic as I was not even baptised. 

During my first year in uni (still in UK)  I approached my dad for the first time to talk about 'Dad I want to join the Catholic faith', which I should have done years and years ago. He was understandably shocked, spent the next weeks trying to talk me off this fancy, arguing with me and my mum. I was seriously shaken by these arguments, not because he said ' why can't you be like other normal young people ? "" ""both me and your mother have been  upright party members, what has gone wrong with our education? "" but because I realised having a Catholic daughter can affect his career. He's a civil servant in a CCP administration, and if his superiors find out - 'how come that as a cadet of the Party your own daughter had converted to Catholicism?""  . And how can I allow this to happen ? 

In the end my dad still think converting to Catholicism is strange, but he said he'll support me if this is what I really want, after all. And he's still a little disappointed that I will never become a member of the CCP and thus probably never enter the country's establishment, on the other hand, he knew that I'm too much of a liberal ( 'liberal' as oppose to authoritarianism and Chinese traditionalism) dissenter to join the Party willingly, baptized or not. ""My colleagues may not find out if you got your baptism in the UK, ' he said,  'and I'm going to retire within a few years so there's not much hope of promotion for me anyway. "" 

So I was scheduled to be baptized in my second year, but during that time I was diagnosed with depression and had to take 6 months off study. So it was put off til Easter this year, but then covid happened. I said to my parish priest that 'It's almost like our Lord is throwing obstacles after obstacles in front of me, so I can realise that whatever what happen he'll always stick to me. Always, like, literally."" 

And sometimes I think maybe, maybe someone somewhere in this world or the next had been praying for the spread of the Gospels and the conversion of other people, and one of his/her prayers is being realised through me. 

Anyway now that churches are partly reopened and I'm back in UK, I'm finally going to be baptised this coming Sunday. 12 years after the first time I came across the 23rd psalm in a book for children, and 5000 miles away from home.
