**But the next fight is upon us.**

This week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.

And Wall Street hates it.

As of right now, Robinhood and most other trading products are in ""reduce only mode"".

Wall Street has decided that you're not responsible enough to buy the stocks that you like, so they've taken away your stock buying privileges.

[deleted],0.0,14185.0,"Hi guys,

I'm from a third world country called India. The right-wing fascist government here is planning to ban all cryptocurrencies. (They are so tone-deaf they called Bitcoin a [""private cryptocurrency""](https://www.newsweek.com/india-drafts-bill-create-government-cryptocurrency-ban-private-cryptocurrencies-exceptions-1566558)). 

Of course, you can never ban Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature and you might be thinking why I am selling my crypto when I could just as easily use a VPN. Well, the answer is that you don't live under this government. In 2019, the country was undergoing civil unrest with riots in the capital in the [CAA protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests) against a bill that discriminated based on religion. They silence journalists, kill protestors, and control not only just the media but also the judiciary. It's. fucked. up.

Currently, many [farmers of the country are protesting against the new farm laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers) which have been deemed anti-farmers and pro-corporate. The government was apathetic to the protest initially and then they were cruel, and brutal. 

[When Greta Thunberg and Rihana tweeted about the issue](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rihanna-farmers-protest-mea-7173657/), the government lost its mind and used the Ministry of External Affairs to issue a statement... against a pop star and a teenager. The protestors are also dealt with harshly and Delhi has been turned into a fortress keeping them out; more than a hundred farmers have died but the government remains apathetic.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India prohibited all banks in India from accepting cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. However, the industry went to the Supreme Court and the order was deemed unconstitutional in March last year. The crypto industry rose in India again and just as more people were buying in, the government comes out with a bill that fines a person 3x to 10x their gains on crypto or a jail term up to 10 years, or both. 

The worst part is that the bill states that it's up to the government to decide how people should dispose of their crypto after its banned. And you know what, it's not beyond this government to take all the crypto for themselves and claim they ""destroyed it"". [All governments have a history with corruption in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_in_India). My exchange is linked to my bank accounts and my central government tax ID, and they can easily track me. 

That's why I'm selling everything I have, for now, just to wait it out and see what happens with the bill here. I really don't want to sell but I think it's better if I cash out instead of letting the government decide what I should do with my coins or face jail time.

I know India is probably not in your circle of concern right now but Bitcoin was about decentralization, about resisting government censorship and it seems the fanatical government is hellbent on making sure nobody can hold crypto by threatening harsh punishments and penalties. However, this is also good for crypto because the government is scared of it due to its growing power, just like its scared of Rihana and Greta Thunberg. 

I hope the bill never passes but most likely it will and bring an end to the crypto industry here again.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow ‚Äúonline payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.‚Äù
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don‚Äôt try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don‚Äôt see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin‚Äôs cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let‚Äôs get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I‚Äôm kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron‚Äôs founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an ‚Äúinternet of blockchains‚Äù.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD

32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it‚Äôs actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.

35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it‚Äôs the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance‚Äôs), for example fees discounts.

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it‚Äôs commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person‚Äôs identity, it‚Äôs often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.

wolfmangpuck,0.0,13211.0,"If you are buying on Robin Hood you do not control your coins and you cannot transfer them to a wallet or to any other exchange. 

In addition to this, trading is frequently halted due to volatility as we saw with Dogecoin yesterday which in some cases means you won‚Äôt be able to sell on a massive drop, even with a stop loss order in place. 

There is also often a large gap between the current sell price and buy price which should not be happening for coins with decent volume. 

Buying on Robin Hood defeats the whole decentralized point of cryptocurrency which allows you to be in control of your coins. And if if you are coming here from WSB, fuck Robin Hood anyway. Don‚Äôt support these slimy market manipulators. 

That being said, market manipulation also exists on any crypto exchange so be aware of pump and dumps, especially when coins instantly shoot up in price with no real rhyme or reason. Be safe out there.

EDIT: Since so many are asking what exchanges to use, personally I would recommend Coinbase or even better Coinbase Pro as the fees are lower. From there you can transfer to Binance (Binance US In the states) or other exchanges if you wish to continue trading. You can also buy directly through Binance although I find their fees to be a bit steep. There are several other options too such as Kraken, Bithumb, Gemini, etc. although Coinbase is probably the easiest to use for beginners.

EDIT 2: To clarify, if you bought on Robinhood you likely aren‚Äôt going to lose your investment or anything like that. I just wouldn‚Äôt recommend it because it defeats the whole purpose of crypto and technically what they are giving you is an IOU for what the coins are worth based on market value. Technically though you don‚Äôt own or control the coins which to me is one of the coolest things about blockchain technology.

EDIT 3: I might get blasted for this one, but if you are new to crypto and just trying to buy Dogecoin, please be careful. As you can see with the huge and steady drop, this is what‚Äôs known as a pump and dump which is unfortunately is very common in crypto. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt make money by timing your trades, but it‚Äôs very difficult to predict and most of the smaller traders will end up losing. If you are planning on buying and holding a coin you may not want to invest in something when it‚Äôs already up several hundred percent.

I hope this post gets on the frontpage here cause all these ‚Äúdip‚Äù posts give me (and probably a lot of others) flashbacks to 2017-2018, you know, when we were nearing a real top followed by a real bear market aka the real dip aka the discount DCA market.",CryptoCurrency,"Stop calling this a dip, bloody monday or whatever negative word you can find for this normal volatility in a parabolic move upwards.",11571.0,0.85

**EDIT 5:** Huge shoutout to the /r/cryptocurrency mods. You guys are amazing.

Me and a few friends tried to warn them but with all the Wallstreetbets and GME hype, it allowed a ton of crypto newcomers who didn't know what a ""pump and dump"" scheme is to get scammed.

This comes right after the large doge dump.

The worst part is, their moderators made no efforts to remove posts related to the scam. It is reported that /u/nvok (a moderator of /r/Ripple and /r/XRP) and fellow moderators were allowing the scam to be promoted and were removing posts that were negative towards it. They also ban any users that critique Ripple or XRP (the token of Ripple). It is unknown if they were involved in the scam, but it is evident they failed to educate their users.

Feel free to **report both of those subreddits** by contacting reddit admins. You can find any post in /r/Ripple or /r/XRP and report it via the reddit contact us page as there is no other direct way to report a subreddit. They, /u/nvok and other moderators need to be investigated.",CryptoCurrency,The entire /r/XRP subreddit just fell for the most hyped and largest pump and dump scam in crypto history,11271.0,0.94

bose25,0.0,10318.0,"It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. 

It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.

It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. 

November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.

We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.

It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.

By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.

It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. 

Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.

It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. 

It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.

It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.

It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: ""ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..""...

Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is ""crash"".

Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.

It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my ""How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.

It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.

Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.

It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.

It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.

It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.

It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.

Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now.

We made the video and sent it in. This is in hindsight, a mess up on our part, as he sent the wire from his closed bussiness account, which is now a personal account to him. The assets of the company were sold, but obvisouly the bank account is still his. You don't sell you bank account with a business, that would make no sense since a dollar == a dollar. But this is what we replied with.

&gt;Attached is the video. I'm having trouble with attachment size, as it only allows up to 25mb, so I have to send the bank statement in another email. I had to make the video 720p.

\- Is R\*\*\* Electric Construction, Inc still in business? If so why was that account closed and do you have a new account opened?  
\- Can you provide us with documents showing that you are the owner of R\*\*\* Electric Construction, Inc?

We replied saying: 

 

&gt;1. My grandson is helping me with buying Bitcoin. He helped me signup, then left it to me to make the wire deposit. I didn't know it would be a problem send the wire from the R\*\*\* Electric bank account.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2. R\*\*\* Electric is no longer in business. I sold R\*\*\* Electric Construction to a company called XXX XXXX over a year ago. They bought the assets of the company, not the bank account, or my building. They don't use the R\*\*\* Electric name. I have the settlement statement attached. The bank account is still opened, and is the same account that I used when the business was in operation.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;3.¬† There is the Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) and the Settlement Statement attached from when I sold the company. I hope this is sufficient.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;4. I think there would be two locations. First one would be \*\*\*, which is where my shop is from when I had ran R\*\*\* Electric. Then the second location would be at my grandsons house in \*\*\*. We signed up for Binance and did the verifications from my shop, then the day the wire deposit was transferred, my grandson tried to login from his house to help me out with buying Bitcoin. Since then the account has been locked.

Patient we we're for almost a month with no response

&amp;#x200B;

**November 22nd:**

 

&gt;It has now been a whole month since I have sent you all my information proving that I own the R\*\*\* Electric bank account. It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn‚Äôt give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn‚Äôt have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn‚Äôt take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn‚Äôt seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn‚Äôt want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don‚Äôt see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Don‚Äôt give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account. For all I know, I am getting bullshitted by you guys, and you may not even be doing anything to fix this. Just keep dragging it on for another year, maybe I‚Äôll be dead by then.

&amp;#x200B;

Well well well, you send them a nasty letter and they are right on top of it.

&gt; Hi-  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm really sorry about the delay here, somehow this ticket was pushed back in our queue. We are definitely handling this and I reminded the team as well. They did ask for one more thing, can you get a note from your bank stating that the R\*\*\* Electric corporate account was closed? We will need that to proceed. I will be handling this going forward, don't hesitate in asking questions and I'll make sure I answer them in a timely manner. Thank you and again, apologies on the delay here.¬†

This dude is acting like he is here to help, and he had us fooled. Anyways we apologized for that email.

&gt; Thanks Biggs. Sorry for my rant, I appreciate the response. The R\*\*\* Electric Corporate bank account is still open as I am still chasing invoices from when I was in business. The business itself is closed.¬† 

&amp;#x200B;

**November 23rd:**

&gt; Hi,  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It's completely understandable. I need to follow up with the other team, just left them a memo and will touch base when I hear back. Feel free to message me if you do not hear from me tomorrow, but I expect to have an update then.¬†

&gt; Dear Mr. XXXX,

From here, we have nothing but problems trying to do a wire withdrawal. Sent him an email.

&gt; When I go to the wire withdraw page, it has my name locked in and I can't change it to R\*\*\* Electric. Should I just wire it to my Greenwood Credit Union account instead, or do you think the wire will work with my name? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Greenwood Credit Union sounds like your best bet then.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

So we try it, and it's not working, we sent an email to him again.

&gt; I started the wire, but I haven't received the confirmation email from Prime Trust. It's been around 20 minutes, checked my spam and everything. I added¬†[info@primetrust.com](mailto:info@primetrust.com)¬†to my contacts, not sure if that is the email to whitelist or not. Should I try to do another wire withdrawal? 

&amp;#x200B;

**November 25th:**

Wire isn't working, tried a bunch of things but the confirmation email never gets sent to confirm and start the withdrawal. 

&gt; Hey, I went to the account and under withdrawals it said failed, but like I mentioned I never got the email to confirm it. I tried again, and the same thing is happening. I attached some screenshots. 

&amp;#x200B;

**November 27th:** 

&gt;Hey Biggs, I‚Äôm not sure what to do about the wire transfer. I triple checked all the information and I know it‚Äôs correct. It knows the bank name automatically once I enter the information, which means to me the routing number is correct. It says failed under the status for each try I did. Even right after I put the info in, I never seen it say pending, or open, just failed. I‚Äôm not getting the email to confirm that I want to withdraw, so I don‚Äôt think your team will ever get it.¬†I tried to use the checking account number instead of my savings and that didn‚Äôt work either. I can‚Äôt change the name of the wire¬†to try to send it to the R\*\*\* Electric account, so I‚Äôm not sure what I should do. If you would let me buy DAI then get off your exchange, that would work, but don‚Äôt know the legality of that. Let me know, it‚Äôs been over that 72hr limit and I‚Äôm not sure what to do here.¬†¬†

 Still doesn't work, sent him a reply

&gt;The same thing is happening. Is it normal for it to say failed under the status on the withdraw page, as soon as you submit it?  


&amp;#x200B;

Stuck in limbo, I tried to so a wire withdrawal 6 times, different banks, and even different account numbers for each bank. Never worked.

 

&gt;Hello Biggs, I have tried to withdraw to another bank account, this time with Washington Trust, and the same is happening as the other bank. What can we do here? Doesn't seem like wire withdrawals are going to work.

**December 6th:**

**THIS IS THE REAL KICKER OF THE WHOLE STORY, GET A LOAD OF THIS SCHEME.**

A little background here. I didn't try to do ACH originally because my grandparents are scared of online banking. I sent this email asking about doing ACH and if it is alright, and in the mean time, convicted my grandparents to sign up for online banking with Washington Trust, since that was the only bank that they have that was on Biances ACH list.

Mind you the account has been active now for a couple months, with withdrawals only enabled.

**December 6th:**

&gt;Hey Biggs, my money is still on the exchange and wire withdrawals don't work it seems. Is there a way to maybe go straight to Prime Trust to withdraw it? I see there is ACH, as well, not something I really want to do, but would it work if I setup online banking with Washington Trust? Or would it not work since my account is limited?  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

**NO RESPONSE AT ALL BUT THEY FUCKING DEACTIVED THE ACCOUNT RIGHT AFTER THAT EMAIL ASKING ABOUT AN ALTERNATE WAY TO GET THE MONEY OFF THE EXCHANGE**

&amp;#x200B;

**December 7th:**

&gt;Hey, I am looking to talk to Biggs. I just got my online banking setup with Washington Trust, and now my account is disabled with the $100,000 on there. I was just logged in yesterday. This needs to be fixed, I think I finally found a way to get it off since wire withdrawal were not working, which I have sent numerous emails to you about. I haven't received a response from you in a few emails now about my troubles getting the money off, and now you close my account?¬†

**January 8th:** 

Sent them an email

 

&gt;REQUEST #45390  
  
&gt;  
&gt;That's the request ticket number that goes with the emails, incase I get someone other than Biggs. I need to get my money off the exchange, and I have been trying wire withdrawals at different times, and none of them worked. I never got the confirmation email, on 5 or more tries. I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either. I never done online banking, but I saw ACH on the withdrawals page, and since wire isn't working, I decided to bite the bullet and enable my online banking with Washington Trust.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;My account has been limited from trading for over a month now, and only had it enabled to withdraw, which never worked with the wire method. I never got help form you guys, after sending multiple emails.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A couple days ago, I emailed you guys about trying this ACH transfer, asking if it would work. In the meantime I went ahead and got online banking setup anyway. The very next day my account is locked. Having it limited for months, then me emailing you the day before, asking about me trying ACH, then having the account DISABLED just before I got setup with my bank for online banking, looks like a scam. A lot of actions over the past 5 months have seemed like a scam.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;What happened to Biggs taking this ticket personally until I got settled? Seems after I never got confirmation emails from the wire withdrawals, and adding Prime Trust to my email contracts/whitelist didn't work, he just stopped talking to me.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Last time I was ignored, I had to send a nasty email to you guys, then all of a sudden I started to get help. Then I cooled down, and yet again you guys are ignoring me.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This has been quite a few emails now without a response.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Get back to me soon, or I will have to take legal action. This is absolutely ridiculous. All my emails and screenshots I have taken, I am ready to go to court.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 11th:** 

  Sent them an email

&gt;You're killing me here with this whole thing. Not sure why you locked my account, could you please enabled it again with withdrawals only so I can get my 100k off of there trying this ACH method.

As I was doing my research on alt coins I found market cap to be essential in understanding the relative size and the potential upside of different coins. I found myself constantly doing mental math using CoinMarketCap data, so I decided to build myself a little private website to help with all that! Example: ""_if coin X had market cap of coin Y, it would be worth $Z_"". I figured others are probably in the same position, so I published it yesterday for the world to use. :)

I proudly present to you **[thecoinperspective.com](https://thecoinperspective.com/)**!

**Features:**

- Supports the top 500 non-stable coins/tokens as per CoinMarketCap data. I can add more, if required.
- Quickly see impact of different market caps using a slider, as well as input a hypothetical amount of coins to calculate total worth.
- Supports multiple reference fiat currencies (USD,JPY,GBP,CHF,CAD,AUD,HKD,CNY)
- Coin data is auto-refreshed every 3 hours, including Fiat exchange rates
- Mobile friendly
- No ads, no spam (LPT: use uBlock Origin if you don't already)

I'm still tweaking the UI -- if you have suggestions let me know.

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the feedback!
- Now supports Dark Mode (will default to your OS preference)
- Now supports manual input
- WIP: advanced view, where you can specify all the parameters!


Hope this helps someone. 

p.s. Full disclosure: I piloted this website yesterday in a specific altcoin's subreddit and feedback was very positive and their suggestions helped me drastically improve the website.

steavus,0.0,7238.0,"I wanna share how i became a millionaire using technical analysis and maybe you can do it to.

Technical analysis is the study of statistical trends, collected from historical price and volume data, to identify opportunities for trade. Technical analysts observe patterns of price movements, trading signal and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength and weakness of an asset. ¬†

Technical Analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data such as cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities and stocks.

A chart of prices and volume represents all the past decisions taken by market participants (buying and selling). This information will, in turn, affect future participant decisions in two ways:

* **Psychological**: What you did in the past affects how you approach future situations. For example, many traders tend to focus on the price at which they bought an asset, and if it declines, they want to sell when it reaches break-even again.
* **Reflexive**: Some traders identify trends and chart patterns which are common, and act accordingly (buying or selling). If a sufficient number of participants follow the same strategy, it is expected that these chart patterns will follow the expected outcome and that the trend will likely to be sustained by more and more participants joining the trend.

**Bollinger Bands**

Bollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope) with a simple moving average in the middle. The width of the envelope expresses the volatility.

Volatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset can increase or decrease. A higher volatility means that the asset can potentially **fluctuate rapidly within a larger range of value**.

**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (or MACD) is a trend following indicator that looks at the combination of two moving averages:

* A short-term moving average
* A long-term moving average  


These two moving averages are combined to identify what is the current trend and if there is a change in the momentum.  


The MACD lines displayed below can be interpreted as follows:  


* If the blue line (MACD line) is above the orange line (Signal line), the momentum is bullish.
* On the contrary, if the blue line is below the orange line, the momentum is bearish.
* When the lines diverge, it denotes a strengthening of the current trend while a convergence shows a trend reversal.
* When the lines cross, it is likely that the change in momentum is confirmed.

Weaver96,0.0,7166.0,"A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

# Why do you need a wallet?

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **""Not your keys, not your coins.""** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. 

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**

Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. 

Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. 

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

# About wallet types

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. 

**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. 

**Mobile Wallet** \- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

**Desktop Wallet** \- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

**Paper wallet** \- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

# The Best Hardware Wallets

**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. 

Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. 

**Trezor (One and Model T)** \- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

# The Best Desktop Wallets

**Exodus** \- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. 

**Atomic** \- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.

# #1 - Staking

Staking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.

Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.

You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.

# #2 - Airdrops

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ‚âà $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.

It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)

# #3 - Reddit Moons

Most of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?

""Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you‚Äôve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They‚Äôre all yours.""

In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.

To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!

In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.

# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.

This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.

While the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.

If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.

# #5 - Coinbase Earn

Not a ""passive"" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the ""It ain't much, but it's honest work"" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.

In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.

Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!

You might‚Äôve seen several posts explaining why keeping your coins in a wallet is the best way to hodl. This is true, if you have a significant amounts of a particular coin because then you will be able to cover the expenses of transfer fees which vary from coin to coin.

But with the rise of newcomers, not everyone can afford to buy large numbers of coins. And while you might be tempted to take your coins off an exchange, think about the amount you will spend for fees. For example the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH (~$35) sometimes this is the amount most people have. Similar example can be applied to other coins as well. 

Another point is that exchanges are not un-secure anymore. They will store coins with high security measures. And you should enable things like 2FA to keep your account even more secure. So don‚Äôt worry about your coins being in danger.

If someone has any other suggestions please let us know.

Edit: Tips from comments:

1. From u/ACShreds - Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month so if you do want to withdraw coins, try buying from that platform although the fees are a little high compared to other platforms.

2. From u/thegooddocgonzo - Although exchanges aren‚Äôt fully safe, many big and reputable one like Coinbase and Binance will do everything to keep your coins safe because they don‚Äôt want any bad reputation. The user also notes that Binance was hacked in 2019 and Binance made sure that no customer was impacted. Stay cautious of smaller and unknown exchanges.

That's a 400% increase in less than 48h. For comparison, transaction fees on Cardano are only 0.17 ADA.

Siamak71,0.0,4952.0,"Seeing the post about Iran officially considering farming Bitcoin, I felt motivated to make this post as an Iranian. Cryptocurrency has changed the dynamics in Iran. The Iranian government's view on it has been quite lax compared to neighboring countries or other Muslim countries. There was either support for it or it was simply ignored since you couldn't really spend it on anything. On top of that, given the fact that Iran is disconnected from international banking, there was less concern from Iranian banks. (A bit ignorant, but I am not complaining)

But things have changed drastically over the past few years. The increased sanctions and COVID have brought a lot more people towards crypto, including me. Crypto has a very unique situation in Iran, which I will try to explain briefly. The Iranian currency is currently the cheapest in the world (or one of the cheapest, as its unstable and can change daily). So if someone can earn dollars and spend it in Iran, they are going to profit a lot. We are talking close to 25x increase. This makes farming insanely profitable. Because you are going to pay for your electricity in Iranian currency, but you are earning dollars, because crypto exchange rate is based on western currencies, not Iranian. So electricity is dirt cheap to begin with, but you can get it even cheaper.

There are ways to get free electricity in Iran. The government subsidizes businesses that have high electricity usage, so they get publicly funded electricity. So the owner of these businesses makes deals with individuals to buy hardware needed to farm currency (because the initial cost is very high due to currency difference), and usually one person with contacts overseas becomes the ""broker"" to be able to turn these cryptos into tangible money.  People without these businesses tend to form farming communities where they work together to discreetly farm and turn crypto into actual currency and due to the fact that a lot of people are dealing in crypto now, you can actually find a lot of buyers locally, and don't even need to sell it to foreigners.

So, this way crypto got introduced into society and a lot of people use it. Usually not as an investment, but as a currency you use to spend on things. Because in order to make an international purchase, you need to abuse a lot of loopholes, such as VPNs, middlemen and exchange rates. But now I can simply buy steam gift cards with bitcoin and use them to buy games. This applies to any international purchase. 60$ games used to cost a fortune, like an entire minimum wage income in Iran. Now they are widely available if you have crypto.

The usual mishandling of the Iranian government in regards to the economy is bad enough, but in recent years sanctions and COVID have made it a three way hell. My life personally was hell because I could not make any international purchase and I could barely make ends meet. Crypto is so empowering. I am basically able to earn and spend money despite the efforts of both Iranian and American governments. In order to put things in perspective,¬†I can use myself as an example. I am a lawyer and I earn more money from farming that I do practicing law. I am still working,¬†but crypto is a great secondary income which I can use to make international purchases without having to pay half of my income for a 100$ purchase. We are still in bad conditions, but crypto provides a lifeline. At least for now.

I am grateful for cryptocurrency and this community, because the livelihood of many people in Iran relies on crypto and information about it. Most people involved in crypto trade in Iran don't even speak English, but know that an entire country is thankful for it, and the value of crypto could not be clearer. An entire people neglected by their own government and sanctioned by half the world, left to basically starve and live in terrible conditions, continue to go on. In large part, thanks to crypto currencies. We practically have the power to defy the strongest governments in the world, the next step is THE MOON.

This list contains only trusted services, without any referral codes.

If you think I missed something, please share it in the comments so that people can check that out as well!

&amp;#x200B;

**Coinbase Earn** **\[about $30 in different cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the most popular ways, although it is not really the quickest. You need a Coinbase account and to complete verification (so photo + document). Once you are verified, you will be put on a waiting list that usually lasts a couple of days. 

Once you get accepted, all you have to do is watch a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it. It is not anything hard and you can find the answers online.

Right now, you can earn XLM, COMP, CGLD, GRT, NU, but they often update it with a new project so definitely keep the account once verified.

[LINK](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)

&amp;#x200B;

**CoinMarketCap Earn** **\[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Basically the same as Coinbase Earn, but hosted by CoinMarketCap. For this, you'll need a CoinMarketCap account (just needs e-mail and password) and a verified Binance account (which requires verification, but there's no waiting list once verified). 

The payouts are slower than Coinbase Earn, since they are distributed after weeks and not immediately.

[LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Faucets \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get a small amount of crypto. You just need a wallet that can hold the coin and the relative address, and you're good to go.

They're basically websites that distribute small amounts of cryptos to the users asking for it, and they're supported by donations/ads and stuff like that.

There are a lot and you can often find them just by searching on Google ""&lt;name of the coin&gt; + faucet"".

A [good read](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet) about them and some examples: [freenanofaucet](https://www.freenanofaucet.com/) and [Doge Faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en)

&amp;#x200B;

**Airdrops \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. 

They can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.

Airdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bounties \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

In the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for ‚Äúbounties‚Äù. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. 

As you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.

&amp;#x200B;

**WeNano \[NANO\]:**

This is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.

Have you ever played Pok√©mon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pok√©mon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.

[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)

&amp;#x200B;

**NanoQuakeJs \[NANO\]:**

Another favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.

[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!

There are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reddit \[MOON, DOGE, NANO\]:**

Yeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.

First, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!

Other subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. 

Also, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.

&amp;#x200B;

**Publish0x \[ETH\]:**

This is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.

The best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).

[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

**SteemIt \[STEEM\]:**

Steemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.¬† 

It is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link

[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.

&amp;#x200B;

**NFT marketplaces \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. 

You can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can ""link"" it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.

[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Games and Collectibles \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.

Usually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!

Examples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).

Some aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)

&amp;#x200B;

Endnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.

TopWoodpecker7267,0.0,4702.0,"Full disclaimer: I own some ETH. I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.

&gt;What is happening?

* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/

* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.

&gt;Why is this happening?

 * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.

 * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.

&gt;How can I save money?

 * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money

 * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later

 * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)

&gt;What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)

 * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.

 * EIP-1559: Est ""this summer, but maybe Q3"": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving ""gas inflation"" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions

 * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until ""the merge"". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)

 * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. 

 * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today

 * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability

&gt;What other out-of-order improvements are coming?

 * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to ""get in"", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.

#The Elation  
For me, I kept talking to my good friend M about Bitcoin. He told me about it in September and through October to November we watched it sail past $10,000, to $15,000 before we decided to dip our toes. He was dead set on Ripple and bought at about $0.20, and was supposed to come over and show me how to set it up, but on his way over, he was T-boned by a careless driver and we postponed it. In the days after, Ripple shot up and I felt like I missed the boat, and he tipped me off about another good project called ""Cardano""  

*Oh, those merry times*  

I bought some in mid December, and let me tell you that what happened was absolutely insane. For starters, Coinbase was so fucked from the insane level of sign ups, that they couldn't process new accounts. It took **THREE WEEKS** for my account to be verified, and I had to buy Bitcoin from Local Bitcoins, transfer to Binance and then swap to Cardano. What a joke, but hey I got my Cardano. Little did we realise, we were just 1 month from the top. We enjoyed stratospheric gains for one month.  

It felt different than this February, where gains have been ridiculous. Back then, you could've put your money on nearly anything and 8-10x'd in a couple weeks flat. Someone on this reddit described it really well - your money doubled, then doubled again. You'd think ""Surely this is it"", then it doubled again. Finally, it doubled again. And then once more.  

I bought 2 days before the Bitcoin top. I had no idea what happens next.  

For the unaware, alts don't really go up when BTC goes up. Money flows out of alts, into BTC as it gains. When BTC dips, it takes the market with it. But BTC rising up doesn't really take the market up because there are so many who take money out of alts to ride BTC's wave. **The best time to be in alts, is when BTC goes flat**  

And that's kinda what happened. And alts exploded.  

My small Cardano buy doubled, and then doubled, and again and again. Every day I woke up to more green in the portfolio. My mate was making bank off Ripple - it went from 20c to over $3.00. I cursed myself for not just buying Ripple at 44c or whatever it was, and I bought some at $3.15 - basically the top of the market, Ripple's highest ever price.  

I also bought some bags. FunFair went mad, why not, I'll have some. Saw crazy profit on that. ETHLend going mad? Go on then. TRON? Go on then!  

There was no wrong decision in that frenzy.  

Until there was.  

#The Copium  
The gains leveled out. Some days started to get red. Everyone was saying shit like ""Chinese New Year"", ""Wall Street Bonuses"", ""Korea FUD"". Nobody can pin why the bubble popped, but in any assets history, such an incredible period of growth just cannot be sustained. I think it was South Korea basically taking some exchanges offline and it fucked with Coin Stat websites. People panicked and sold. That caused more panic, and more sales.  

The daily gains turned red, very quickly.  

""It's just a dip"" ""Hold!"" ""We need a correction"" was the hopium of the day. Anyone ballsy enough sold, probably everyone who had been in this space since 2016. They'd seen it all before.  

Some coins slowly turned from green, to breakeven, to red.  

And it just kept going down. I remember a brief rally in April. It was a suckers rally, in May my altcoins were mostly back in profit. It went down again. Same thing in August, BTC spiked up, we all thought ""Finally, this is it!"" and then it came back down again. Over and over.

Small blips aside, the Bitcoin bear market lasted from Mid December 2018 to Mid March 2020. That's 15 months, and only then did it start rising properly. We had a false start in early 2019 after the babyish chain split of Bitcoin Cash into BCH and BSV, which plummeted the market into one of the lowest prolonged periods of red I have seen. At this point, many people were down some -80% to -95%, me included.  

#The Effect  
How did it feel? Well to be honest, weird. But it happened over such a long period of time, you just become numb to it. In fact, after periods where your portfolio barely moves 3% in a week, you actually come to enjoy the wild volatility, even when the arse is falling out of it.  

It never stops though, in October 2018, we experienced one of the sharpest in memory, when a childish squabble between Roger Ver and Craig Wright forked the Bitcoin Cash chain into BCH and Bitcoin ""Satoshi's Vision"" (christ)  

This resulted in an absolutely gut-wrenching drop which lasted until early 2019.  

Some days, the losses and gains really did affect my day to day. I've received a couple warnings from work about chart-watching and I've been snappy or elated depending on how much I lost or gained in a day. Now I just truly don't care. I have a target and if I get there, good, if not, I'll wait.

#Is that a light I see?  
2019 started out quite nicely. Price remained stable in the $3,000's until April, where it all started climbing back up again. Alts came along for the ride too. On the summer solstice, BTC broke past $10,000. I smiled as I checked my portfolio, the same day I proposed to my gorgeous fiancee *(that covers my ass in case she reads this)*. Were things looking up?  

Myeh, not quite. This period of &gt;$10,000 lasted until about September and we came back down. Again, a quiet Christmas and then the hope of a new year brought prices up again just nosing past $10,000.  

Up to this point, I had been buying a bunch of stuff. I bought some Golem, it tripled in one of those spikes in 2018 and then I held a worthless token. My ETHLend, Funfair and Tron were basically worthless. The only times I was in profit was when Cardano, Eth or Ripple stirred from their sleep.  

My first Bitcoin buy, to actually buy and keep, was in fuckin November 2019. I set up a monthly buy, but then stopped halfway through 2020 - with Coronavirus, I could've been out of work at a moments notice so all crypto buying stopped.  

In March 2020, we saw Crypto nosedive as Coronavirus struck. This one sucked. In hindsight, these prices were a **fucking steal** - I had the balls to put only one buy in, Cardano at $0.035 and $0.038 - last week, these appreciated 31x and 27x respectively.  

And that was basically the bottom. All has risen from there.  

I made some massive, massive mistakes. I held certain shitcoins way too long, and sold ETHLEND when I broke even on it, because I didn't do any research and didn't get why it was climbing so quickly, which ultimately cost me about $4,500 in wasted gains.

I think the best thing I did was consolidate my entire portfolio. All the shit from Coinbase Earn, I just moved it all into Stellar. All the other crap, I just tied it into the good projects and Bitcoin.  

So does this current dip feel like that bear market? No. It just feels like a correction on the way to something bigger. But I do think we will see, until June, some sideways and mostly negative price action broken up with a few days of gains at a time.  

Some cardinal rules for Crypto:  

* This market is fucking irrational. It doesn't make sense that EOS enjoyed periods of insane growth after the network was basically so congested it was not functional, or after people found out that 98% of the transactions on the network was just blocks filling up with weather data from around the world...  
* Do not ever, **ever** leverage yourself to buy Crypto. I'm talking loans, credit card debt, spending money reserved for rent or mortgage. This market can and will change in the blink of an eye and it's not worth the risk.  
* **Time in the market** is truly better than **timing the market**. I tried trading a handful of times and it was a fantastic way of basically just setting fire to my money. I think my most successful trade I earned about 20 ""free"" ADA. The worst trade I did, I lost about ¬£50 before I figured fuck it.  
* Do some fucking research! I mentioned earlier, I sold ETHLEND before it transformed into AAVE. I sold at $0.12. At it's peak, it was worth about $5.40. It annoys me nearly every fucking day.  
* We are early. Yeah, we really are. Someone on here mentioned that most people can't even tell you what Bitcoin is or does. Get in, stay in. Ride until you can take out your principal and the rest is free money.  
* Don't take it so seriously. This shit definitely affected my day-to-day. You need to learn to let it go and roll with the punches. I put in a marginal amount maybe once a month and it still felt horrible the first few times I saw deep red in the portfolio.

pseudoHappyHippy,0.0,3541.0,"Someone in the daily said they couldn't wrap their mind around stop limit orders, so I replied to them with what ended up being a rather massive explanation for the 3 types of orders in the post title. I think a lot of beginners (both in the stock market and crypto) struggle with these concepts, so I thought I would post the entire explanation as a guide. So, here it is!

Ok, so there are **limit orders**, **stop orders**, and **stop-limit orders**. The third one combines the concepts of the first two.

Let's start with a sell **limit order.** Perhaps you hold a bunch of some asset currently at $1. You decide that if it hits $1.50, you want to sell. So you make a limit sell order. This is simply an order that will be automatically triggered at the first opportunity to sell at or above the limit price you chose, $1.50. It will only fill if you can get a price equal to or better than the limit price. You're basically publishing an offer to the world, saying ""if ever anyone wants to buy at $1.50 or higher, I am down, and my computer will automatically do the trade with you"".

But imagine you also want to automatically sell if it gets to $0.50 or lower, because you believe that would indicate free fall and you'd want to just cut your losses. A sell limit order wouldn't work here, because a limit order is triggered so long as it can be filled at the limit price or better. So, if you set a sell limit for $0.50 while the price is currently $1.00, it would be instantly triggered and your position would be sold at $1.00, because $1.00 satisfies the condition of being equal to or better than the $0.50 limit price. So, this doesn't do what you want. That's were stop orders (aka stop-losses) come in. A **stop order** will trigger a sell at the best available market price once the stop price has been reached. So, if you set the stop price to $0.50, then once the market price passes below that threshold, your position will be sold at the best available market price in that moment (which will usually be very very close to the stop price you set).

So, here is the difference between a limit order and a stop order: in a limit order, the limit price is just a threshold above which you will accept a trade and below which you will not. It's basically like an open offer to sell at some price. With a stop order, the stop price is not a threshold below which you will accept a trade. Instead, it is a trigger: once the market price passes your stop price, then your position will be sold instantly to the highest bidder in that moment.

Now, this means that usually your position will be sold basically right at the stop price (or very close, like $0.4998), because if your position is being sold to the highest bidder the moment the price touches your stop price, the highest bidder will basically be buying at the stop price. However, there are exceptions.

For example, in the stock market, there is after-hours trading when you can't trade, but special people can. Now, imagine the day closes with the price at $0.55, and your stop price is $0.50. During after hours, a bunch of whales dump the stock, and by open tomorrow morning, it is at $0.20. Your stop loss will be instantly triggered and you will sell at $0.20, not $0.50 like you wanted. This is because the triggering event of the market price passing your stop price happened (during after hours), so the position was sold at the earliest possible time at the highest available price, which happened to be at market open the next day at $0.20.

Another example is this: imagine a gigantic whale decides to sell an absurd amount of your crypto just a tiny bit above your stop loss price, at like $0.501. This triggers a massive selloff and the price drops off a cliff. It therefore drops past your stop price, so automatically you get in line to sell at the highest available price. But the demand to buy at $0.50 has already come and gone, and there aren't enough buyers to keep up with the sellers, so by the time your transaction actually gets filled, it ends up being at $0.45, not $0.50. This is called price slippage, by the way.

A third example: imagine your exchange goes down for 10 minutes when the price is at $0.52, but once it comes back 10 minutes later, the price is at $0.25, since other exchanges were running during those 10 minutes. Now your stop order will be filled at $0.25. Not ideal.

This finally brings us to the **stop limit.** The stop limit combines both limit orders and stop losses. They require that you specify two prices: the stop price, and the limit price. If the market price passes the stop price, that triggers the creation of a limit order with the limit price you specified. Let's consider a couple cases where you might want to use this.

Let's say, like before, you believe if the price gets as low as $0.50, then that signals that you need to exit. However, you are definitely not willing to sell below $0.30. You would rather just hold and hope it recovers one day than sell that low. So, you make a stop limit order where the stop price is $0.50 and the limit price is $0.30. The moment the price gets as low as $0.50, the stop will be triggered, which will then create a limit order whose limit price is $0.30. So, the stop price is the trigger to decide you want to make a sell offer, and the limit price is the lowest you are willing to sell for once the stop trigger actually happens. 99% of the time, this stop limit order will mean you end up selling basically right at $0.50, just like the stop order we talked about earlier. Once the stop price is passed, your limit order will be created for $0.30, which will immediately be filled at like $0.499, because that is the current price, and it satisfies the condition of the limit order, which is to sell at or above the limit price of $0.30. However, in the off-chance that your stop price is triggered at $0.50, but the price then somehow teleports down to $0.25 (after hours trading, price slippage, or your exchange going down) then your position would not be sold, because the price is below the limit price you set. If the price eventually recovered to $0.30, your position would then be sold at that price, if you hadn't cancelled it by then.

Another use case would be this. Say, once again, you believe that if the price drops below $0.50, that is a red flag that you should exit your position. However, you believe that if it does get that low, there is a very good chance that there will be a dead cat bounce (where something makes a short-lived partial recovery while it is in its death throes). You bet that, if this coin gets as low as $0.50, it will briefly make it back up to $0.70 before crashing fully and dying. So, you make a stop limit order with $0.50 stop price, and a $0.70 limit price. If ever the price gets as low as $0.50, you will now automatically publish an offer to sell at $0.70 (ie: a limit order with $0.70 limit price will be created). If the price now rebounds up to $0.70 like you thought it would, your order will be filled and you will sell at $0.70. If it doesn't end up rebounding that high, your order won't be filled, and you'll end up holding. It's like saying ""I believe if we go as low as $0.50, that's a good indication we are crashing hard, so I will try to exit at $0.70 shortly thereafter during a bounce, but if I can't get that good of a deal, I guess I'll just hold and hold and hope it recovers one day"".

So, in summary: A **limit order** is an open offer to sell at a certain price or better that you publish to the market. A **stop order** is a trigger threshold, which, if passed, means your position will be sold ASAP at current market price. A **stop limit order** is a trigger threshold, which, if passed, creates a limit order.

Finally, I want to note that all these examples have to do with selling, but these types of orders exist for buying as well. It works the same way, but everything is flipped. For example, if you want to buy a coin, but only if it dips below $0.25 so that it's affordable to you, then you would make a limit buy order with $0.25 as the limit price, and you would automatically buy that position if ever someone is willing to sell at that price (ie: the market price dips that low).

In the immediate term the plan is to reward the top five meme posts in terms of upvotes that sub has at the end of each week UTC time with MOONs from the mod/community pot in the amount of 400, 250, 150, 100, 50 MOONs. In the medium term, let's say a month or two, we are hoping that we can define a way for these rewards to come directly from the monthly MOON distribution. We have had some preliminary discussion about this with admins and they seem onboard but would like to see the community define a distribution governance proposal and pass it to define exactly how this would be done.

Thanks to A LOT OF WORK obviously, a few successful trades, airdrops and especially the daily reading of the Reddit forums (which made me keep hope in the Long Winter), I managed to settle the last debt a few weeks ago.

I was inspired by the post from the guy who became a millionaire thanks to crypto, and I'd like to celebrate this little victory with you too!

EDIT: Some updates answering most asked questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Yeah, I paid the taxes.
2. About jumping out in a bull market:

I know, but I couldn't wait any longer... the bank I owed wouldn't open a checking account that became necessary because of a business contract. I have 2 employees depending on this contract. =\]

3. Some highlights of these 3 years:

Please, this is not a financial advice.

I started reading a lot about BTC and other top10 coins. Invested in some alts because, for me back in 2017, BTC was also too high at 10-20k.

So, I picked up coins with a good product/idea and company/team behind it. Examples are: IOTA, XRP (at least in my first readings), XMR. Because I joined in quite early, I didn't lose money with XRP, for example, but I did with IOTA (because of the timing).

In the bear market, I put some money in BTC as well -- monthly, yeah. Then, started to look for microcap projects, such as BOMB, Parachute token, Uptrennd, XIO etc. Making part of these microcap communities is a good way to make some extra and know some good people. Of course, be very aware of scams.

Today, I wish I could have done some things different:

1. Don't fall in love with an asset (and sell or exchange them for profit);
2. Bitcoin is the most resillient coin around, so it would be much less stressful if I had more BTC instead of alts;
3. Don't be too greedy and profit all over the bullrun;
4. DCA is the best strategy, as most of you pointed out;
5. Don't hodl when the bear market starts (these were the longest 3 years in my life lol). I would sell everything back in Q1 2018 to return months or years later.

tiredasfuckreally,0.0,2818.0,"My life changed because of one silly post that I came across on reddit. It was a pic of someone holding up their paper wallet from a bitcoin atm showing both public and private keys. The picture made me wonder if there were any nearby bitcoin atms, so I did a quick google search and found an atm 20 minutes away from me. I went to the atm and put in 50$ just to say that I had some bitcoin. I signed up for /r/bitcoinbeginners and learned about Coinbase. After signing up with Coinbase, I started researching the ""other"" crypto being offered and learned about /r/cryptocurrency. I started buying eth at 8$ and eventually invested 30% of my net worth in crypto. 

I stuck with eth during lows &amp; highs and yes I do regret sometimes not selling at top during last bull run. This month I decided that I wanted to set a baseline on what I would get with my crypto investment. I sold enough eth and bitcoin to pay off the mortgage to my house and compensate for taxes. Today I went to the bank and turned in my final house payment. No matter what happens to crypto from here on out, I have a house. Paying off the house was never a goal for 2020. Hell, it wasn't even a goal for the next decade.

Do I think ETH will hit above $1400 again? Yes, and it might happen next week or next year or half a decade. I've never doubted the technology. However, getting rid of my mortgage takes an immediate, priceless weight off my shoulders. I work in an industry where layoffs always seem to be on the horizon, and it's hard to get a job when everyone is out of a job. Now I don't have to worry about keeping a roof over my family's head. The relief is euphoric.

I'm not completely off the crypto ride. I still have a good amount of eth left. I'm going to invest a small amount per month back into eth and bitcoin to slowly build my stockpile back up, but I'm not in any rush. I'd like to thank this sub as well as many others for all the knowledge, advice, and entertainment.

dado3,0.0,2474.0,"tl;dr version: The dips are market manipulations by institutional players. Don't panic sell, and think carefully about where you set your stop-losses at least until the $100K mark. 

So I keep seeing people compare this bullrun to 2013 or 2017. But they're wrong. Unlike the inherently speculative nature of the previous runs, this is an accumulative run driven by institutions and high-wealth individuals. They think and act differently, and you need to know the difference.

You may have noticed a pattern of late that an ATH is reached, and then it immediately pulls back significantly. I see people putting it down to ""corrections"" or ""dips"" that you normally see but it's not. It's an intentional market manipulation by those big players.

The problem that they're running into is that there simply isn't enough BTC on the market at any given time to satisfy the needs of the institutions themselves and the clients they serve. They have to find ways to pump liquidity into the market, so this is what they're doing. 

They don't care about short-term trading losses. They're dumping large amounts of BTC in the form of BTC and derivatives to drive down the prices and trigger stop-losses and panic selling. BTC that would otherwise be safely locked up are being released onto the market, and they're snapping them up at (relatively) bargain basement prices.

Then what happens afterward? They've now sucked all the possible liquidity out of the market. It's gone. Everyone they can possibly induce to sell has sold. Which leaves only those waiting for higher prices to sell. And so we hit a new ATH, rinse and repeat.

So how will we be able to tell when it's a real ""dip"" or ""correction."" They've already told us. JPMorgan says their target is $146K. Citi says $300K. And if players like JPM and Citi have set targets, you can bet the others have too. We just don't know where they are. A safe bet is somewhere in between those two numbers.

JPM probably won't wait for $146K to stop buying, and Citi's not going to wait for $300K. If I had to place a guess, I'd say somewhere that would leave them at least a 10% gain (which would be better than an average year investing in the S&amp;P500). That places JPM's # somewhere around $130K and Citi at $270K. Until we're safely past $100K at the very least, they're not going to stop.

mortuusmare,0.0,2449.0,"So we‚Äôre all aware of the Uniswap airdrop that took place earlier this year, where some lucky folk woke up to over $1200 worth of UNI dropped to them in their wallet ‚Äì worth over $3,000 at its peak ‚Äì simply for interacting with the Uniswap platform prior September 1st 2020. I wasn‚Äôt one of these fortunate few and neither were a lot of other people here. I‚Äôd see people asking if they were too late for the airdrop, or if there were any other airdrops similar. This gave me an idea:- take part in as many airdrops as possible and see how many had any value to them and report back. The answer may seem obvious to some, but I wanted to evidence it. 

The task was simple, enter ‚Äòcryptocurrency airdrops‚Äô into a search engine and see what came up. This eventually led me to joining several airdrop telegrams and twitter accounts and after a week or so I had applied for 14 airdrop by mid October. 

These projects almost universally required the user to join the project‚Äôs telegram group as well as like and retweet a post on the project‚Äôs twitter account and follow them. Some would ask you to join their Facebook or Medium page and some would require you to post about them and tag friends in. Needless to say, I used throwaway accounts and didn't take part in any that required to tag someone else. Nearly all of them touted themselves as the next big thing in decentralized finance. These were the projects and what they advertised:

**Name**|**Airdrop**|**Adv. $ value**
:--|:--:|:--:
ArbiSwap | 1000 Aswap | $30
UniSwapx | 500 UNIX | $500
Imperium PB | 100 IPBA | $50
YFIV Finance | 1 YFIV | $360
CryptoTechGiants | 50 USDT | $50
Universe Token | 500 UNIT | $500
yToken Finance | 0.2 YTKN | $4
CeliSwap | 500 CSP | $500
XUNII.Finance | 200 XUNII | $20
Revo Finance | 1.5 RVF | $28.90
Ybull Finance | 0.2 YBULL | $10
YFDiamond | 1 YFD | $25
Xenon Token | 5000 XNT | $50
dEarn Finance | 70 DFI | $700

Now, those of you who have been here a while will know exactly where this thread is going. To others, this should confirm their suspicions. Telegram is abbreviated to 'TG'.

**Name**|**Received**|**What Happened**
:--|:--:|:--
ArbiSwap | 0 Aswap | You had to pay them $2 for gas to get airdrop worth $1.34 (worth $1.11 as of now)
UniSwapx | 0 UNIX | **Airdrop never arrived**, locked their TG whilst heavily pushing presale
Imperium PB | 0 IPBA | **Airdrop never arrived**, Telegram channel locked 2 days before airdrop
YFIV Finance | 0 YFIV | **Airdrop never arrived** but still heavily pushing presale even now
CryptoTechGiants | 0 USDT | Airdrop turned into a competition based on how many people you could refer, TG channel turned into a *signal group* (A.K.A P&amp;D group)
Universe Token | 0 UNIT | **Airdrop never arrived**. Locked their TG and advertised a doubling ETH scam website to their users
yToken Finance | 0 YTKN | **Airdrop never arrived**. TG locked and then sold to 'BinanceSwap'
CeliSwap | 0 CSP | TG locked. Required 0.09 ETH (then $45) to be sent which ""they would send back""
XUNII.Finance | 0 XUNII | **Airdrop never arrived**. TG locked and now advertises other 'airdrops'
Revo Finance | 0 RVF | **Airdrop never arrived** due to ""high gas fees"". No one bought their presale so they created a poll asking why. Still pushing presale
Ybull Finance | 0 YBULL | **Airdrop never arrived**. Locked and ghosted their TG channel before airdrop
YFDiamond | **0.00005 YFD** | They airdropped 0.00005 YFD out of the 1 YFD advertised. TG locked and now advertises other 'airdrops'
Xenon Token | 0 XNT | **Airdrop never arrived**. Deleted their TG channel 
dEarn Finance | 0 DFI | You had to send 0.05 ETH ($25) to them first to 'validate' your address

So. out of a combined **$2,827.90** worth of cryptocurrencies advertised to be airdropped, only one 'project' actually airdropped anything and that was 0.005% of what was advertised which is currently worthless. 

This wasn't a surprise to myself and I am glad to have the actual data to back up my suspicions. 

**FINDINGS:**

 - Based on the Telegram channels of these 'projects', most of the users were from South America and the Middle East. Presumably from impoverished countries trying to find themselves some income.  
 - These 'airdrops' were almost always a front to peddle a presale of their token. This appears to be the primary goal of most of them. They want to sell their newly-minted tokens for ETH, promising their project will get listed on big exchanges 'Soon‚Ñ¢'.
 - I only had to provide an email to one project: ArbiSwap. I used a throwaway email. After a couple of weeks I started to receive unsolicited emails from unrelated projects. This indicates that they shared/sold information of their users to other 'projects'.
 - Some of the Telegram channels have been renamed and wiped of all information. The dEarn has been labelled a scam by Telegram themselves. Another has wiped all info and has renamed itself 'Project for Sale' and have made one post stating ""We couldn't raise enough from presale, so we abandon the project"". I am unable to find out which 'project' this channel belonged to. 
 - Some projects seem to work together and promote the other project to their users on TG and twitter. 
 - Airdrop twitter accounts and telegrams don't always promote the same airdrops, indicating that they only advertise airdrops that they're paid to advertise by the 'project'. 

**To any newcomers to the cryptosphere, please do your research before taking part in any airdrops. Your time is worth more than most of these 'projects' combined. If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.**",CryptoCurrency,"So I took part in 14 airdrops reportedly worth '$2,827.90'..",2449.0,0.99

To advocate such a totaliarian position - where running a software node that operates according to an autonomous algorithm becomes illegal in the United States - means he is profoundly authoritarian in his mindset and agenda.

Ultimately his goal must be to either keep all cryptocurrency networks out of the US through extreme control over the internet within the US, or to eliminate all autonomous cryptocurrency networks from the world.

This would disenfranchise millions of people, and prevent the emergence of decentralized financial networks that have already shown they have the ability to dramatically improve the living conditions of people facing some of the most challenging socioeconomic conditions in the world.

To advocate for such a heavy-handed and illiberal respose to a voluntarily formed decentralized software network makes it completely inappropriate for an international organization like the UN, or a world renowned university like Stanford, to have any affiliation with him.

He's advocating nothing less than the total suppression of non-official human activity, and total bureaucratic supremacy, of the kind characteristic of the worst totalitarian societies.

daranma,0.0,2102.0,"Hi all, I work in the Finance industry and have been trading stocks and crypto for years now. I would like to share some of my tips and knowledge here, hope you like them! 

Guides:

Stick to your personal trading rules and ignore noise/hype. 

Don't FOMO into a coin. Price always pulls back so never chase the pump and never buy at the top. If there's nothing to buy. Wait for a good entry. Let the pump come back to you. 

Expectation: you won't get rich overnight. After buying a coin, don't expect it to double overnight. Just be very patient with a coin before considering selling it. Just remind yourself why you bought the coin in the first place! 

The crypto market is unpredictable, anything could happen. 

I wouldn't recommend leverage trade/ shorting now - We're in a bull market now so it's not wise to take extra risk to leverage trade or short the market. 

Remember: most traders lose money, and the richest people in the world you know are long term investors, not traders. 

I have made much more money by investing mid-long term than going 20x on trades thinking I'll get rich overnight. 

We're in the middle of a bull market now and I don't think we're at the top yet. There's still money to be made but don't expect you can 100x your money, though I believe 10x is still quite possible. 

On that note, just focus on finding your 10x coins rather than aiming for a 100x moon coin, it's just unrealistic now. The time to make 100x is gone. Prepare to buy in the next bear market to prepare for the next bull cycle, that's how people make 100x.

Exit strategy:

While it's fun and exciting when we're in the middle of a bull run. But remember, this bull market won't last forever. While it's good to take advantage of this opportunity to make life changing money, don't forget to plan your exit strategy. Always remember to take profits. 

For example: if you're lucky enough to make 10x. Take some out and put it in Btc/ Eth for long term investments. Take some out to a stable coin so you can rotate the profits into another 10x coin. Take some out to fiat so you can enjoy your money. Leave 5-10% in the original coin in case it will still moon. Have a plan! 

Know when to sell:

Write down your price target when you buy a coin so you can ignore noise, FOMO and emotions down the track. When the coin is approaching your price target then start shaving off the profits. Remember: you don't have to sell the whole thing, you can always sell 10%‚Äî20% to take some profit out. 

You can dollar cost average in, and you can always dollar cost average out.

Above is not financial advice.

Thanks guys for reading. Hope the above helps and hope we all get rich.

Also I never shared this story before and wasn't really planning to, but I told it to one of my now close friend who is a crypto nerd like me and he said it was inspiring and that I should share it so here goes.

It's 2014 I am working a minimum wage job at a labels factory, I boxed the finished labels. 6 months later, I am promoted and I am head of the quality assurance department (happened super fast and everyone was amazed that it happened including myself :P ). I got a raise and life was good.One day the owner decided to hire a ""team leader"" basically a tier 2 boss.  An authoritarian racist c\*nt that hates my guts. We get in an argument, I turn my back on him and walk away and he ends up physically assaulting me for it. I threaten to sue and they fire me because of it.

I complain to the EEOC, because I can't afford a lawsuit. We mediate and like an idiot I settled for 5k they offered me. I Payed my lawyer $400, Bought us a new furnace because ours was old and had broke down. I replace the kitchen sink, paint the house and did some other minor repairs.

All said and done, and after working for nearly 2 years at that company I am unemployed, depressed and have nothing to show for it, Well except for a $1000 I have left from the settlement that I wanted to preserve and invest in something instead of spending it.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend a couple month of freelancing and hustling trying to find a new source of income. And one day I am on some random forum trying to find a solution to a problem I have with my code (I have 13+ years of programming experience C++, C#, Asm and reverse engineering) I read the word Bitcoin for the first time ever. And the person talking about it made it sound like it's the next big thing and that it's going to do wonders for apps and payment systems.

Other replies to that same post were talking about how it will make them all rich. I got curious, And on September, 2015, I google Bitcoin for the first time ever and I end up on Coinbase. I bought $5 worth of Bitcoin for shit's and giggles. Forgot about it for \~3 months. Then came back and sold it in October for $5.10. So I made 10 cents profit after coinbase's outrageous fees. And I thought to myself, This is great, I just made 2% with minimal effort. Greed kicked in and I started my quest to learn as much as I can about BTC.

For the skeptics:

Next thing I know I am on Coinbase Pro (Gdax at the time) and was instantly hypnotized by the insane volatility and price swings. I immediately start buying and selling, Without any knowledge about trading whatsoever. I made some money then then lost more than I made and now I have \~$820 left and I realized I am not going to beat the market like this. My orders were being front ran by bots (didn't know they were bots at the time) because they keep burying my limit orders whenever I post them and I don't get filled. Also fees for market orders were exceeding my profit so I end up losing instead of making money.

Thinking like a programmer (a problem solver really) I thought to myself there has to be a way for me to do the front running. I do some googling. Learn about the exchange API. I fired up Visual Studio, downloaded some files/libraries and spent a few weeks creating a prototype that would speed things up and give me an edge. At first I used C# and it looked like crap but it performed well, And with the ability to place orders as fast as possible (and free limit orders). My balance started growing.

Slowly but surely I kept improving the prototype over the years and it evolved into a fully functional trading platform. I eventually used Directx to recreate the order books locally (this part happened much later 2019-ish) because the exchange kept freezing and crashing when I needed it the most and low and behold, I had out done myself and created a fine trading platform [Here is the post were I first showed it to the world.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gqu05z/my_custom_made_desktop_crypto_trading_platform/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Here is a video of it in action too: [https://streamable.com/3jl30l](https://streamable.com/3jl30l)

&amp;#x200B;

One click insta buy/sell and everything was pre-calculated for me. All I had to do was pre-set the # of lots I wish to flip in each trade and click either the buy or sell buttons.

&amp;#x200B;

Within a few weeks of the first prototype I was up from $800 to 8k scalping BTC's volatile market and I was ecstatic, I was over the moon, pun intended. However, The market was slowing down and it is now boring and I am not making any $$ and I was never happy that I could only trade BTC and LTC on Coinbase and was scared to trade anywhere else for fear of losing my money with all the hacks and scams that were happening almost everyday. But then I learn about a coin called Lisk. And the Lisk zealots managed to convert me and I end up joining them and opened a Bittrex account lol.

&amp;#x200B;

By now I had spent 3k in life expenses and I have 5k left so I move it to Bittrex, And add Bittrex to my trading platform and go all in on Lisk at $3. I was convinced it is going to the moon and will make me rich. I go to my wife and beg her to borrow some money from her dad for me or max out a credit card or whatever the fuck she can do to get me a few more thousand dollars so that I could add more to my LSK position because I have no credit score history and no one would lend me, She was terrified and refused to help me. I didn't get a single dime. (Hindsight, I am glad she didn't :P)

&amp;#x200B;

So there I was, Angry at my wife (I was wrong I know) determined to prove her wrong and show her that this will work and that I am not going to lose so I am trading like a degenerate gambler with my entire stack. Looking like a zombi from malnutrition and lack of sleep, But I pull through and grow that 5k into \~24k within roughly 1.5 months. Phew, I DID IT, I shout. looking at my wife. I FUCKING DID IT. I TOLD I CAN DO IT but you never believed in me. And my head grew bigger and bigger to the point were it wouldn't fit through the door any more. Meanwhile LTC is pumping like a mother fucker but I had no idea because I am not paying attention to anything else but my cash cow LISK. Now that LISK is slowing down (Re-branding delayed) and hype was dead. I sell it all. Transfer the cash back to Gdax and join the LTC frenzy.

By now it's December 2017, And shit was Insane, It was lit, Everything was on steroids and $ signs everywhere. I was going all in on every trade (Spot trading) and with every trade and my account kept growing. First it was growing hundreds, Then LTC went parabolic and it was thousands of $$ with every click of the mouse. Every click of the buy/sell buttons I made or lost a few thousand $$. Never holding on to a position loser or winner. I catch the wicks (which were huge) and would flip it in seconds just to go back to fiat for fear of getting whipsawed and losing it all.

&amp;#x200B;

By now I had grown my 24k into 100k within like 3 days at the markets peak (LTC at like $150+). The joy I felt, The happiness, The pride :) I was victorious and those 3 days were like a crazy epic dream.

So now I am gloating and teasing my wife telling her how I did it all by myself and shit and thanking her for all the help she didn't offer. meanwhile, LTC is still pumping like crazy. But I was content, I had just broken the 100k mark and was ready to celebrate. but of-course life is never sunshine and rainbows.

&amp;#x200B;

To my dismay, My wife asks. What about TAXES?  I am like what taxes? I already payed the fees! (I am a foreigner so i knew nothing about taxes in the US of A) She said you have to pay capital gain taxes on this, It's like 30%. My face turned pale and my heart skipped a beat, I jump out of bed, go online and research capital gain taxes.

And I realized she was right, I am going to end up paying at least 25% to 32% of my money in taxes. I felt like I wanted to cry and all the joy and happiness I had felt was gone (Hindsight I should have been happy even after taxes :P). But I decided to push forward and make the 32% that I have to pay in taxes to get to the 100k mark after taxes while the market is hot.

so I cancelled the moon party and went back upstairs, Started the computer and started trading again.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am back at it, Still killing it making more and more money. This continues for a day or 2 more and by the time the crypto party was over and when LTC started the big crash from $400 to $150 I was all back in cash and I had made a grand total of 310k+ and 105k+ trades in about 6 months, Most trades were made in Dec 2017 and Jan 2018 on BTC, LTC and LSK combined.

&amp;#x200B;

I at first protested paying taxes for weeks, No for months, because it seemed unfair to me. But the April 15th deadline drew ever closer. And our CPA scared me str8 telling me about all the fees and fines I would have to pay if I delay paying the IRS so I reluctantly agreed and paid all of my taxes to uncle Sam. It was a massive chunk of money to give away all at once and it made me sick to the stomach.

&amp;#x200B;

And that my friends is the long-short version of the story of how I turned a $1000 into $300k. I hope to one day be able to tell a story of how I turned whatever I have left of the 300k now into a million $ or even better into a multi million dollar fortune :)

I know some people did like 1000x better than me, But for my story, I am proud of what I had achieved so far and I thought it would be cool to share the story and to hear other peoples success stories.

I still am still doing great in this bull market and trading crypto has been my full time job ever since I got fired from my job at the labels factory. I have grown a lot since. btw I thought about sending the owner of the factory that fired me a letter thanking him for firing me because it was the best thing that ever happened to me but I never did :P

&amp;#x200B;

If you have made it this far. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, And wish you and everyone else the best of luck and riches beyond your wildest dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I turned a $1000 I got from a EEOC settlement into $300k+ scalping LSK and LTC back in 2017 bull market.

So I knew the developers didn't account for this shit when they released PayPal Crypto so I submitted the stuff for review with my photo ID and wrote ""PayPal Crypto"" for each crypto transaction BECAUSE WHAT ELSE could I say?

I called their phone and he said he's expedited the review. I went to sleep, the next day (today) my account is permanently limited due to ....

No appeals. No explanation. No consideration that their reviewer may be an ignorant 60 year old with no knowledge of PayPal's own crypto service. Whenever I've called their support about PayPal Crypto in the past they had no idea what I was talking about (even after weeks after release).

Now I haven't called yet because phone support is offline, but I'm writing this thread because many others will be in the same spot as I am.


How do we start our journey to get them to understand what the fuck they did. I genuinely 100% know I did nothing wrong and its a misunderstanding because they think I made  50+ buy/sell transactions in a span of 1 week of items, when its just crypto.

I know how bad PayPal is in resolving these things and I've used them regularly for everything.

------------

***EDIT EDIT EDIT :***

I just spent 40 minutes on the phone with a nice lady (Jennifer) on PayPal's phone and went through our transaction history/activity, tons of explanations of crypto terms (since she didn't know PayPal even has crypto) and I basically begged for the account back, but **still no luck because apparently you cannot appeal a final reviewed decision.**  

She genuinely wanted to help me and I believe she understood how crazy this ban was because I didn't sell items to anyone except PayPal (PayPal shows as the buyer and seller when you purchase from 'PayPal Crypto'). She finally understood it was a daytrading like thing and even after that there's no appeal option (she tried) and its final.

My last try would be to spam twitter, file consumer financial bureau mistakes and make coindesk-like articles to spread information and save others.

There is no real justice for the innocents in some places in the world.

But have you consistently been so bad at crypto that it made you laugh out loud and call yourself a dummy? So I thought it'd be cathartic to go down memory lane and write down my painful crypto story, which, as the post title says, is pretty much a textbook guide of what NOT to do. You can read, laugh and who knows, maybe even learn something.

&amp;nbsp;

1) I bought the literal top in December 2017. You know that running joke in crypto how a coin tanks as soon as you buy it? My first BTC buy was on December 16th 2017. Check the charts. I sometimes wonder if I single-handedly fucked the market.


2) I initially bought BTC and ETH. As I was an early adopter of the ""buy high sell low"" philosophy, I panic sold my BTC shortly after. Then I proceeded to use my precious ETH to chase pumps and shilled shitcoins, signing up left and right on obscure exchanges in the process, and you guessed it, always buying the top of trending alts. To name a few of my shiny early acquisitions: BNTY, DBC, PRL. Thanks /r/cryptocurrency daily discussions!


3) In my everlasting quest to being a super early adopter and smarter than everyone, I had an ICO phase. What's an ICO phase you ask? That's when you share a photo of your passport and your face with complete strangers on the Internet (KYC process, for those unfamiliar), in order to obtain the privilege to invest in their Initial (Shit)Coin Offering, supposedly at bottom price, before they're listed on any exchanges, with little to no guarantees that they're even legit. 
I did however always do diligent research: I ensured the project websites had cool animations and logos, that they used words like ""industry-disruptive"", and that their subreddit top 10 posts of all times had at least 9 hysterical price predictions. What do I have to show for it? The pride to have sponsored the lavish lifestyle of some ""blockchain entrepreneurs"", and that my passport is probably used nowadays to rent hookers in Moldova.


4) I stayed too long involved in idealistic and promising, but dying projects (Elastos, Elix, HorizonState, FunFair, Babb). I am ashamed just writing those names down.


5) I bought literal scams, like XTRABYTES and SUBSTRATUM. I'm only missing BITCONNECT for scam bingo. If you guys have a bridge to sell, let me know, I might be interested.


6) The few successes I had, I was too greedy and didn't cash out any profits. I saw NANO do an 8X, then watched it crash back to below my buy price, with a surprised pikachu face all the way up, and all the way down. I by the way almost lost all my Railblocks in the Bitgrail disaster, but thankfully transferred them right before it happened (possibly my ""smartest"" move to date, completely accidental).


7) I screwed up some decimals when placing orders on IDEX, buying for way higher than market price.

8) I placed some buy orders that never filled because I had set them as Limit instead of Market. God I've done this so many times. I was once even so dumb that I contacted Binance customer service to ask why the order didn't fill‚Ä¶


9) During a coin swap process, I lost private wallet keys, and wrongly updated my passphrase.


10) I wasted so much in transfer fees moving coins in and out of MEW and between exchanges back and forth, most of the time for no good reason.


11) I signed up for all kinds of worthless airdrops that only filled my mailbox with spam.


12) And last but not least, the grand finale: I bought a ledger, but never used it! That's right, I was going be a millionaire, you see, I had to get ready to store all that digital gold. It's still in its plastic wrapping, in my bedside table drawer, staring at me like the [disappointed cricket fan meme](https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sarim-Akhtar.jpg) every time I open it.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, what I did right (I think):


&amp;nbsp;

- I DCAed for a while after the early 2018 crash. As it kept crashing, I eventually stopped throwing good money after bad.


- Whatever shitcoins I had that still had value, I converted them to serious projects like ETH and VET, and I held.


- I fucking stopped trading. How I thought this was something I could do, having literally zero experience on financial markets, is hilarious in retrospect.


- During the long winter bear, I looked at prices only weekly, and kept up to date with general news, but without obsessing. A bit like polishing your meat to an ex-girlfriend you stayed in good terms with, but without the tears.

- I did a lot of reading on crypto throughout the whole ordeal. It's fascinating and despite my financial misfortunes, I'm a firm believer in the future of crypto.


- I bought some ETH when it dropped to $150 early 2020.


- I'm the proud owner of 5000 DOGE.

&amp;nbsp;

Where am I now? Almost breaking even. It took more than three years in the red, but thanks to DCA, holding, and sticking to solid projects, I stayed afloat and it will eventually, hopefully, make up for all the stupid mistakes I made. When I finally break even, I'll reduce my position, keep some ETH, post on crypto forums what a boss I am for being in the green, and that will be the end of a rather long and agonizing learning experience.

&amp;nbsp;

Cryptocurrencies are open and permissionless. That's kinda the whole point. You can send money to anyone, anytime. You can trade on centralized platforms or directly peer-to-peer. It's totally up to you.

If some exchange prevents trading, you can always trade somewhere else. They can't stop decentralized networks. If you hold your own keys (cryptography that allows you to send and receive funds), you have freedom to do whatever you want with your money.

But... pump and dump groups are not good. r/CryptoCurrency is ***NOT*** a pump and dump group.

Cryptocurrencies have seen their fair share of pumps and dumps. The distributed nature of them mean that anyone can attempt these at any time. Experienced cryptocurrency traders are extremely familiar with them, since they happen all the time. It's normal to see random ""altcoins"" appreciate or depreciate more than 100% in a single day. That's normal here. Everything is 100x.

We encourage you to learn about cryptocurrencies and to take advantage of their freedom and censorship-resistant properties. But please, follow our rules. Us moderators take the role of preventing manipulation here (of all types) extremely seriously.

#Preamble 

Many people are hearing about crypto and want to buy in. Well, after a fair warning about the risks, it's always best to give them some guidance on what to look for if they're really eager to invest. 

In this post I'll try my best to note some of the simplest indicators anyone can look for when looking to open a long position on any coin. A very common mistake people make is to only look at a single indicator when buying cryptocurrency. But in reality, there's a multitude of indicators you should be looking into when buying in to any coin. So if a coin seems to be doing well in all of the indicators I'll list, then at the very least you're reducing your chances to get burned. 

#Bad FOMO

First, let's list some commonly heard misconceptions about what would make a coin a good buy: 

* *That coin only costs 0.02$? Buy it, it can 10x.*

* *This fell 50% today, buy it!*

* *This coin is rising like crazy, good chance to jump in for some profits.*

* *Everyone is talking about this coin so it must be good*


If taken individually, these are not great indications to open a long position on any coin, for reasons I'll try to explain in the following points. In the following part I'll try to put them in a list for the sake of simplicity. 

#Market Indicators &amp; historical data

## 1. **Look at the volumes** 

It's really important to look into if there's a solid market behind a coin. If current volumes are really small, then the price is very prone to manipulation. 

**How to look into this?** Go into Coinmarketcap or Coingecko and have a look at historical volumes by hovering on the charts at a coin's page. This is better to be done on a desktop computer/laptop. Phone/tablet doesn't work so well for getting info out of the chart. 

## 2. **Look at the coins in circulation and release schedule**
 
It's really important to look at how many coins there are, how many there will ever be, and how fast coins are released. This is one of the reasons why buying a coin based on it having a low price per coin alone isn't a good idea. If many coins are to be released in the near future, it's very much likely that there's going to be a lot of selling pressure from those earning them. And if a coin is in its early release phases, emission is likely to be happening at a higher rate, so from monetary terms, prices would stabilize once emission is reduced. 

**How to look into this?** Coinmarketcap shows the total coins in circulation currently, as well as the maximum amount of coins there will ever be. And they're a third party source so they largely have no incentive to lie. You can trust them over a coin's developers for instance. Too look into this on your own, go into a coin's page on Coinmarketcap. *Circulating Supply* means how many coins are released on the market right now. *Max Supply* means how many coins there can ever be. To look into how fast coins are released you can Google something like ""[coin name] emission schedule"". This should bring up some info on how a coin is planned to continue being 'minted'. It can vary a lot from coin to coin so always do your own research, find up to date sources and double check so you understand everything correctly. 

## 3. **Check the listings**

If a coin is only listed on very few exchanges, it's very much likely that it doesn't have a solid market behind it. Its price could be manipulated easily and when only a few exchanges trade a coin you should be suspicious of high volumes. 

**How to look into this?** Go to the Coinmarketcap page for a coin, click on ""Market"" and see the exchange pairs. Pay special attention at how the volumes are distributed and what the ""Confidence"" rating for each exchange says. If a coin is receiving most of its volumes on low rated exchange it might be a good idea to stay away. 

## 4. **Pair variety**

If a coin has a great variety of pairs to be traded with, it's a very good indicator that there's demand to trade with it. Especially if there are many FIAT pairs for it, across several exchanges, this is a great case for a coin having people interested in it worldwide. 

**How to look into this?** In the Coinmarketcap ""Market"" page for a coin, see how many different pairs there are. To look out for FIAT pairs more directly you can also filter pairs at the top right by selecting EUR or USD etc. You can also click ""Load More"" for a fuller picture.  

## 5. **Historical price**

This is perhaps the single most important indicator when going in to a coin. No matter if the price per coin looks low for example, if the coin is at an all time high when you're buying, then this is one indicator showing it's hard for the coin to go up further. You can also compare the current price with different time periods. For example, last 7 days, month, year etc. Important to also look for historical volumes and compare in relation to historical prices. 

When doing this, it's also important to check the market's history and look for some important related metrics. Like: What's the All Time High? Has the coin been above current prices many times (and if yes, how much trading volume did it take to break above the price level)? What's the relation of the previous ATH with the current price? 

**How to look into this?** Simply go into the page of a coin on Coinmarketcap or Coingecko and look at historical prices. 

## 6. **Market capitalization value**

This is an important indicator. It's showing the total value of all the coins in circulation, usually measured in FIAT (USD). But there are also some related metrics that might make the market cap value unreliable. For instance: If the market cap went up by a lot due to a nearly vertical price rise recently then it's not very representative of a market's substance. You should try to consider the market cap before an ongoing *pump* for something more representative. Also, if a coin's market cap value is high with tiny volumes compared to coins of a similar market cap value, then this can be a red flag. 

The *coin* market cap is also a limitation to how much a coin's price could rise. A golden rule of thumb over this issue is that no coin should ever be expected to surpass bitcoin in market cap value. So in simple terms, the result of the formula 

    coins * price 

will never be more than bitcoin's market cap value (in $). Consider this a hard limit to how much a coin can rise in value. And by this point I think that you should also consider any price prediction according to which a coin would come near ETH's market cap value as unsubstantiated, grossly speculative and wildly inaccurate. In most occasions, this can be used to debunk claims that a coin can go *10x*, which is a very common attempt driving FOMO panic buying for a coin. 

**How to look into this?** Just go to coinmarketcap.com's main page and/or the specific coin's page and see how that coin ranks.

Thanks for reading. If you think there's something I should add or have any questions feel free to comment. I know this post is mostly focusing on past data. But if this gets enough upŒΩotes I might make a complementary post to write about live indicators in simple words as I did in this post.

plokij24,0.0,1857.0,"With so many new people in the crypto space, there are many mistakes that have been made that new investors need to know about.

One of them is what to do with your hardware wallet when you first receive it.

#Legitimate devices

In 99%+ of cases (99% is a low estimate) you will receive a legitimate hardware wallet. However, there have been cases of fake Ledger/Trezor wallets, or even wallets already set up (more on this below).

[How to ensure your Ledger is genuine](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002481534-Check-if-device-is-genuine).

[How to ensure your Trezor is genuine](https://blog.trezor.io/psa-non-genuine-trezor-devices-979b64e359a7).

These steps are particularly important if you buy from places like Amazon where there is very little individual stock quality control.

#Your seed

When setting up your hardware wallet for the first time, you will be generating a **BRAND NEW SEED**. If you did not do this step during the setup, it's possible that someone has set it up, hoping you don't notice.

They then monitor your wallet for transactions and drain your wallet.

Every wallet has a process of generating your seed, then displaying it for you to record. This applies to every type of wallet, so if this isn't something you did you should investigate ASAP as your funds may be at risk.

#Factory reset

After you have properly set up your new wallet and have noted down your seed, it's time to wipe your device. **Yes, this is necessary.**

Before sending a single transaction to your new address, factory reset your device and recover it using your seed. This ensures you have noted down your seed correctly and you are **capable** of restoring your wallet if it gets damaged or stolen.

I personally know people who had no trouble setting up their wallet, but needed a lot of help recovering it. Practicing this with a zero-balance wallet is an extremely valuable exercise.

This is such an important step that too many people don't do. Always practice disaster recovery as hardware devices will always eventually fail. It may be 15 years from now, but hardware doesn't last the test of time.

Also worth noting - your seed can be used to recover your wallet across another medium. For example, the seed from your Trezor can be put into a desktop wallet like Exodus and you will be able to access everything.",CryptoCurrency,Things you NEED to do when you first receive your hardware wallet,1857.0,0.99
jnc23,0.0,1852.0,"There has been a recent flurry of posts trying to reassure newbies that thisisfine.jpeg. Whenever there is a dip, some old hands decide to help out/motivate/karma-farm/act high and mighty...

These feel-good posts are all well and good, but once you've seen one, you've seen them all. So I'm going to *try* and add a bit more substance (though I am aware of the irony that I'm basically doing the same thing, only with better grammar and more references to peer-reviewed journals).

Informative posts tend to get downvoted to hell though, so who knows if this will even be seen. I spent a bit of time trying to put it together, so if you think it's useful, please do give an upvote for visibility.

##Tl;dr If you play it safe - with boring strategies, such as dollar-cost averaging, diversifying in high-cap tokens, and taking advantage of compound interest - you will probably still get massive return on investment.


Also, as I get older, I'm starting to realise a few years isn't *that* long. Traditional financial investment might make you rich over 30-40 years. I believe crypto can do it in 5-10. This might seem like a lot, but it's not. Stop thinking in days and weeks and start thinking in months and years.
.

**First, some data on trading:**

[The average individual investor underperforms a market index by 1.5% per year. Active traders underperform by 6.5% annually](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=219228)

[Profitable day traders make up a small proportion of all traders ‚Äì 1.6% in the average year.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/529c/ce873471d616cb0778e224fa8060785f13d6.pdf?_ga=2.168609569.1460452885.1606468814-1953133549.1606468814)

[The typical day trader loses
money by a considerable margin after adjusting for transaction costs](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.533.2044%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijwLr5s6LtAhUTWsAKHe1xBgEQFjALegQICBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pVZbTXvySyiRdLNkb6WQS)

Furthermore, the authors of the second study write that ""inconsistent with models of rational speculation and learning, we document that the aggregate performance of day traders is negative"".

This is all about regular stock trading, but you get the idea.
.


**Second, some anecdata about crypto friends:**

Maybe academic papers aren't your thing. Fair enough.

Back in 2017, two friends of mine got into crypto and we started a WhatsApp group to share tips. One friend invested steadily into Bitcoin and a few alts. The other friend invested heavily into altcoins and traded every day. In a bull market everybody thinks they're a genius. He made a lot of money then lost it all. In 2018, he tried to carry on trading, but this was now a bear market. He lost even more.

Fast forward to this year, and he's now anti-crypto. Regrets all the money he lost. Thinks it's all a scam. At the first sign of recovery, he converted the dregs of his altcoins to BTC, sold via Coinbase and left the chat. If he'd held on for another month or two he might have recouped some losses, but he didn't.

My other friend carried on DCA'ing into BTC and ETH and is now up considerably.
.


**Third, some cognitive biases**


[Survivorship bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) means that we concentrate on the people who win. See some smug bastard proclaiming his shitcoin profits in the Daily? He won. What you don't see are the hundreds of Wojaks who tried different trades and lost. Badly. You are more likely to be one of those sad fucks. Sorry.

[Hyperbolic discounting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting) is the preference for immediate payoffs to greater payoffs at a later date. Crypto is seen as a ""get rich quick"" scheme. If you're new to this game, reset your expectation to ""get rich more slowly than I'd like, but still fairly quick all things considered"" scheme and you'll do just fine.
.


**Next, some info on Dollar Cost Averaging:**

[Buying $100 of Bitcoin every month for 3 years starting 3 years ago would have turned $3,600 into $5,413 (+50%)](https://dcabtc.com?sd=2017-11-27&amp;sda=3_years&amp;f=monthly&amp;d=3_years&amp;ac=10000&amp;c=false) 

That might not sound like much but the point is that *even if* you had bought bitcoin near the absolute peak, you would still be 50% up by now. That is INSANELY good.

Let's play around a bit more.

[ Dollar cost averaging Bitcoin biweekly from 07/09/2016 to 11/27/2020 gave 526.26% ROI](https://www.bitcoindollarcostaverage.com) and you would now own 4.3 BTC. 2016 was early, but it shows how a little time in the market works.
.


**Can you beat the market by buying the market?**

[Check out the top ten crypto fund posts.](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) 
The answer is... *probably*.

There is a lot of data to comb through here and I bloody love this guy's monthly updates. They're honestly the best posts on this whole subreddit.

I hope he doesn't mind me attempting to summarize, but the main points appear to be:

* BTC and ETH have generally outperformed the other picks
* Crypto is still beating the stock market
* (This depends on buy-in times)
* Despite it being a three-year bear market
* The upside in a bull market is huge.
.


**Longterm predictions**

Mathematical analysis of crypto gets a bad rap. John McAfee famously got it wrong. But that doesn't mean it's all nonsense. Patterns tend to repeat.

[Here are various predictions for a $100,000 Bitcoin.](https://www.moonmath.win/)

The logarithmic regression band shows a steady upward trend, with decreasing volatility. It's a reasonable assumption that this will continue. There will be bubbles, there will be corrections, but BTC will continue going up. And if you iron out the swings, it will give greater returns than any other asset class. Crypto as a whole will also go up and other coins will give even greater return. These will be hard to predict. Diversifying a small amount into a few other coins will give some exposure to this effect without too much risk.
.


**Finally, some thoughts on compounding**

OK, not your keys, not your crypto. 

But... Someone once said compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world and the key to wealth.

The reason for the boom this summer is DeFi. For the first time, it's possible to earn interest on crypto. There are risks involved, but it is a force multiplier that can massively improve your success, and it would be remiss of you to not consider it.

Compound interest is great on its own. But using compound interest to accumulate more units of an asset that is itself appreciating, will accelerate the process dramatically.

Consider the following:

* You bought one Bitcoin at $10,000.
* You HODL for ten years and it reaches $100,000.
* Go you.

Or:

* You put that Bitcoin into DeFi/CeFi
* You get 6.5% compounding interest.
* You HODL for ten years and BTC reaches $100,000
* But you now have 1.91 BTC
* You have $191,000
* That's 19x your initial buy-in. Nearly twice as good as just HODLING.

I urge you to play around with [a compound interest calculator](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php).

If nothing else, it should show you the value of thinking in longer timeframes.

Currently, the best bank accounts are offering under 1% interest. Which means you're actually losing money after inflation. On the other hand, staking is coming to Eth and DeFi isn't going anywhere. There are risks with DeFi, and using crypto custodians is philosophically at odds with the dream of pseudonymous digital cash. 

That's for you to think about. But use the calculator above, plug in some numbers, and see where 12% interest gets you in 20 years. Even if you just used fiat, that would get you pretty far. Now think about getting even 5% return on Eth or BTC. Now think about what 1 BTC or 1 ETH will be worth then. Factor in dollar cost averaging on top of that. And you're risking it all chasing pumps every day? 

Slow down, and consider the safe, boring, options. You might be surprised where you get to in a few years.

*Edit - A few people have pointed out, rightly, that I underplayed the risk of DeFi. I agree that lending your money to a custodian or a random smart contract is a risky play. But the potential of compound interest over time is an exciting development in this space, and possibly safer than day-trading. But only if you're comfortable.

I buy and sell all the time and I spend hours digging looking for new coins to buy. Last year I used uniswap to buy a token that was only available there. it was only one transaction and I didn‚Äôt really care much and totally forgot about the app. Fast forward to today , I decided to get back into crypto. I did some homework and found a couple good gems to buy on uniswap so I decide to open the app. 

I initiated  the transaction and I looked down to a button that says uniswap. I didn‚Äôt know what it was so I ignored it and my transaction failed. So I tried again and I was like meh I‚Äôll just click it and see what it‚Äôs in it. 

As soon as I open it and I get the message ‚Äúclaim your 400 UNISWAP‚Äù and I was completely shocked. 

I owned the 400 from the airdrop since last year and I didn‚Äôt even know it!!!! And I rode it from 2 dollars all the way to 19.55 today! Imagine if I found out about it sooner I would‚Äôve probably sold around 3 or 4 dollars (I know myself) but instead I rode it like a champ at a 524% increase ! Holy fucking shit. This just happened a few minutes ago and I thought this is the place to share such story

Edit: earlier today my wife and I were stressing about our 1 bed room apartment since we have a baby coming on the way. We were planning to buy a house in August but this money will pull our date to may which will be perfect and right before our baby gets here! 
I am very grateful and I CANT WAIT to tell my wife in the morning.

*Edit: We'll be hopping on to answer all your questions at 3pm ET, but in the meantime please upvote the thread and post your questions!*

FinCEN, an arm of the US Treasury, has proposed a new rule allowing them to track your cryptocurrency transactions without the need for a warrant. They want to force all cryptocurrency exchanges to keep records on transactions to private wallets over $3k, and automatically report all transactions to private wallets over $10k directly to FinCEN. These reports will include things like your name, transaction amount, and even the public address you are sending the cryptocurrency too. With this information, FinCEN has the ability to not only surveil all your future transactions, but also view past transactions. No private or government entity has the right to access such sensitive information, and this move should be met with fierce resistance.

Luckily, we have 1 more day to make our voices heard, as comments for this rule end on Jan 7th. If you oppose this move by FinCEN, head over to [StopFinancialSurveillance.org](https://www.StopFinancialSurveillance.org), and tell them to reverse course on this terrible new rule.

We're here to answer your questions, so ask us anything!

This is why we always say to invest only what you can afford to lose. It's boring, but it's true. 

What I've noticed is that many people here:

* Don't do their own research, don't care about tech,
* buy cryptos based on Youtuber's shilling videos,
* or based on shilling comments on Reddit, Discord, etc.,
* or even worse, pick coins based on names and logos,
* and expect to become millionares overnight. 

These people are here to gamble with, and not to invest in cryptocurrencies that one day might disrupt the global financial system.

They must've thought they are really smart and lucky with their gains these past few weeks. But in reality, if I asked my dog to pick 5 random coins from the 4th page of CoinMarketCap, I would've made the same gains probably.

Magelis86,0.0,1737.0,"I was surprised by the amount of people asking: ‚Äòhow do I store my bitcoin on my USB?‚Äô or ‚ÄòHow do I get my crypto off the network?‚Äô. Basically, you can not do that. Here is how it works :

Crypto never leaves the network on which they are. You can not physically store Bitcoin or any crypto on a USB, You can not store Bitcoin (or any crypto) on any device. Every crypto stays on its network.

Ok. So how does it work? 

If you buy a crypto, the first thing that you want to do is to put it in your wallet. To create a wallet, you need first to create your private key (the one that you should never give away). And this private key will generate an address on the network. Then, you can put your funds on this address, (thus, in your wallet). Hence, despite being in your wallet, at the end, the funds are (and will always stay) on the crypto-network, on your address. So, basically, a wallet is just a software, a window allowing you to communicate and interact with your address (and, with your funds on the network).

With every crypto, everyone can see your funds. You just need a simple address. Go check by yourself on BTC explorer for instance: you can check everyone's funds! But, except checking someone's funds, there is not that much that you can do. Why? Because to control the funds, you need the key.

Remember the wallet, this piece of software which allows you to interact with your address? To access it, you need the private key. The private key unlocks the address and allows you to send the funds.

Think about it like your house: everyone can know your home address, where you live, They can see your house (from outside). Does it mean that I can enter in and get access to what‚Äôs inside? No! For that, they need the key. And it's the same for every surrounding house.

A crypto network is like a town with many houses, each of those houses containing more or less furniture. And, you can only move furniture from one house to another. You can not leave the furniture in the street and you can not store those furniture on a USB. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense! The furnitures have to be inside a given house. 

And, the only way to move furniture from one house to another is to have the key to a particular house, unlock it, and use special guys called miners to send your stuff from house A to house B.

You then understand that in order to control the funds, you need the private key. And this is what people store on their USB, paper wallet or Ledger device : THEIR PRIVATE KEY. And, If right now, I could get access to your private key (no matter where I'm in the world), I could hypothetically use this key (your key!) to log on the wallet and get access to all your funds. Exactly like if you give me your password from your bank account or the key to your house.

Ok great... But what about hard wallets?

Each crypto requires to install a wallet (and thus to further create Private key). So, if you start to diversify (like most of us) and end up with 25 different cryptos, it will quickly become a burden to safely store all of those different keys...Also, leaving your private key unprotected on your computer or typing it on a computer connected to internet is dangerous. Hackers might be able to see what you are doing and thus, steal your key. This is where hard wallet such as Ledger Nano or Trezor come into play.

A Hard wallet safely store all your keys and will never let them touch the internet. It requires you (more accurately, your little fingers) to push physical buttons on the Ledger. No hacker can hack your hands. It also automatically manages all your private keys. Indeed, it randomly\* generates a MASTER KEY. \*\*\*TAKE A DARK VOICE \*\*\* : A MASTER KEY TO RULL THEM ALL... which will be used to create all the private keys for your coins. This is a 24 words sequence that you need to store safely. This is the key to all your private keys. If your Ledger get destroyed, buy a new one and enter those 24 words. It will regenerate all your crypto private keys that offer you control on your assets.

\* Random*? Yes, because it is important to know that computers can not generate random stuff (a computer doesn‚Äôt have a will and it‚Äôs everything but random). So basically, they can‚Äôt pick random numbers. Then, how the Ledger does generate a random key? Simply put : when you first switch it on, it will capture the electric noise inside itself and it will put a huuuuge number on this value. This number will be used to create the master key (those 24 words). Because the electric noise is extremely variable and will never be the same ever, your master key will be unique and ‚Äòrandomly generated‚Äô. So, basically, your 24 words are the representation of the electric noise signature that was captured when the ledger was first switched on. No one will never be able to guess it or generate the same.

And I will repeat this point : to control the ledger (so the master key and the associated funds), you need to push physical buttons on it. No hacker can hack that because you need a physical finger to push it. You can not hack the finger of someone to push a button! So, it‚Äôs ultra safe.

So, what are the worst things that can happen? First : your ledger get destroyed and you didn‚Äôt properly back up your 24 words. Then your funds are lost. Second : The Ledger company gets hacked (what happened few months ago). Hackers will never get access to your master key (cause as I said, it was ‚Äòrandomly generated‚Äô when the hard wallet was first switched on and the Ledger company doesn't know it). But they will have access to some of your personal infos : name, address, email etc. So at best, you will receive phishing email. Never give your key to anyone. Ledger will never ask for your key. At worst, people might break into your house to steal your 24 words. So store your key safely!

I hope this helps to clarify things for newcomers.

TL;DR : If you are new, you should take 5min to read that. If you are an advanced crypto user : go on your way :)

CrabCommander,0.0,1559.0,"I was sort of shocked I couldn't find this data basically anywhere (or where it was available, it was usually only for a list of like 10 coins).  So, without further ado, here is a breakdown of the current top 101 coins by market cap, grouped into buckets based on their usage/purpose.

**Note:** Inevitably some coins try to 'do everything'.  I limited each to only being listed once, so things are grouped by whatever their perceived or advertised *primary* purpose is, even if they theoretically can do more than that.  (For example, probably 75% of the entire top 100 list has 'dApps' listed somewhere in their description, but it is not the main point they advertise on, at least currently, for many of them)


# Store of Value
There's only one true asset in this category, and it's not one that intended to be here.  Bitcoin was originally designed as digital currency, but insanely high transaction fees, changes in expectation over time, etc. have really morphed it into an asset more akin to gold or other asset stores.  (AKA: It's an investment, not really for spending directly, and has limited other direct use.)

    1 - Bitcoin

# Digital Currency
What Bitcoin originally wanted to be, this is a category filled with Bitcoin spin offs and new tech focused primarily on cheaper, faster transactions.  The use cases range from every-day purchases to more massive actions such as major cross-border intra-bank transfers.  ( It's worth noting about half of this list also offers smart contracts as well ( or plan to soon ), but thus far have been primarily notable for general transaction speed/currency use. )

    5  - XRP
    8  - Litecoin
    10 - Bitcoin Cash
    12 - Stellar
    17 - Bitcoin SV
    21 - Terra/Luna
    24 - NEM
    46 - Dash
    48 - Decred
    56 - Ziliqa
    65 - DigiByte
    74 - Nano
    84 - Horizen


#Smart Contracts/Distributed Applications
This is going to be a long list.  Smart contracts/dApps are pretty clearly the most exciting 'generic' use for Blockchain/Crypto Currencies by many people's viewpoint, opening the doors for a lot of unique applications and financial structures.  Essentially everyone in this category is gunning for Ethereum's spot, and the competition is hot and heavy all the way down the top 100 list, with every entry trying to put their own spin on it.

    2  - Ethereum
    4  - Cardano
    6  - Polkadot
    18 - Eos
    19 - Elrond
    20 - Tron

#Stablecoins
These are tokens that attempt to stay pegged to some real world kind of value (generally USD) via various methods.  Pretty straight forward, and mostly varies by what network/exchange you're on.

    3  - Tether
    13 - USD Coin
    36 - Dai
    40 - Binance USD
    84 - HUSD
    89 - Ampleforth ( Peg to USD is fairly weak )
    91 - TrueUSD
    
#Exchange Tokens
These are tokens that primarily are associated with some kind of crypto-currency exchange, either Centralized(CEX) or Decentralized(DEX).  A few of them also try to serve other purposes (Usually as Digital Currencies), but at heart being used as an exchange token is their most notable point, and they will largely rise and fall based on the success of their related exchange.

    7  - Binance Coin
    15 - Uniswap
    33 - Huobi Token
    38 - Sushiswap
    39 - FTX Token
    41 - Crypto.com Coin
    44 - UNUS SED LEO
    61 - Loopring
    64 - SwissBorg
    67 - THORChain
    68 - Curve DAO Token
    73 - PancakeSwap
    76 - Voyager Token
    81 - OKB
    92 - Alpha Finanace Lab
    100 - Bancor

#Alternative Exchange Tokens
These are tokens that are related to the crypto trading markets, but aren't really proper exchange tokens.  Basically for exchange-esque activities, or offering only a specific, narrow type of alternative trading.

    25 - Synthetix ( Options Trading )
    52 - 0x ( DEX Aggregator )
    42 - UMA ( Options Trading )
    72 - 1inch ( DEX Aggregator )
    78 - HedgeTrade ( Crypto Hedge Fund Trading )
    87 - Kyber Network ( DEX Aggregator )


#Extra-Blockchain Communication/Transfers
These tokens/networks exist primarily to solve the problem of communicating between different blockchain networks/the non-blockchain world, and the transfer of assets across said barriers.  (Ex. The Oracle Problem)

    9  - Chainlink
    22 - Cosmos
    60 - Ren
    75 - ICON
    77 - Quant
    99 - Ravencoin

#Lending/Banking/Yield Farming
These tokens and networks focus around making trustless lending and banking (savings accounts) possible, and yield-farming via said lending.  Generally speaking, they work via encouraging users to stake/lock up digital collateral from other networks into their own, giving the users the network's own tokens as the loan balance and/or paying the user tokens for other users borrowing their assets.

    14 - Aave
    28 - Maker
    31 - Compound
    45 - Celsius
    47 - yearn.finance
    58 - Nexo
    97 - Venus

#Privacy Coins
Fairly self explanatory, these primarily exist to keep as much data about the network/transactions/wallets as anonymous as possible.  They've obviously gotten a bad rep at times as being used often for illicit activities, but there's nothing inherently wrong with wanting privacy either.

    23 - Monero
    50 - Zcash
    101 - Verge
    
    
#Other
These coins/tokens have largely unique use cases, that leave them without many/any direct competitors in the top 100.  Whether they go up or down is going to be mostly based on if their use cases actually exist and if they can succeed in filling them correctly.  A few of these are gunning towards long term moving into the more general categories, but at least currently book themselves as having a more narrow focus.

    11 - Dogecoin ( Meme/Intro to Crypto )
    26 - THETA ( Distributed Video Streaming )
    30 - VeChain ( Supply Chain Logistics )
    35 - IOTA ( Internet of Things Logistics )
    37 - Filecoin ( Distributed File Hosting )
    49 - The Graph ( Distributed Search Indexing )

    94 - Ocean Protocol ( Data Monetization )
    98 - Enjin Coin ( Video Game Items/In-Game Economy )
    
#N/A - Wrapped Assets
These are 'wrapped' versions of other assets (Bitcoin) floating around other networks for use on said networks.  There's generally limited reason to directly invest in these when you could invest in their more liquid base asset.  (Ex. You'd only buy them to use them in some specific DApp/etc, not just hold them in a wallet generally)

cynical_americano,0.0,1522.0,"NO Doge is not like BTC

There is no limited supply. It was specifically intended to remain cheap to facilitate FAST txns. Raising the price directly conflicts with this ~~and will likely result in an influx of new coins into circulation.~~ *Doge is designed to add a fixed supply of new coins to the ecosystem on a constant basis to deflate the price continually*. **THE SUPPLY IS NOT LIMITED, UNLIKE BTC.**

&amp;#x200B;

NO the situation with Doge is not like GME in ANY WAY.

GME happened because of SHORTS. AFAIK ~~this is not something that exists in the crypto world~~ ""suits"" aren't shorting Doge. You are relying on other (retail, most likely) investors to take your bags when the shit hits the fan.  This is not screwing over wallstreet or investment firms in any perceivable way. They don't give a shit about Doge, and they sure as shit don't have short positions, the entire catalyst to the price increase with GME, forcing them to buy down the road.

&amp;#x200B;

NO you are not helping crypto by supporting a pump and dump.

A LOT of new eyes are on crypto lately. If their first experience is holding bags after being sold a lie on a pump and dump (could be called a pyramid) scheme, they will most likely come away with a horrible impression of crypto as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

NO I'm not a hater

Now is the time to prove a point, a point bigger than money. This is why GME was so pivotal, it is taking money from the rich fuckers who have gamed the system for so long with no downsides. That is not the same situation with Doge, a coin no reasonable corporate investor would ever take interest in. Despite how much the doge folk like to talk about Elon's mention of the coin, he made a few off hand remarks, and a week later changes his twitter bio to say #BITCOIN NOT #DOGE. Why would he do that if he was so sold on the idea? I don't even care if you pump and dump, but the MASSIVE amount of hype you're building, preying on ignorant retail investors, is concerning.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm prepared for a massive backlash, but I'm fairly certain anyone who has done their research knows Doge is nothing but a shitcoin to be used for pump and dump (it fails at its intended purpose), kind of like MEME. It's quite literally a meme coin.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to hype a coin, maybe try one with an actual use-case and limited supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: correction about new coin generation and shorting. the supply of new coins is fixed and is not directly related to the price, however the intention of DOGE is to be remain a (relatively) cheap currency,  which is why the supply is inflationary. I am not an expert and still have a lot to learn myself, but what I watched happen with DOGE was the same thing I watched happen to many shitcoins (including DOGE) in 2017, and empathize with my past self I wanted to spread the word for new eyes. MEME went 15x the same night DOGE went 4x BTW, for anyone that missed it.

I encourage everyone to do their own research. Read white pages, look at professional analysis. I am trying to respond to comments as I can, but this blew up more than I ever expected.

I can answer three out of four:

**How did we get here?**

We pretty much had a perfect storm of conditions all aligning at once:

\-Grayscale announced the reopening of it's ETH trust. This is one of the biggest factors, as it causes a massive influx of institutional investors.

\-VISA announced additional partnerships and adoption of cryptocurrencies.

\-Introduction of ETH futures trading.

\-Volatility in traditional markets due to the short squeeze of GME, among other market factors.

\-Introduction of new investors to the crypto space due to the dogecoin pump and dump.

All of these things together caused a skyrocket in demand from day traders, retail investors, your boomer parents, and institutional investors all at once.

**Could we have predicted this?**

Absolutely. Take a took at this 1 month chart and see if you can identify any patterns:

[oh yeah you like that don't you](https://preview.redd.it/h5qid9480bf61.png?width=2635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36df1c69790b25b46e158b0554be267b47f06bfe)

That's right baby, we're in the classic ""Vitalik's Dong"" formation.

From the moment the rally breaks $1k at the taint, you can see a clear pattern form. The price hits alternating higher highs and higher lows, forming the ceiling and base of the shaft, respectively. It starts to condense as we reach the tip and then splooges out into our current rally. Our current price point leaves us at an interesting spot: we're just lightly stroking the top of the shaft. If we can break through, we can expect to see a higher climax to our current rally. If we just edge that top, we may continue back down to the base and see a retraction to $1350. I think our most likely scenario, however, is that we continue somewhere in the middle: along the ""golden stream.""

Now that we are having a little correction, rather than checking the folio everyday and worrying, it's a good time to research other projects, see what developers are doing and how their communities are growing.

So I thought I'd give a brief guide into how I research crypto projects, and if anyone else has any more suggestions, please comment below to help the community.

1 ) Understand how market cap, coin supply, and price works. This is one of the most important basics to know when looking into crypto value. The best way to do this is to use the formula price x circulation = market cap. 

2 ) what are the fundamentals. 
- check the website and see it's well written.
- what is the project trying to achieve?
- who are their competitors and are they doing anything different to them?

3 ) see if the founders of the project are anonymous or listed. Lack of transparency is a huge red flag in the crypto space.

4 ) check the community
- are they on Twitter, Reddit, and telegram
- do they have an active community
- do the community talk about the tech or just speculate about price?

5 ) what is the roadmap of the project?
- are they in test net, or are they live on main net
- what are they looking to achieve over the next 12 months

6 ) do they have any partners?
- are they collaborating with any other crypto projects
- do they have any plans for adoption outside the crypto space.

These are just some of the questions I ask when looking for a project to invest in.

Hope it helps, and good luck with your investment!

mastvrbatr,0.0,1429.0,"For myself, life over the past few years has seemingly gone from bad to worse - and before I go into the details -this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpity-post‚Äù or a sympathy searching exercise, this is simply a warning, and hopefully a lesson to others who are entering the crypto scene.

My crypto journey began back in earnest at the start of that famed 2017 ‚Äúbull run‚Äù ‚Äì I had a little bit in savings and had done my due diligence ‚Äì this really was the future, and it could potentially set me and my family up for life.

I bought in with every bit of money I had to spare. All told, it was about ¬£6,500, and the price of Bitcoin sat at just under ¬£9,000.

This was exciting. The price continued to increase and I religiously opened and closed the Coinbase website to see the price soar by the hundreds and into the thousands. Work took a backseat and I became consumed with the markets, red and green candles being the first and last things I saw in the day.

I wanted more. I became envious of those that had bought into cryptos years before. So I looked at alternate avenues to increase my Bitcoin holdings‚Ä¶ this was going to be the making of me! Sadly it turned out to be quite the opposite.

**Scams, Scams everywhere‚Ä¶**

The first venture I looked into was a third party bitcoin mining platform which promised exponential growth. It sounded too good to be true (spoiler: it was). I used a credit card to buy more Bitcoin. First mistake. I maxed the card and sent around ¬£6,000 in Bitcoin to a mining company known as Crypterra. The reviews were good, the discord was active, people were seeing payouts ‚Äì it was all looking legitimate. But of course it wasn‚Äôt. Payouts dried up. The devs went silent and the site disappeared and re-appeared sporadically before going offline indefinitely. It was over and I had lost most of the ¬£6,000 from my credit card.

**Robots are the future?**

The price of Bitcoin was still holding strong and I‚Äôd made small gains with my original investment which was still untouched. Perhaps I could increase by Bitcoin gains elsewhere and pay off the credit card I had maxed out.

Again, I looked into ways to bolster my Bitcoin reservesI looked into trading platforms, cryptocurrency bots in particular. How hard could it be? As long as the price of Bitcoin went up, it should balance out any losses as I learned the ropes. There were a few that caught my eye. And following what I thought was sage ‚Äúyoutuber‚Äù advice ‚Äì I dove into the world of trading with bots ‚Äì linking up a Binance account and setting up my automated systems to work their magic and trade whilst I was asleep/working/sitting on the toilet, you name it.

As you can imagine, these bots weren‚Äôt the holy grail they were promoted to be, and I was losing Bitcoin left, right and centre. I became more and more ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù with the strategies‚Ä¶ doubling my stakes, tripling my stakes to recoup what I had lost. I didn‚Äôt see it as real money (despite paying with hard earned money to fund these accounts) ‚Äì it was magic internet money, just ones and zeroes ‚Äì so the reality of it didn‚Äôt hit home how much I was actually losing. Shock horror, I lost it all.

**Taking it to the bookies‚Ä¶**

I had effectively been gambling my money away, and in my increasingly agitated state I sought out other communities to try and regain my money. Sports-betting communities, gambling communities, Twitter ‚Äútipsters‚Äù and Facebook groups who had all the inside knowledge.

I was down over ¬£12,000 from my savings and the ¬£6,500 from the credit card combined. I decided to open another two credit cards. One to fund my betting account and the other for backup. I quickly went through the first card‚Äôs funds, but I was ‚Äòstill learning‚Äô, this was ‚ÄòOk‚Äô ‚Äì next time I would get it right. The second card (third in total) was quickly exhausted, and I was now close to ¬£20,000 in the hole from when I started, all within just a few months.

**The hole grew ever darker**

As I write this now I am actually afraid and embarrassed to share the total losses I have made over the past few years (it‚Äôs actually much worse than I could have ever imagined). I have no-one to blame but myself; the greed, stupidity and at times, pure arrogance have lead me down this path. A path which at the moment seems irreversible for me.

To see the price of Bitcoin now makes me feel physically sick ‚Äì if only I had been patient. If only I hadn‚Äôt chased my losses, if only I hadn‚Äôt played with money that wasn‚Äôt mine - I wouldn‚Äôt be in this predicament. As the debt mounts ever higher and interest rates on credit cards are crippling me, it will be an incredibly long time before I have any financial stability again. It has made me mentally unwell and I‚Äôm still figuring out the next steps which I know include professional support and removing my head from the pile of sand in which I have buried it.

I sincerely hope that those who read this account of my situation don‚Äôt fall into the same trap. The world is once again hyped for crypto, and with it come the pitfalls and scams and false promises of financial freedom and becoming rich. Don‚Äôt try and cheat the system, don‚Äôt chase your losses and don‚Äôt use money that isn‚Äôt yours in the first place.

**TLDR:**

To put it succinctly, the above is a very short overview of the financial hole I have found myself due to greed, arrogance and stupidity over the past few years. Hopefully a warning to others. Don‚Äôt chase losses, don‚Äôt look for the next get rich scheme and don‚Äôt invest money that isn‚Äôt yours to start with. Basically, don‚Äôt ruin your life like me. If only I had just held.

**EDIT:**

A quick edit to say thank you to everyone who has taken the time to read the above and replied in the comments. I've had some very honest and insightful responses and some incredibly useful suggestions about how I can bring myself back from this dilemma. I'll be seeking professional help both for the gambling and the debt management and hopefully get myself on the right track for the sake of my own sanity and that of my family's.",CryptoCurrency,Not another fairy-tale ending - a word of warning for those entering the crypto scene,1429.0,0.96

LactatingJello,0.0,1382.0,"FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) comes with every crypto coin no matter how perfect, decentralized, scalable, etc...

So here's the major FUD for each of the top 10 cryptos for those who are new to the space or want to know more about why some have their doubts about these projects. Some of this FUD may not be ""true"" depending on how you view it but it nonetheless forms a major opinion on why there is FUD surrounding the project. In my opinion, it's important to be aware of it so you can form your own opinion for your investments and help spur discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin** \- Although the pioneer of blockchain technology, it is considered slow, expensive, and unscalable compared to many emerging coins over the past 10 years (LTC, BCH, XLM, NANO, etc..) It's also much easier for you (depending on the country you live in) to send money to a friend or spend your currency at a store with credit cards or apps like Venmo/PayPal. At this point, many question why use bitcoin when they can just use their own currency reflecting how many don't perceive or care about the importance of decentralization. Another major piece of FUD is which country controls most of the bitcoin as it seems China and USA have a dominant control over mining operations which makes many believe that there is nothing stopping one country from attacking the network. Bitcoin also has some other FUD like how it's not a physical asset like gold, whales manipulating the price, what happens if I lose my keys, etc... but many of those arguments can be applied to other crypto and blockchain technology so I won't focus on them here. Forgot to mention, but also energy costs related to mining. 

2. **Ethereum** \- It's no surprise that the major FUD against Ethereum is scalability. There are many platforms on the rise trying to take the spotlight from Ethereum and become a highly scalable and decentralized platform that provides cheap and fast fees for using its applications. Many believe the rise of ADA, DOT, and BNB are mainly because of Ethereum's scaling issues. There is alot riding on ethereum 2 to solve its scaling issues but still seems to be at least a year out before it transitions. Ethereum also has some FUD surrounding its distribution of coins and concerns of whales holding much of the supply but it seems to not have much of the focus right now.

3. **Binance Coin** \- The main argument against BNB is that its primarily centralized and doesn't have value other than being used to reduce fees when trading on Binance. With one company controlling the tokenomics and its future, it goes against what many believe to be the core tenet of blockchain which is decentralization. 

4. **Tether** \- Although its a stablecoin, Tether has possibly the biggest FUD even when compared to bitcoin because of its lack of auditing and what many believe to be ""fake"" money propping up the price of bitcoin. If tether is ever found out to be artificially pumping Bitcoin with fake reserves, it would make the value of Bitcoin artificial and cause a large crash.

5. **Polkadot** \- The rise of DOT so fast into the top 10 this year has made many question its value. DOT had a large token sale in the past couple of years before it's release on exchanges which helped drive its price but makes some fearful of how much early investors control the supply before retail could buy in. Seen as a competitor to Ethereum, DOT is attempting an ecosystem of applications but has yet to prove itself when compared to the number of developers and transactions on Ethereum. There are also concerns regarding DOT's allocation of funding to developers in that there is a large amount of funding being aggressively driven to developers to create apps. There is also some FUD regarding its creator and a fictional story involving a minor he made in the past but I'll let you google that.

6. **Cardano** \- Another competitor to Ethereum is ADA which some believe to be a ""ghostchain"". With a long roadmap ahead and many items to deliver, Cardano doesn't have near the amount of transactions or applications compared to Ethereum but promises to be the 3rd generation of crypto platforms ahead of Ethereum. There are also concerns over how much the network is decentralized but that doesn't seem to be the main focus of FUD right now. Much like DOT, ADA is a wait and see.

7. **XRP** \- Many consider XRP to be what blockchain shouldn't be about and that is working with banks and other payment providers to facilitate transactions. With its focus on becoming the choice of crypto for banks and an all in one payment solution, many see it as a zero sum game considering bitcoin's value is about P2P transactions and being decentralized and free of the third party involvement. Ripple has also come under fire recently after being sued by the SEC for misallocation of funding relating to not registering as a securities offering. 

8. **Litecoin** \- Seen as a clone of bitcoin with some minor changes to make it faster and cheaper, LTC's value seems to only be derived from bitcoin's value although that makes many question why they should invest in LTC when BTC exists. LTC's value also competes with other coins that are considered faster, cheaper, and more scalable. There is active development but some think it's small compared to other projects and some consider that the creater of the project, Charlie Lee, abandoned the project after selling his coins in 2017.

9. **Chainlink** \- Seen as an important piece of the Ethereum ecosystem to connect applications and data because of oracles, the major FUD against the project seems to be control of its supply by whales. Many may also not understand why Chainlink needs a token and its inherent value, as oracles can be a confusing topic if you're not already a crypto developer. 

10. **Bitcoin Cash** \- This project has caused a lot of controversy as it was hard forked from bitcoin in 2017. It has attempted to solve bitcoin's scaling problem and become faster and cheaper but many believe it was done as a cash grab by the BCH developers to have a similar name to bitcoin and ride the hype of bitcoin. It also caused some other hard forks to occur like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Gold to cause even more confusion.",CryptoCurrency,The FUD for every top 10 coin and why you should be aware of it,1382.0,0.97

Yesterday I was reading my country‚Äôs most popular newspaper and was greeted with the headline ‚ÄúHacker demands cryptocurrency!!‚Äù. Naturally my interest was grabbed and I went on reading the article that stated ‚ÄúThe hacker demands the private and untraceable cryptocurrency Bitcoin‚Äù, which is obviously wrong since Bitcoin is a public ledger and every single transaction is recorded and saved for eternity. 
Mildly annoyed I emailed the author of the article and explained that Bitcoin is in fact not very private, and certainly not untraceable. After a few back and forth with relevant facts the newspaper issued a correction saying Bitcoin is indeed not very private and is traceable. 

This is what we, the cryptocurrency community, must do every time we see people outside the community reference crypto the wrong way. I urge you all to take a few moments out of your very busy life following shitcoins to correct newspapers and other publications when they simply misinform the public.

pippius,0.0,1270.0,"I haven‚Äôt seen a thread aggregating what are perceived to be the biggest strengths and weaknesses of all of the top cryptocurrencies so I thought I‚Äôd have a go at that here as it is not only useful for me personally but probably also a number of other people relatively new to the world of cryptocurrencies.

To start with, I‚Äôve listed 3 pros and 3 cons for each of the top 25 assets. I‚Äôll try to remain objective. However, I am not a financial advisor, and this is based solely on my own reading and what I think seems to be some kind of consensus. If you think there needs to be things added or removed, let me know below and I‚Äôll endeavour to update this list in reasonable time. Also, please feel free to help me add any other coins below.

I hope this can be a civil discussion without the need for tribalism.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a general understanding among ETH investors that the enhancements from ETH 2.0, EIP-1559 and L2 solutions will result in a sustainable monetary policy with near 0% issuance and the potential for Ether to become a deflationary asset. What is even more interesting is that the net return of ETH as a SoV becomes superior to BTC the moment that issuance is lower than the staking yield. In other words, even if BTC had already ceased issuance, it offers no mechanism to provide yield to long term holders with a negligible risk exposure as ETH does. There is an execution risk that Ethereum will not deliver on what is currently planned, but if it does then what I have explained will become a reality.

You cannot separate BTC/ETH's payment rails from their respective monetary policies. As you are probably aware, issuance is just a subsidy, and without it the network will need to operate as a profitable business with a cash-flow that is entirely dependent on network fees. We are observing a situation that is causing a degradation of the utility of the Bitcoin network. What I mean by that is that the incentive for users to transact directly on the network is being diminished because of the tokenization into ETH and by the introduction of custodians (like Paypal) and traditional banking services who will soon be entering this space. If these trends continue, I suspect that the only activity that will end-up happening on-chain will be done by whales sporadically transacting to hodle and the occasional settlement from institutions. Bitcoin seems fast and frictionless, but that is because you are comparing it to something in the physical world. In digital terms Bitcoin emulates the friction of operation that is found with gold: it is difficult and expensive to move it, securing it yourself is not trivial, and it does not make for a great medium of exchange. I don't think this will be a good dynamic to generate enough transaction fees. That is of course my subjective interpretation of it, but regarding this particular situation it is nearly impossible to make objective assertions at this point. It is possible to assert that, in the digital world, the expectation of frictionless money would entail near instant transactions with negligible cost and without the relative risk/paranoia of dealing with nuclear waste and having a hacker watching your every move waiting for you to make a mistake to snatch it away. Digital money would also need to interact with other digital assets, preferably defined and operated within the same ecosystem. Ethereum is steaming ahead on all ends.

Ethereum is fostering a digital economy (this is a very important part of understanding the value of Ethereum, but I will not be exploring it in this post) with DeFi at its center. It is currently generating about three times as much trx fee revenue as Bitcoin. L2 solutions are going live as we speak, and it appears that they will be much more practical and provide better UX when compared to the Lightning Network. This will help to amplify L1 block space value and push revenue even higher. That will be followed by EIP-1559, which will burn transaction fees. Mining is currently excessively profitable and the hash rate cannot keep up. This means the financial incentive can be reduced and by burning trx fees we achieve the equivalent of an issuance reduction, while stabilizing mining revenue. Eventually the transition to PoS will dramatically cut the operational cost of the network. That means that Ethereum as a business will become more profitable and less reliant on the issuance subsidy. Finally, we will see the introduction of sharding which will scale L1 by up to 1,000 times, compounding the effect of L2 solutions and making it feasible for the network to operate as a platform for new use cases. A solution to the hacker/nuclear waste security situation is being explored via social recovery wallets. It is still in the early stages of research and design, but it is important to realize that the Ethereum community recognizes it as a problem and is working on a solution.

There is a lot more that can be said about the BTC vs ETH debate and I am working on a full write up that explores each individual element in more detail. Regardless, it is important to pay attention to this trend: the smartest people in this space are shifting their point of view and realizing Ethereum's potential. Raoul Pal is a seasoned investor, extremely bright and open minded. He started with Bitcoin, but it did not take him long to understand the value proposition of Ethereum. Lyn Alden is a brilliant investor and mental powerhouse who initially did not think investing in Ethereum could be justified, but she is also[ starting to shift her view](https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis) and now understands that it has a justifiable risk/reward ratio to be included in a portfolio (although she is not personally invested in Ethereum). She has plenty of negative things to say about it, however it appears that she recognizes this is not a black and white situation. I have a feeling she will be revising her analysis on Ethereum again in the future with a more optimist view, but maybe that is just wishful thinking.

The crypto space has a few analogies that have been used to describe technical/economic mechanisms that are somewhat tricky to understand: mining, Ethereum's gas, and the analogy between ether and oil. Crypto ""mining"" is not like real world mining. It's purpose is not to extract resources, but it is rather a decentralized mechanism to process transactions. Newly minted BTC tokens are not ""mined"", they are minted by the protocol and awarded to operators. Furthermore, it is impossible to change the total mining output of the network... adding/removing miners does not affect the mining output. If you are new to crypto, you can read a more detailed explanation of mining[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k4qdyc/if_you_are_new_to_crypto_you_may_be_slightly/). ETH's ""gas"" is not like fuel (it cannot even be stored). It is just a computational metric that is more akin to the distance a car must travel, but not what actually makes it move. The fuel is electricity and it must be paid for with ether. When you transact you are also paying for the ""car"" which is the use of all active mining hardware/validators for a fraction of a second. And ether is just money.

If you put too much weight on these simplified analogies, you will not understand the economic actuality behind them. This is a source confusion in the crypto space, and it is used to support false narratives. From an economic perspective, ether is money. Once you understand this, you will know that the narrative that BTC and ETH are not competing because they are different things is analogous to saying fax machines do not compete with the internet.

The beautiful thing about ether is that it is actually not ""just money"". It is a mixture of a scarce monetized commodity, money, bond and tech stock.

* **Monetized Commodity**: Ether is becoming more scarce and will continue to do so with the transition to proof-of-stake and EIP-1559. Ethereum does not have a supply cap, but it does have a roadmap for a sustainable security model and if it achieves a positive cashflow then it will not only eliminate issuance, it can become deflationary.[ An argument can be made about potential issues with Bitcoin's sustainability in the long run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k46gge/the_threat_to_bitcoin_that_no_one_is_talking_about/)
* **Currency**: Ether is used as a unit of account and medium of exchange to pay for every activity in Ethereum. It is also used in the same way for venture capital related to ICOs, and Ether is also used as collateral in the DEFI space and new monetary uses will continue to emerge. It is an immature form of money, just like Bitcoin is an immature form of gold. Some people prefer to say that Ether is just a utility token. However, a utility token is just a narrowly scoped form of money. Not only is Ether's scope within its digital economy growing, by next year users will be able to pay millions of merchants with Ether through Paypal. We have never seen the adoption of a new form of money grow organically. New forms of money have always been imposed by authorities. What would the organic growth of money look like? It would look like Ether.
* **Ethereum's digital economy**: Ethereum has limitless use cases and it is already generating economic activity with real world usefulness. Ether's value will benefit from acting as the native monetary asset for Ethereum. As Ethereum's economic activity grows, the velocity and/or value of ether must also increase.
* **Bond**: With proof-of-stake you need to lock up Ether to receive a yield in return. It is similar to how bonds work.
* **Tech Stock**: Ethereum provides a service. That service is paid with ether. The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked. The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes, the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the Ether token become. Cloud based services is the entire business model of many companies. The network will be entirely operated by stakers who happen to be the recipients of transaction fees. It is not exactly the same as holding a stock, but there are a lot of parallels.
* **Full reserve banking model**: This is a bit of a stretch, but it is a potential end-game for Ethereum. It can serve as the base infrastructure and reserve asset for a full reserve banking system. In a nutshell: a consortium of banking companies can be formed to standardize a framework to hold and stake Ether under custody in exchange for wrapped Ether. Customers deposit Ether, banks exchange it for wETH and stake the original ETH. Resting balances of wEther on customer accounts can receive a cut of the staking rewards. Banks get their profit model, customers get to spend wrapped Ether with traditional banking services and potentially receive a share of the staking yield. Customers could also have access to a yield curve based on variable reserve requirements. This would allow banks to create money (which is actually good for the economy when it is done with moderation), but for the first time ever customers would have the choice of how much risk exposure they are comfortable with. This dynamic could help to establish a form of democratic check and balances system that discourages moral hazard. Ether could become a godsend to banks in the land of negative yields. It's a pipe dream, but not entirely impossible. Don't forget that the US OCC has essentially given banks the green light to take the first steps in this direction (US banks have been approved to use the Ethereum blockchain for their operations AND they can become validators... yup this happened).

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 1: Adding an analogy to explain why ether is money:**

Let‚Äôs say I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That‚Äôs because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the ICE is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether.

Ethereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. In the long run, as the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices goes down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money. In the short run you may see the opposite occurring because of the dynamic between the portion of block space demand that is inelastic and the demand for ether.

**EDIT 2: Revisiting key concepts to explain how they will become price catalysts.**

1. **Wide adoption of L2 solutions**: these will amplify the base layer block space value while encouraging further network adoption by a significant reduction of fees. A successful integration with DeFi protocols will dismiss the ""Ethereum killers"" theory and consolidate market confidence.
2. **EIP-1559**: reduce excessive financial incentives to miners by burning transaction fees. This will also discourage miners from attempting to artificially raise fees via spam.
3. **Sharding**: scale L1 bandwidth, compounding the effect of L2 solutions, further consolidating Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space, making it feasible to introduce new use cases and eventually increase trx fee revenue.
4. **The switch from PoW to PoS**: discontinuing PoW will eliminate the operating costs related to mining and will allow for a reduction of issuance. Money that was previously allocated to buying mining equipment will be redirected to the acquisition of Ether. Staking Ether will remove it from circulation for extended periods of time. Operating cost will be negligible, allowing validators to withhold most of the Ether revenue. This will be the greatest bull market catalyst in the history of cryptocurrencies and it will eclipse the effect of[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=cashtag_click)BTC halvenings.

Bitcoin maximalists will be nay-saying all the way through and past a market cap flip. Do not get caught up in their narrative. If you are not sure, then it is better to rebalance your portfolio proportionally to market caps. If none of these things happen and Ethereum turns out to be a failure, then you would only have reduced your gains by 20%. Otherwise, ETH will be making you mountains of money.

**EDIT 3:** **Ethereum killers**

Ethereum killers remind me a lot of Tesla killers, but a lot worse. People need to understand that cryptocurrency platforms targeting financial Dapps are fighting the equivalent force of a black-hole when it comes to Ethereum‚Äôs network effect and user retention in this space.

Bigger players, with bigger money, are entering this market and they will not settle for anything other than the top dog. This pattern reinforces Ethereum's position as the premium financial system, which ends up attracting even bigger players and resulting in the black-hole effect. To make matters even more complicated, financial apps are more valuable when they are surrounded by a rich and diverse variety of digital assets and other natively defined Dapps. There is not much you can do with your money in a ghost town.

It is VERY difficult to build this type of environment up because the platform and dapps must also have established full trust from their user base. This is not to say there is no space for other networks to grow, but just don‚Äôt get your hopes high that they will be taking Ethereum‚Äôs stronghold as a financial system. There are other use cases that do not require the amount of decentralization and security offered by Ethereum, and the networks that can focus on these are the ones who will be able to coexist with in the long-run. Gaming, ERP interoperability and supply chain are good examples of such use cases. Remember that alternatives with cheap transactions have existed for a while and they have barely touched ETH's dominance (EOS, NEO, VET, QTUM, IOTA, LSK, STRAT, ARK and dare I say... TRON).

**EDIT 4: Refuting critiques about dynamic monetary policy**

If an argument can be made that the financial incentives to operators (miners/stakers) are excessive or insufficient then an argument can be for the implementation and execution of a dynamic monetary policy.

I don't think an arbitrarily picked issuance schedule determined during the genesis of a new highly complex system is likely to be efficient through its lifecycle. Bitcoin's monetary policy provides the certainty of stability and protection from abuse, but it sacrifices the possibility of efficiency and jeopardizes longevity. It would be like if a captain of a ship would point it in the direction of its final destination, set the throttle, then fall back to his cabin for a nice bottle of chianti and hope that the ship would arrive safely. There would be no one at the helm to navigate the seas, no one to make sure it stayed on route, no one to avoid the storms or to take advantage of currents. In my opinion it is a pretty bad approach to something as critical as monetary policy.

With respect to Ethereum's dynamic monetary policy: I don't see any evidence to suggest developers have been enriching their pockets by keeping issuance at the levels they are. Developers are stakeholders and the Ethereum fund holds a lot of ether - debasing ether is against their self interest. There is a great misunderstanding that the one's who are adjusting issuance are the recipients of the new tokens. Is there any documented case of this happening?

**EDIT 5: Addressing Bitcoin's immutable monetary policy**

The idea that Bitcoin's monetary policy cannot be changed is a myth. It is a false narrative that takes for granted that the issuance subsidy will no longer be necessary at some point, but there is no way to objectively assert this. There is no divine power preventing the monetary policy from being changed. If the security model for Bitcoin was jeopardized because of insufficient cash flow to miners, then Bitcoin's monetary policy would be the first thing on the chop board to go in order to remedy the situation.

**EDIT 6:** Five years ago naysayers were screaming about how everything that is being done TODAY in the Ethereum network would never work. Now they are calling Ethereum a scam, or that is is a platform for degenerate gamblers, or that the fees are too high and therefore it is useless, or that it can't scale, or that something else better is just around the corner to take its place.... you know... basically all the things that traditional bankers have to say about Bitcoin, maxis are saying about Ethereum.

**EDIT 7:** The greater the impact a new technology can have on society, the more difficult it is to comprehend its potential. Ethereum has the potential to have a dramatic impact on human civilization. It could take decades for it to be fully realized, but it would change the world in ways that we cannot possibly imagine today. If it happens, the moon will be just a pit-stop.

**EDIT 8:** Thank you so much for all the awards! Ethereans understand this stuff, and I could feel the frustration in the air every time someone said that Ethereum is not money, or that ETH and BTC are completely different things, or all the other bs attacks that are in great part founded on a lack of understanding of how BTC and ETH actually work. I would love to hear what guys like Raoul Pal, Pomp, Michael Saylor and Fernando Ulrich (for my Brazilian friends) would have to say about some of the things that have been written here. If you know a way to get their attention, then please do it.

**EDIT 9**: Clarification about Lyn Alden's opinion of Ethereum

**EDIT 10:** I am still working on a much more ambitious write up. It is focused on economic aspects of money, monetary systems and global asset markets. I still have not incorporated any of the information written here, but I eventually will merge it together. One of the main new ideas that I am exploring is challenging the notion that money has no intrinsic value and that scarcity is the most important attribute of money.

tokoloshe_,0.0,1222.0,"I was discussing this topic with someone new to crypto and thought I'd make it into its own post, hopefully it is useful to anyone starting out in the crypto space and provide some clarity in (relatively) plain english on how ethereum really is changing finance as we know it.

ETH has enabled a few totally new things that really are revolutionary to the crypto space including:

1.	‚Äòstablecoins‚Äô, or more generally 'tokenized assets', cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the value of another asset, like the US dollar. (eg USDT/Tether, USDC, Dai) This allows crypto users to easily exchange their more volatile assets such as ethereum or any other ‚ÄòERC-20‚Äô token (basically a token created using ethereum and exists on the ethereum blockchain), into one that reliably maintains its value, while still having all the advantages of having a blockchain asset (eg secure, global, permissionless transactions).
2.	Decentralized, smart contract-based trading platforms, allowing users to trade while still maintaining full self-custody of their private keys unlike on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. In other words you always maintain control of your coins, instead of needing to send your coins to the exchange to trade them. On top of that they never have any downtime during volatile markets like centralized exchanges. They also can't stop you from trading \*cough cough\* ^(robinhood)
3.	The development of decentralized, peer-to-peer lending/borrowing platforms. This allows users to earn interest on their cryptos or borrow cryptos. These loans are quite low risk due to them being overcollateralized loans, meaning that to take out a loan, you must post collateral, in the form of other crytpocurrencies that is more valuable than what you are borrowing. This means that people can invest in crypto in a low risk way, lending out stablecoins can yield &gt;5% annual returns which, while much lower than what is possible with higher risk crypto investments, is still quite high given the risk profile, easily 10x the annual return of a savings account at a bank.

These three things constitute a large part of what we call ‚Äòdecentralized finance‚Äô or DeFi and right now they only really exist on the ethereum blockchain. Right now there is one major problem for both bitcoin and ethereum, scalability. Essentially, transaction fees are obsurdly high making it cost-prohibitive for most people to take advantage of these amazing new features. The good thing is, over the course of the next 1-2 years (potentially even in the coming weeks), we will be seeing the implementation of several major solutions to this for ethereum. Namely 'Layer 2' (L2) solutions (aka off-chain solutions),  these allow users to make ethereum based transactions off the ethereum blockchain and onto a platform that can handle more transactions. The other solution to the scaling problem is ethereum 2.0. This is an improvement to the ethereum platform itself, making on-chain (as opposed to off-chain, L2) transactions much more effecient. With these solutions in place, we could be seeing transaction fees at &lt;$0.01 and transaction speeds in &lt;1 second. Unfortunately, at least in my view, we don't have the level of concrete development in this area of bitcoin, making the prospect of bitcoin scaling less likely to be coming soon.

So as you can see, the future for ethereum is very exciting, and the things I mentioned really just scratch the surface in what is possible with ethereum.

That means more predictable and lower fees for users, and it will introduce a BURNING mechanism that will burn part of the transaction fees on the network in ETH.

That could very well mean ETH could see serious deflationary pressure (comparable to bitcoin's if not moreso) as early as July.

The increasing growth of DEFI, DAPPS, and transactions on the network coupled with the scarcity introduced through burning could make ETH a comparable or better store of value than Bitcoin.

**To put it in perspective, if EIP-1559 was live yesterday, it would have burned approximately $26M worth of ETH  or roughly 17,000 ETH. Annually that equates to over 6.2 million ETH burned a year at the current rate. That is significantly more than the new ETH being created and would therefore make ETH deflationary**

#**What is Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin was co-founded by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer, who set out to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin.

***Full story and a lot of interesting stuff can be found on the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin)*.**

In the beginning, there were only 100 Billion Doge, and all of them were mined in just two years. After that, the code was updated and another 5 Billion Doge were to be created every year making Doge a currency with infinite supply somewhere in 2015. As documented by [mainstream media](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/dogecoin-to-allow-annual-inflation-of-5-billion-coins-each-year-forever/), some community members disliked this decision and complained that their investment will go to zero while others supported the unlimited supply because true Doge believers don't care about USD value. With all those new digital assets emerging from nowhere the internet needed a currency and Doge filled that gap.

#**Why is Dogecoin?**

If Bitcoin ever goes mainstream you probably won't be able to purchase a whole Bitcoin ever again. Sats would become the standard and value should (in theory) constantly keep going up because network usage will need to keep going up as well. Now imagine that you actually held through hell and back, waited for Bitcoin to hit millions just to lose your private keys however that may happen. No one would be able to recover that capital and you would find it hard to get a new reason to move on. With infinite inflation, things look a bit different.

Scarcity rewards those that get in early and hold on to that currency until demand increases significantly. Doge, on the other hand, incentivizes spending and transacting making it an actual currency. 5 Billion coins per year do sound like a lot but it makes perfect sense in the long run. For example, if you have 100 coins and add 100 more the next year your inflation rate would be 100% but as time passes that percentage will decrease due to the increase in supply. In 100 years your inflation rate is only 1% and still decreasing. To put it simply, Bitcoin is an asset that is expected to have an increase in demand within the next few years or decades while Dogecoin is a currency that aims to provide fast, easy, and cheap value transfers in everyday transactions. If Bitcoin is used to store value, Dogecoin is a tool to quickly and cheaply transfer that value.

#**How is Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin was created as a fork of Litecoin and is also [secured by miners](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/dogecoin/hashrate-chart). It has a much faster block time than LTC of just 1 minute, which made Dogecoin one of the fastest and cheapest currencies to transact with back in the ""old days"". It recently spiked in popularity thanks to Elon Musk and TikTok but if you actually follow the [Dogecoin subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) you will notice that they don't care much about your price speculation. As long as 1 Doge = 1 Doge no one is complaining. In terms of development, there hasn't been a single major update since 2015 but we did make it to [NASCAR](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/27/nascar-dogecoin-sponsor-josh-wise-talladega-superspeedway). As far as network usage goes, Dogecoin [averages](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/) about 1.3k per hour compared to 14k on the Bitcoin network.

**TL;DR: Moons are a new way for people to be rewarded for their contributions to** r/CryptoCurrency. **Claim your Moons in the new** [**Vault**](http://www.reddit.com/vault) **section of the Reddit iOS or Android app! They represent ownership in the subreddit, they are tokens on the Ethereum blockchain controlled entirely by you, and they can be freely transferred, tipped, and spent in** r/CryptoCurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7dabft1uply41.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6eae6a0bb2a0caa71f76b8badf78bb0abfebbf9e

Today we‚Äôre launching a new feature in limited communities called [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/). Community Points are a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions with a unit of ownership in their subreddit. Community Points can be earned, tipped, won, collected, and spent on unique items within a community. Each subreddit has its own stylization of Community Points, and the ones in r/CryptoCurrency are called Moons.

[A Moon](https://preview.redd.it/5bjxciruply41.png?width=60&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b9ae32722eb51d06495355c537b7372c430d3f2)

# How do you get Moons?

Moons are distributed monthly based on individual contributions (comments, posts, etc.) that people make in r/CryptoCurrency. Reddit karma provides a basis for measuring people‚Äôs contribution, but the final decision is up to the community.

Initially, 50 million Moons will be distributed based on karma earned in the subreddit to date. The amount distributed each following month will start at 5 million and decrease by 2.5% every cycle, so that the total number of Moons distributed over time will approach a maximum cap of 250 million.

&amp;#x200B;

[Distribution Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/545uptt0qly41.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7a886c71047d161615e0f1cfe8fef2fd822f38)

# What can you do with Moons?

Moons can be traded freely and used for any number of purposes within the community. At this time, they can be used to display reputation within the subreddit, unlock exclusive features like badges and GIFs in comments with a Special Membership, and add weight to votes in polls.

&amp;#x200B;

[New Special Membership](https://i.redd.it/k2qwvmqzvly41.gif)

# On the Blockchain

Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you‚Äôve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They‚Äôre all yours.

Community Points are currently on the **Rinkeby testnet** (through summer 2020). We plan to migrate Community Points to the Ethereum mainnet, and Points balances will be carried over.

**Note:** If you send Moons to outside non-Reddit wallets or contracts, you are sending them to *testnet* addresses. These tokens will not show up in outside software (e.g. wallet apps, Etherscan) unless you switch to Rinkeby and use the testnet Moons contract address (0xDF82c9014F127243CE1305DFE54151647d74B27A).

# How to get started with your Reddit Vault

The first Moons will soon be distributed to every active contributor in the subreddit with at least 100 karma. You can get started by claiming your Moons in the new [Vault](https://www.reddit.com/vault/) section of the Reddit mobile app, which includes more details on the start-up process and how Moons work.

**Please note that you will need to set up your Vault the first time you access it, and you will need to be on the latest version of the Reddit app (2020.17.0 or later).** We will be rolling the Vault out over the course of the day, so if you don‚Äôt see it now, please check back later.

***See the full blog post with all the tables***¬†[***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29)***.***

tl;dr - Cardano wins May, BTC still way ahead, ETH solidly in second place, NEM (anyone still remember NEM?) still in basement.  Markets going up despite world on fire.  3 x $1k investments in crypto in 2018, 2019, 2020 are down -7% compared to the US stock market.  Word.

## Month Twenty-Nine ‚Äì Down 79%

While not quite as strong as¬†[April](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28/), May was undeniably a strong month overall, especially with the last minute push that saw¬†**Bitcoin**¬†climb over the $10k mark. Although¬†**BTC**¬†(and the market overall) has fallen in the last few days while I‚Äôve been compiling¬†[these updates](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), we saw almost every 2018 Top Ten crypto end the month of May higher than where it started.

#### Question of the month:

##### [The¬†Bitcoin¬†halving took place on May 11th, 2020 at 7:23 PM UTC](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/000000000000000000024bead8df69990852c202db0e0097c1a12ea637d7e96d). Since the first Bitcoin block was generated in 2009, how many halving events have occurred?

A) One  
B) Three  
C) Five  
D) None of the above

*Scroll down for the answer.*

## Ranking and May Winners and Losers

Half of our 2018 Top Ten group were on the move in May.¬†**Cardano**¬†made the most upward progress, climbing two positions to #11.¬†**IOTA**¬†picked up rose one spot in the standings to #24 as well. On the other side,¬†**NEM**¬†keeps slipping, losing three spots to #30.¬†**Dash**¬†and¬†**Stellar**¬†also dropped two positions each in May.

The overall drop out rate remains at the 50% mark (meaning half of the cryptos that¬†[started 2018 in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†have dropped out).¬†**NEM, Dash, IOTA**,¬†**Cardano**, and¬†**Stellar**¬†have been replaced by¬†**EOS, Binance Coin, Tezos, Tether,**¬†and¬†**BSV**.

***May Winners***¬†‚Äì¬†Massive month for¬†**ADA**, up an impressive +62%. That‚Äôs about what¬†**Cardano**¬†gained last month, so, yeah,¬†**Cardano**¬†is having a great spring.¬†**IOTA**¬†also had a solid month, up +28%.

***May Losers***¬†‚Äì¬†¬†**XRP**¬†lost about -4% making it the worst performing of this group in May.

How has your favorite crypto fared over the first 29 months of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment? Most monthly wins (7):¬†**Bitcoin**. Most monthly losses (5) is a now tie between¬†**Stellar**¬†and¬†**NEM**. All cryptos have at least one monthly win and¬†**Bitcoin**¬†stands alone as the only crypto that hasn‚Äôt lost a month (although it came close in¬†[January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty-five/)¬†when it gained ‚Äúonly‚Äù +31%).

## Overall update ‚Äì BTC still way ahead, ETH firmly in second place, NEM worst performing.

**Bitcoin**¬†made up more ground in May, now down -23% since January 2018. The¬†[last time we saw this price level](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/)¬†to end a month was August 2019. The initial $100 investment is now worth about $77.

**BTC**¬†is still well ahead of the field and¬†**Ethereum**¬†is firmly in second place. This may feel like a foregone conclusion at this point, but for context, long time 2018 Top Ten Experiment followers will note that this has not always been the case. Just¬†[a little over a year ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-fifteen/)¬†for example,¬†**BTC**¬†was second place behind¬†**Stellar.**

**NEM**¬†(down -95%) is in last place. That initial $100 investment in¬†**NEM**? Now worth $4.74.

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

The overall crypto market added about $35B in May 2020, back near August 2019 levels. This is down about half from January 2018 when the market was worth roughly $575B.

## Bitcoin dominance:

Another flat month for¬†**Bitcoin**¬†dominance, which hasn‚Äôt moved at all in the last three months.

For context, the range since the beginning of the experiment in January 2018 has been wide: a high of 70% BitDom in September 2019 and a low of 33% BitDom in February 2018.

## Overall return on investment since January 1st, 2018:

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio gained about $20 bucks in May 2020, back near where it was at the end of¬†[February](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty-six/).¬† If I cashed out today, my $1000 initial investment would return about $205, down -79% from¬†[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

Here‚Äôs the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month:

The streak of nine consecutive months down at least -80% was finally broken in May. Just barely (at -79%), but hey, I‚Äôll take it.¬†[July 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-nineteen/)¬†was the last time the 2018 Top Ten finished a month in the negative seventies. What about the negative¬†*sixties*? That level hasn‚Äôt been seen¬†[in about two years](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-seven/).

Painful stuff. What about the follow on Experiments? Let‚Äôs see:

* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17/): up about +43% ($1,432)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5): up about +47% ($1,467)

So overall? Taking the three portfolios together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line:¬†

**After a $3000 investment in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my portfolios are worth¬†$3,104‚Ä¨.**

**That‚Äôs up about +3.5%**¬†for the combined portfolios. Better than a few months ago (aka¬†[the zombie apocalypse](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27/)) where it was down -24%, but not yet back at January (+13%) or February (+6%) levels.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The stock market (as measured by the S&amp;P) continued to recover in May. It‚Äôs pretty amazing with all that‚Äôs going on in the world, but the market is already back up where it was in February 2020. The initial $1k investment into crypto on¬†[New Year‚Äôs Day 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†would have gained about $140 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.

This is where it gets interesting. Taking the same drop-$1,000-per-year-on-January-1st approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I‚Äôve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018: +$140
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019: +$220
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020: -$50

Taken together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:¬†

**After three $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,310.**

That is up over**+10%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), compared to the¬†**$3,104**¬†value¬†(**+3.5%**)¬†of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

That‚Äôs about a 7% difference in favor of the stock market.¬†[Last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28/), there was only a 3% difference.¬†[The month before,](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27/)¬†the gap was 13%.

## Implications/Observations:

No news here: the 2018 Experiment‚Äôs focus of solely holding the Top Ten Cryptos has not and has never been a winning approach when compared to the overall market. The total market cap is down -51% from January 2018 compared to the¬†**-79%**¬†for the cryptos that began 2018 in the Top Ten. This of course implies that I would have done a bit better if I‚Äôd picked different cryptos ‚Äì but much better than if I‚Äôd put all my eggs in¬†**NEM**‚Äòs -95% basket, for example. To reiterate, at no point in this experiment has this investment strategy been successful: the initial 2018 Top Ten have under-performed each of the twenty-nine months compared to the market overall.

In the following two Top Ten experiments, it‚Äôs a slightly different story. There are a few examples of this approach outperforming the overall market in the parallel¬†[2019 Top Ten Crypto Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17). For the most recent 2020 group, this approach had outperformed the overall market 100% of the time‚Ä¶[until this month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5).

## Conclusion:

The¬†**Bitcoin**¬†halving turned out to be a non event and markets continue to steadily rise despite riots in the US and a global pandemic. We‚Äôre almost half way through a very strange year. As the world changes, what will crypto‚Äôs place be in the new normal?

Final word: Please take care of yourselves, your families, and your communities.¬†[Be excellent to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph_1DODXDU).

Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. I hope you‚Äôve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my¬†parallel projects¬†where I repeat the experiment twice, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of two new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of¬†[January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17)¬†then again on¬†[January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5).

# 0. Staking and methodology

Staking cryptocurrencies is something that may interest a lot of retail investors who do not wish to participate in active trading. Staking allows a coin holder to receive passive income through a reward or forging system.

The number of coins or tokens that you have or the amount you are willing to stake will affect the quantity of staking rewards. It‚Äôs a bit like a savings account but with much greater freedom and a decent profit.

Staking is in its essence basically a form of mining, that rewards the users of the blockchain network, because the users of the specific project chose who their Node operators and ultimately Staking providers are. These operators are called miners for coins like Bitcoin. However, staking uses fraction of electricity and computational power that bitcoin mining needs, while still keeping the network running. Poetry of blockchain engineers.

I decided to make a comprehensive guide that will cover a glossary regarding staking and other blockchain terms. The main take-away should be a closer look at a list of projects that I will compare based on how profitable, prospective and user-friendly they are.

The choice of projects featured includes popular, innovative and original projects. I have either direct experience with these projects or I have researched and tested them out. In my opinion, these projects are relatively low risk.

I studied 40+ projects and eventually limited my choice to 9 blockchain networks. This journey was actually really interesting.

Before starting it, I was staking in 2 projects and I thought the market was flooded with projects covering insane staking rewards and incredible possibilities. I went to the opposite end of what I know from my experience and researched ERC20 staking ‚Äì realizing it is complex and risky.

Therefore, I focused on user experience and risk mitigation. This led to a rabbit hole of discovering new and amazing projects. I slowly started to realize one very common denominator for the best staking projects. All of them are focused on creating technology for block-chain interoperability, deploying their own blockchains and parachaining. Each has its own unique take on how to solve this crucial factor for adoption (covered in Chapter 4). This reasoning is clearer when you understand the difference between Proof-of-work and Proof-of-stake.

The foundation of the tech behind the projects should be a major point of interest when comparing these products over their profitability. One of the deciding factors was also the development activity behind these projects ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub)). That is why extreme profit projects with 0 tech are not listed here.

To make this guide a bit more interesting I had a couple of crypto beginners try out this selection of projects and noted their opinion in the evaluation part of this guide.



Important notes:

* Any project with less than 3% annual rewards is not included (eg. EOS, NEO, TRON, VET, LSK, XLM).
* As mentioned, sometimes there is a risk associated with staking (usually very high-profit types with 20% and more yearly interest). This means that any project that has a risk of losing the staked amount or significant rewards is also excluded.
* ERC20 tokens are also excluded as their staking is more complicated and riskier. DOT and KSM are exceptions because their slashing is negligible for users (not validators, however).
* Exchange staking is included briefly as it also carries a risk but that is mainly in the concept of not your keys, not your coins axiom.
* I decided not to include ETH 2.0 in this guide, because it means locking a large number of assets until it launches (so do your own research after you finish this guide).

# 1. TLDR: Summary for Staking in Native Wallets

I decided to start this post with a summary, because there would be a wall of text before the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù. I hope this summary will motivate you to read through the rest of the post and find the logic and reasoning behind it. I decided not to give any project an overall rank and listed them alphabetically (there is no best to last, that is for you to decide). Instead, I summarized key features, profitability and evaluated UIX (from crypto-beginners) and tech aspects (by studying whitepapers and roadmap completions).

Some projects have grown in a way that staking was always available only in third-party wallet and since that is their native environment, they deserve a place here.

Staking in native wallets will always be the most secure way to stake your coins. Never forget to back‚Äëup your seed phrases.

**If some terminology in this table is not clear ‚Äì head down to the glossary in the next chapter. Every single evaluation category in the table is explained in project overview of Chapter 4.**

Table 1: Native wallet - profitability

|**Project**|Coin|Native Wallet|APY %|Lock-up period|Pay-out|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Algorand|ALGO|Yes|6.5 %|None|Transaction claim|

|Polkadot|DOT|Yes|9-12 %|28 days|Claim (84 days expire)|
|Tezos|XTZ|3rd - party only|5-6 %|None 20 days to confirm|3 days**** |

\*ADA native wallets are developed by third-party but they are exclusive to ADA

\*\* ATOM locking period depends on user but to switch delegation you have to wait 21 days.

\*\* ICX interest changes a lot, can be from 6-30 %, overall is about 10‚Äì16 %

\*\*\* Tezos requires to initially confirm assets for about 14-20 days. So PoS rewards kick in after time, then rewards pay out every 3 days.

# 2. Glossary

Table 3: Essential blockchain terms

|**Term**|**Explanation**|
|:-|:-|
|**Blockchain**|Immutable or permanent ledger (registry) maintained in multiple locations known as **nodes**.|
|**Node**|A software instance on a Blockchain network responsible for participating in consensus, maintaining the ledger, servicing or relaying transactions, or all of the above. A node is the most basic unit and critical part of a blockchain infrastructure.|
|**Node operator**|Person or group of people responsible for maintaining a node. A network refers to all nodes in the operation of a blockchain at any given moment in time.|
|**Network**|Collection of nodes that communicate with one another to form a system.|
|**Transaction**|An exchange of data or value between Blockchain addresses or networks.|
|**Consensus**|General agreement between node operators on the state of the Blockchain and/or ledger. In decentralized systems, which are composed of a multitude of node operators the decisions are made collectively.Consensus is needed to provide the state of the network.|
|**Finality**|Property of a Blockchain network that determines how well the consensus mechanism can render new blocks immutable (permanent)|
|**Consensus mechanism**|Method by which consensus is reached, which can vary drastically based on the protocol. Examples include Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and Delegated Proof-of-Stake.|
|**Proof-of-work**|Prime example where this mechanism is used is Bitcoin network. Where miners race to solve complex mathematical problems, adding new blocks and generating new coins to validate transactions. Miners consume large quantities of electricity to do this.|

Table 4: Staking Glossary

|**Term**|**Explanation**|
|:-|:-|
|**APY %**|Annual percentage yield|
|**Ease of staking**|A metric considering the difficulty of set up to earn rewards via staking. Either explaining how hard is it to get your assets to start staking, how much is the minimum amount of tokens for staking and how much attention you have to bring staking.|
|Easy:|Very fast setup, No fees and extremely small minimum stake, none or small lock period, fast payouts and very occasional attention to status.|
|Moderate:|More hassle when setting up staking account, minimum stake required, lock up periods, payouts take longer or require unbonding, can require claiming rewards.|
|Hard:|Abysmal user experience, high entry point, long lock-up periods, payouts after lock-up periods, payouts with long unbounding or claiming, expiration of rewards.|
|**Native wallet**|Wallet developed by the team behind the blockchain project. First functionality of it is built exclusively around the native token. Provides highest amount of security for staking. Many native wallets are expanding beyond and depending on project development allow holding new assets through interoperability, testnet tokens or even top crypto coins.|
|**Third party wallet**|Well known multi-asset wallets like Exodus or Atomic wallet that started to allow staking within their interface.|
|**Exchange staking**|Locked staking on an exchange, there is some risk but can be profitable.|
|**POS**|Consensus mechanism where all coin holders enter a lottery to add new blocks and receive new coins, weighted by the holdings within each address. Consumes far less electricity than PoW.|
|**DPOS**|Consensus mechanism where Staking providers are voted in by coin holders are reponsible for maintaining the ledger, adding blocks, and generating new coins. Since DPoS is a form of democratic governance. The Staking providers share their proposals of how they will share rewards and help the network.|
|**Staking pool**|Pooling funds together with other investors for staking is similar to the concept of pooling hashing power in mining pools.|
|**Staking provider**|Ensures consensus on the network for providing staking rewardsGeneralized name for the terms: Delegate, Delegation services, Delegator, Generator, Producer, Baker, ValidatorSome networks can utilize 2 or more of these specific examples to differentiate roles if needed.|
|**Staking hierarchy**|You are a Voter ‚Äì You vote for Staking pool or Staking provider ‚Äì Staking pool or provider are Node operators (validators) that confirm transactions on the blockchain network and that share the rewards with Voters|

# 3. Native wallet vs 3rd-party wallet vs Exchange staking

Native wallet summary was already included above in Chapter 1 and is the safest form of staking where you own your private keys. I advise to always make good research on how native wallet staking is available for the projects you research.

Third party wallet staking is a good option if you find a reputable wallet. The choice of third party wallets are included in Chapter 4 project overview. In general: Exodus, Atomic, Huobi, Guarda

Table 5:

|**Project**|**Coin**|**3rd party wallet**|**APY %**|**Lock-up period**|**Pay-out**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Cardano**|ADA|Yes\*|4 %|Yes and no|5 days|
|**Algorand**|ALGO|Yes|6.2 %|Yes|After|

|**Icon**|ICX|Yes|10 %|Yes|After|
|**Tezos**|XTZ|Yes|5.4 %|None|3 days|

\*More wallets beyond Daedalus and IOHK

Exchange staking can be useful for some, but dreadful for others. Never forget, not your keys not your coins.

# 4. Project overview and useful links

## Algorand (ALGO):

Algorand is a decent staking project considering profitability and ease of stake. It is so easy that all you have to do is move your Algo to their wallet and you are staking. There is no lock-up period for receiving rewards. They are calculated to your address in a pending form just by being part of the network. To claim them however one needs to send or receive a transaction (even if it is a 0 Algo message over blockchain). Their main goal is to work with banking institutions.

## ARK Ecosystem (ARK):

Very nice profitability and extremely easy to stake in native wallet. Requires only to download their easy-to-use native ARK wallet and vote for a Staking Provider (delegate). The wallet has downloadable plugin for rewards calculation to help chose a delegate based on your voting power.

Ark staking is risk-free. Your assets are never committed or locked and rewards are calculated and paid out daily. So you can see your balance rising everyday and the daily rewards are calculated towards your new staking reward the next day.

ARK has been one of the pioneers in blockchain interoperability solutions since 2017. The team behind ARK has been delivering everything on their yearly roadmaps and has some amazing products lined up for Q1 of 2021. They are very active in development ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub))

## Avalanche (AVAX):

Fairly new project that had main-net launch in Q4 of 2020. As usual around main-net launches the price rocketed and is now consolidating. The staking rewards are decent for AVAX, however, setting up staking accounts is a bit more tricky for beginners. There is a variable lock-up period that the user can freely choose from and rewards are received after this period. They have yet to prove what they promised in whitepapers, but the ambitions are interesting.

Their main net is pretty interesting though: [https://www.avalabs.org/why-avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/why-avalanche)

## Cardano (ADA):

Also a project from 2017 that probably will have the biggest recognition on this list. They never failed to deliver what they promised and should be considered one of the most solid projects in this list.

Their might have one of the lesser staking profitability on this list but they make up for it with the great ease of staking. Rewards are paid out automatically every 20 days and the assets of the addresses are never locked. Calculations are done daily so it considers your transaction history during the 20 days. Therefore it is risk free. Their ‚Äúnative‚Äù wallets Daedalus and Yoroi are easy-to-use.

Some great news are coming from Cardano in the upcoming months so be sure to have them on your watch list. They recently hard-forked to allow more interoperability with chained tokens. They are also very active in development ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub)). They are a Top 3 crypto project for a reason.

## Cosmos (ATOM):

Cosmos has generous profitability and decent ease of staking. The coin can be staked in many wallets due to integration of their SDK in them in order to vote for Staking Pools. The only tricky part is the fact that you have to claim your rewards with a fee to the network.

Cosmos launched in Q1 of 2019 and they just recently finished their first whitepaper and launched their new road map of Stargate. This proves that they can deliver what they promise. They are also very active in development ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub))

## Icon (ICX)

This Korean based blockchain that started of as an ERC20 has very genours profitability and moderate ease of stake. They are deeply embedded in Korean strategic partnerships and seem to be delivering on their roadmap.

They separated from ERC20 base to their on blockchain during 2018. They are now one of the most profitable staking projects.

## Kusama and Polkadot (KSM and DOT)

Kusama is a canary network of polkadot and works on the same principles so I put these together. Both have one of the most profitable stake value in their native wallets and exchange staking. However, the ease of staking in their native wallets is pretty hard for beginners. This coupled with lock up periods and claiming rewards and their possible expiration does not create a good user experience. One could compare that the profitability makes up for that but having it on your mind all the time is a negative experience.

However, they are backed by huge VC and have very ambitious tech lined up. They have yet to prove what they are capable of.

## Tezos (XTZ)

Tezos has an acceptable profitability and moderate ease of staking. There are is an confirmation period of 14-20 days where you commit your adress to a baker and when your assets are confirmed by the network the pay outs roll in every 3 days. You are free to use them and get pay outs very regularly. They are a liquid network so you will have to vote for Staking providers. 

You vote simply by delegating funds to a baker they agree with while bakers(validators) actually cast a vote during the on chain governance process.

Tezos uses a variation of a Proof-of-Stake system that differs slightly from established models in that block producers are not selected by token holders and anyone can participate as a baker (validator) if they hold a specified amount of tokens. Token holders that do not meet the minimum threshold can delegate their tokens to a baker without needing to relinquish control of their tokens.

I've been part of both communities for years, I'm seeing the transformation in both and it worries me.

WSB is fighting hedge funds that are short selling a GME at 120% basically pinning them down and making them go bankrupt by driving the share price up. Kind of a catch22 since shorts don't expire and they have to pay interest on them or buy share to close their positions given that the share price remains high. But investing at this point is activisim or greed depending on your intention, most of the money has already been made.

This story got international attention and I see people got jealous trying to do a pump and dump with DOGE and MOON not understanding that doing so will screw the PEOPLE not the hedge funds!

Our cause is greater, BTC was created as a response to the 2008 crisis denouncing FIAT and the manipulation of currencies through debt, bonds, money printing etc...We have the opportunity to give back the financial freedom that banks took from us, bank the un banked, make transaction cheaper and much more.The difference with most crypto is that they have opportunity to change the world, but we can't be taken seriously when people try to reproduce pump and dumps and then cash out in FIAT not caring who they leave holding the bag. ( spoiler alert it won't be Melvin capital)

It's our responsibility as a community and movement to avoid the mistake that we made in 2017.Invest in projects you believe will work and have value, don't invest out of greed, ask yourself who is this benefiting and does it truly help the world.

PlantWolf,0.0,1047.0,"Some points to newcomers after reading some frightening comments over in r/dogecoin:

¬∑If you don't hold the keys to the crypto, you don't own the crypto. If you can't even withdraw the crypto, you *definitely* don't own the crypto. RH doesn't sell crypto, period. They sell supposed unwithdrawable custodian rights to crypto, and we are hopefully now all aware that RH is full of crap.

¬∑Setting price targets like that of Bitcoin (30k or whatever) is completely nonsensical. Bitcoin has 18M coins out of 21M total possible mined coins. Dogecoin has 128B coins right now, thats 7100x as many. DOGE also doesnt haven't a hard cap due to regularly halving rewards, so its not deflationary in the way BTC is. It would need a market cap of $4Quadrillion to hit Bitcoin levels. In other words, bigger than all equity markets combined afaik. Dollar cost average (DCA) sells on the way up unless you want to drop off the cliff of euphoria into a 50-90% loss like Jan 2018 for a lot of people here. Its already x8 in a week. Bull runs rarely take coins more than x20 or so in a single major rally, and rallies are normally spaced a couple of years or so apart.

¬∑Don't chase rallies. Buying significant positions *after* a 800% rally is a good way to be left holding bags. You should be DCAing buys, not throwing all of your savings at it at once. Its also pretty stupid to be all-in on a 9B mcap coin. That's *high risk gambling* if you're dropping most of your assets into it. It will legitimately most likely throw you into a year or two long depression if you lose half of your savings on Fing Dogecoin.

¬∑Crypto should not be a significant part of your investments. If you're throwing most of your assets in this, and especially at one coin at the end of a major rally, you're not only placing yourself at an insane amount of risk, but you put steady growth of the asset at risk when you inevitably panic sell once the momentum runs out or a big seller enters the market. Everyone in crypto has done this to some degree. Its easy to say diamond hands all you want, and convince a thousand other sardines to buy in, and then have a whale decide they want to sell $200M worth over the next month who doesnt give a shit how it effects you. People have their own motives, and most whales probably aren't on Reddit. The people posting six figure holdings aren't remotely close to whale territory. There's 15 addresses with more than 1 Billion DOGE, and more than 100 with over 100 Million DOGE. Those people could potentially wipe out a rally solo.

¬∑Diversify your bonds. Have other investment vehicles, AND other coins. My favorite analogy is that of a castle. You want to build your castle with stable assets, this is your emergency cash fund, index/mutual funds, *maybe* some large cap stocks, real estate, bonds. That should comprise at least 50%, ideally 80-90%, of your assets. Speculative investments are the raiding party that you send out to loot shit *once the castle is built*. That's riskier stocks, options,  cryptocurrency, etc. Yes, its possible to get lucky if you're solely doing speculative gambling, but its fucking reckless and stupid, and for every DeepFuckingValue, theres 20 people posting loss porn about how they took out a loan for a crypto/options play and got destroyed. It's rolling around with a small army with no defensive position. Really easy to get annihilated by shifting tides in the market, particularly when its all in ONE position.

¬∑Time in the market &gt; timing the market. Quit trying to get rich in 3 weeks, or you'll end up constantly desperate for get rich quick schemes because you never bothered to build a stable base. Having a large emergency fund, and a significant amount of assets because you played it safe is a peace of mind that you cannot know until you have it. Don't throw away the possibility of that in a few years because you wanted to YOLO into Doge and be rich next month.

¬∑The diamond hand thing is really...unconvincing, in case you're wondering. If you're trying that hard to convince yourself and others that you can hang on, you won't. Because anyone who's trying to convince themselves of it is clearly not used to having investments go +100-2000%, especially at the speed that crypto does it, so you won't have any instinct for when to take profits. Greed will set in, and you'll convince yourself that it can survive any correction, and you'll still be waiting for the quick recovery once it drops 60-80% and sits there for 2 years. People who do well in this market have limited exposure, and thus can basically forget about their coins for months or years, because they have other investments and secure finances whether crypto does anything or goes to 0. Euphoria and blind optimism doesn't keep someone holding until something goes x100+. Indifference, apathy, and patience are the more frequent catalysts, because you arent checking Blockfolio every 20 minutes and goading yourself into a panic sell when it corrects hard or crashes. Living in an emotional state thats constantly tied to whether the market is red or green blows. Most of us in crypto experienced at least a little of that in our first year or so. In a away, its exciting because the risk doesn't let you focus on anything else, but its a horrific way to live. The mania eventually gives way into broke disillusionment if you don't have at least a partial exit strategy.

Good luck and be safe. I'm sure this sub would really prefer not having to sticky the suicide hotline number again

Edit: please take note of ajaxhacker who has posted numerous comments to this thread spamming amc, nok, gme. This is shilling 101. ""We the people have spoken""...lmao. Okay buddy. If the people had actually spoken it would involve financial regulation, not trying to make a quick buck. You think we haven't seen this crap before? People were doing this nonstop in 2017 with crypto. Your know what happened? Whales gobbled up everyone, a few shrimp got minted into sharks, but mostly...the rich got richer. Institutions will happily take profits off these before all retail investors have the opportunity to. Who, once again, don't give a shit about ""holding the line with their diamond hands"" and you losing money, because they've been holding since fall of last year and are already +10s of millions or whatever. Don't be naive and don't get stuck holding bags. This type of sentiment is your worst enemy in trading and is one of the earliest and most painful lessons in speculative markets.

zimmah,0.0,1043.0,"# What is NEO / GAS?

Neo is a smart contract network, similar to Ethereum or Binance Smart chain.

# What makes NEO and GAS unique?

**Two token model**

Unlike other smart chains, Neo has a unique concept where the main token NEO, is actually not a coin (although it can be transferred), and it is not used to pay Gas. Instead, GAS is used as a coin, and NEO is used to vote and to generate GAS.NEO can be seen as a dividend-paying share with voting rights.GAS can be seen as an alternative to ETH or BNB. It's the native coin of the network, and used to pay GAS/fees

**Passive and sustainable income**

NEO will passively generate GAS. Some GAS is newly minted (a diminishing curve until the max of 100 million GAS is reached) and other GAS is the GAS that is used for fees. With holding NEO you're basically a miner, without having to actually mine. It's completely passive income that does not inflate the price of the coin.

**Voting**

NEO holders can vote for committee members and validator nodes, so NEO holders can ensure the network governance stays decentralized and managed by people they trust.

**Efficient consensus algorithm**

NEO uses a consensus algorithm that is by design a little bit less decentralized. Now this may sound bad at first, but let me explain why this is actually a good thing.

Centralized - decentralized is not a binary choice, rather it is a scale. Instead of being 100% centralized or 100% decentralized, you can pick a value somewhere in between. NEO picked a value a little bit closer to the centralized side, but it is still decentralized. Now why does this matter?

It matters  because of the blockchain trilemma. You may know of the very common trilemma of ""choose two: cheap, fast, good"", blockchain have a similar trilemma, ""choose two: decentralized, scalable, secure"". Now NEO choose to slide a bit more to the side of centralization (while still being decentralized) to allow a bit more room in the scalability side, without making concessions to security.

It's important to note that NEO still has all the benefits of being decentralized, but it's also important to consider what level of decentralization you personally are happy with. Is NEO decentralized enough? that's something only you can decide.

How efficient is NEO? NEO can in practice reach 1000 tx/s on layer 1 easily, that's not even considering layer 2 solutions. Compare this to Ethereums 15tx/s on layer 1.

# What are the competitors?

Ethereum is the main competitor. It's currently facing scaling issues due to its high popularity. ETH 2.0 should help with this issue, but NEO is a great alternative in the meantime, and it has other advantages even after the launch of ETH 2.0

Another competitor is BNB or Binance smart chain. It's very similar to ethereum, which makes it a popular choice to port solidity apps to BSC. However, since it is so similar to ethereum it will face exactly the same scaling issues.

Other smart contract platforms exist, such as TRON, Cardano, etc. but most of them don't have a working smart contract yet or don't see much use.

# What advantages does NEO / GAS have over the competitors?

Most of them have been mentioned above in what makes NEO/GAS unique.

**Developers can use mainstream programming languages to develop on NEO**

Neo allows developers to use common programming languages like javascript, python, java, kotlin, C#, F# and others, while ethereum requires solidity. This makes the barrier to entry for developers a lot lower.

**Build in oracles and build in filesystem**

Oracle services (similar to chainlink) and filesystems (like SIA) are built-in to NEO.

**Scalable gas fees**

The network can react to GAS prices by lowering the GAS fee on a protocol level. This means all contracts will require less GAS to use, which makes the fees affordable even when GAS prices rise.

**Capped supply**

NEO and GAS have their supply capped at 100 Million. NEO currently has around 70 Million circulating supply, while gas has 10 Million circulating supply.

# What are some common worries?

**China**

NEO is a coin that was made in china. This worries some people. However, it can also be a benefit. China is a huge market, with lots of money, and Chinese people tend to support Chinese companies. This gives it a very strong home base. And since NEO is decentralized, just because it was invented in China doesn't mean that China can control it. If the NEO holders vote for committee members outside of China, there is nothing China can do to harm NEO in any way.

**Centralization**

While NEO scores lower on the degree of decentralization, it is still very much decentralized, and it has a governance model where NEO holders can vote and thereby participate in governance (indirectly by voting in or out committee members and validator nodes).

**NEO becoming unaffordable**

Since NEO is not divisible, people fear it may be out of reach for many people. However many exchanges still allow you to buy fractional NEO (even though you can't send them to your wallet, nor use them to vote, but the exchanges do usually pay you the GAS). Also, if you can't afford NEO, you can always buy GAS. Buying GAS is similar to buying ETH or BNB.

**It's not listed on some exchanges**

Binance is the biggest exchange that lists it (but not in the USA). This may be because exchanges aren't interested in NEO, but it's probably for another reason.

Exchanges probably are not legally allowed to sell NEO because NEO is like a security. Also since NEO generates GAS, many users expect the Exchanges to give them the GAS they generate (most exchanges that DO trade NEO also give you the GAS you generate).

This is also an opportunity because if in the future more exchanges list NEO, this will really explode the price. Don't count on this to happen though, as NEO isn't like most other coins. Also make sure you're legally allowed to hold securities, or accept the risk if you aren't allowed.

Personally I think it's your money and you should be able to do with it what you want, but take care of yourself ok?

GAS may be more likely to be listed at more exchanges because GAS is definitely not a security.

# What can make NEO / GAS explode in value?

Both NEO and GAS are hard-capped at 100 Million tokens each. NEO currently has a supply of about 70 million, while gas has a supply of about 10 million.

NEO 3.0 is about to launch, which will bring some improvements to the protocol.

The NEO network is several orders of magnitude below its competitors despite actually have a working product that scales well. (literally 100 times cheaper than EOS and 4700 times cheaper than Ethereum)

If NEO can even get 5% of the users that Ethereum CURRENTLY has, GAS would increase in price by 235 times! The risk-reward ratio is massively skewed. If NEO would reach their Tx/s limit just like ethereum, gas would increase in value by a staggering 313,000 times. A potential upside of 313 THOUSAND times, that's insane value. And that's not even considering scaling in the future. That's just assuming at some point NEO would reach the limits of what it  CURRENTLY supports.

As long as NEO gets even a fraction of the users that Ethereum has, which is not so hard to believe since NEO is one of the few competitors to Ethereum that ACTUALLY have a functioning product RIGHT NOW, and Ethereum right now has fees in the double or triple digits, the price of GAS and NEO will absolutely skyrocket.

# NEO/GAS, which one should I buy?

***NOTE: NEO is not divisible, while most exchanges allow you to buy fractional NEO, you can NOT send a fractional NEO to your wallet, and you WONT be able to vote with a fractional NEO, although some exchanges do give you your share of GAS for fractional NEO. GAS is divisible.***

Buy NEO when either of the below is true:

* You believe in the Neo network and believe it will be more popular
* You intent to personally use the Neo network a lot in the future, and want to have a passive source of GAS to pay fees with
* You want to speculate on the price of NEO

Buy GAS when:

* You actually intent to use the neo network right now, but aren't sure you want to continue using it a lot in the future.
* You can't afford a full NEO (note NEO isn't divisible, but GAS is)
* You want to deploy a smart contract on NEO (note, you might be able to save on GAS costs by using MCT)
* You want to speculate on the price of GAS
* You are worried NEO being counted as a security and therefore prefer holding GAS if you're not legally allowed to hold securities.

Market caps of competitors:

|Name|Market cap (in billions)|
|:-|:-|
|GAS (native NEO fee token)|$0.047|
|Ethereum|$221|
|BNB (Binance Smart Chain)|$40|
|Polkadot|$29.5|

When in a Bull market like the one we are in now you almost can‚Äôt go wrong! Take Doge for example. The danger is that it gives over confidence and many start to FOMO in money they cannot afford to lose.

So try and remember a couple of key rules that could save you a lot of money:

- Don‚Äôt invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose.
- Don‚Äôt invest money you might need in the short term. Anyone who held its Bitcoin through the drops at this point is in profit.
- Certainly do not borrow to invest
- If you are late to the party consider Dollar Cost Averaging (google it)
- At some point BTC is going to create an ultimate ATH for this market cycle and then correct back down by 70 to 80%. Other crypto‚Äôs will drop even more.
- Yes it will correct back down a very big percentage. Usually 80% (look at previous cycles) It could be triggered by a stock market correction when there are no more stimulus checks. Stock market is already dangerously over priced. (Google Stock market cap Vs GDP).
- You can ‚ÄúDodge‚Äù that correction by progressively taking profits each time BTC creates and new ATH. You want to have cash when the big correction comes.

## Month Thirty Five ‚Äì Down 56%

[2018 Top Ten Summary - Still only BTC in green](https://preview.redd.it/fizjwfc3jz361.png?width=902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9026f7e9225d81dacf1766bab7251a645d759df5)

Whew, quite a month for crypto.¬† After a modest¬†[October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), the cryptocurrency market took off in November, and took off¬†[bigly](https://youtu.be/DJruzDNNHL4?t=22). Although¬†**Bitcoin**¬†received much of the press,¬†**BTC**¬†was outperformed by most of its 2018 Top Ten Portfolio peers this month.¬†

Taking a look at the 2018 Experiment as a whole, after 35 months,¬†**Bitcoin**¬†remains the only crypto in the green.¬† It is now +48% since¬†[January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†and is returning more than the S&amp;P 500 over the same time period (much more on that below).¬†**Ethereum**¬†is coming up fast to the break even point as well, now down only -16% since the beginning of the experiment.

## Question of the month:

#### Which crypto was ahead after the first year of the 2018 Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment?¬†

A) Bitcoin

B) Ethereum

C) Stellar

D) XRP

*Scroll down for the answer.*

## Ranking and November Winners and Losers

[2018 Top Ten Rank](https://preview.redd.it/0i525d0djz361.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=131e19d434e288baac3bd3c527600d5ff86dc621)

Lots of movement in November: except for¬†**BTC**¬†¬†and¬†**ETH**, everyone changed rank.¬† And mostly positive changes for this group of older coins:¬† besides one place slips from both¬†**IOTA**¬†¬†and¬†**Bitcoin Cash**, the rest of the movement was upward and solidly so.

**XRP, ADA, LTC, NEM, Dash,**¬†and¬†**Stellar**¬†all advanced in the rankings. The highest climbers this month?¬†¬†**Stellar**¬†climbed an impressive six spots from #17 to #11 and is once again knocking on the door of the Top Ten. With little media attention¬†**Dash**¬†quietly had a great month, also gaining five spots from #30 to #25.¬† And¬†**NEM**¬†gained five places and regained a spot in the Top Twenty moving from #24 to #19.¬†

*PSA for the other NEM hodlers who might be out there somewhere in the universe:* there‚Äôs a NEM Airdrop coming, which may have something to do with recent positive price action and rank movement. XEM holders will get 1:1 Symbol (XYM) in January 2021.

*Back to our regularly scheduled program‚Ä¶*

**Drop outs:**¬†After thirty-five months of this experiment 40% of the cryptos that¬†[started 2018 in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†have dropped out.¬†¬†**NEM, Dash, IOTA**, and¬†**Stellar**¬†have been replaced by¬†**Binance Coin, Tether**,¬†**LINK**, and most recently,¬†**DOT**.

***November¬† Winners***¬†‚Äì¬†**XRP**¬†easily outperformed its 2018 Top Ten peers, finishing the month +175% and wrestling the #3 position away from¬†**Tether**.¬†

I was curious last time¬†**XRP**¬†had such a good year, so I went back through three years of data for you, dear reader.¬† When was the last time in the 2018 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment¬†**XRP**¬†had such a good month?¬†

Never.¬†

The closest it got to November 2020‚Äôs outsized gains was when it finished +65% in September of 2018, over two years ago.

**Stellar**¬†was on fire as well, up +156% and nearly breaking back into the Top Ten.¬†

***November Losers***¬†‚Äì¬†¬†**BCH**¬†was up +18% for the month, making it the worst performing crypto of the group by far.¬† A bit of a tough luck loss for¬†**Bitcoin Cash**, but it simply couldn‚Äôt keep up with the rest of the field.¬† Second worst performing was¬†**IOTA**¬†(+39%) followed by¬†**Bitcoin**¬†at +43%

For the overly competitive nerds, below is a tally of the winners of the first 35 months of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment.¬†**Bitcoin**¬†still has the most monthly wins (9) and¬†**Cardano**¬†in second place with 6 monthly wins.¬†**NEM**¬†has lost 8 months, the most out of this group.

Every crypto has at least one monthly win and¬†**Bitcoin**¬†is unique as the only cryptocurrency that hasn‚Äôt lost a month yet since January 2018.

[2018 Top Ten Monthly Ws\/Ls ](https://preview.redd.it/k3p9a7nujz361.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c47074dffc8888c9bf0ebcac85d49d2f9c414bc)

## Overall update ‚Äì BTC returns surpass S&amp;P, ETH in distant second, portfolio nears -50%, IOTA in last place.

It‚Äôs taken nearly three years, but it‚Äôs happened: for the first time since the Top Ten Experiment began, I can report that putting $100 into¬†**Bitcoin**¬†on January 1st, 2018 has returned more than the US stock market as measured by the S&amp;P 500.¬† After finally breaking even in¬†[October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34)¬†(**BTC**¬†ended October +4%, the first time it finished in positive territory), it significantly increased its gains in November, ending the +48%.¬† While this monthly performance failed to keep up with the rest of the 2018 Top Ten in November, it was more than enough to surpass the gains of the S&amp;P, which is up +35% over the same time period.¬†

To sum up:¬†*$100 into*¬†***Bitcoin***¬†*on January 1st, 2018 is currently worth $148 compared to $135 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P on New Year‚Äôs Day, 2018.*

**ETH**¬†is still a distant second place, but made significant gains in November and is within striking distance of the break even point, now down only -16% since¬†[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**¬†

The 2018 Top Ten portfolio as a whole?¬† Down -56%.¬† If you‚Äôre just finding these posts now, that sounds horrible, but actually represents the highest point since¬†[May 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-five/).¬† More details and a summary table below.

Thanks to a strong month,¬†**Dash**¬†has narrowly escaped the bottom, replaced by¬†**IOTA**¬†which has lost -90%. The initial $100 invested in¬†**IOTA**¬†35 months ago is worth $9.74 today.

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

[2018 Market Cap - finally higher than when it started 35 months ago](https://preview.redd.it/61222wh9kz361.png?width=709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=512a09f5d9f70af91b9c186bb89eb763804efb56)

Another first for the 2018 Top Ten portfolio: after gaining a massive $182B in November, the overall crypto market is now at¬†*a higher level than when the Experiment started nearly three years ago*. It‚Äôs only up +1% but definitely a milestone.¬† It‚Äôs been a tough road back though: you get a pretty good sense of the journey by looking at the table above.

## Bitcoin dominance:

[2018 Bit Dom tracking](https://preview.redd.it/72fvw29ekz361.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c564761c316aabf80b46762454754e8af6afc782)

After a big leap last month, BitDom fell about one percentage point in November, signaling altcoin gains.¬† For context, BitDom was 68% earlier in the year and since the¬†[beginning of the experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), the range of¬†**Bitcoin**¬†dominance has been quite wide: we saw a high of 70% BitDom in September 2019 and a low of 33% BitDom in February 2018.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018:

[2018 Top Ten ROI](https://preview.redd.it/p6sovyhhkz361.png?width=335&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24db80cb3cb5cfbfc0d866305e962d75d733f14f)

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio gained about $171 bucks in November and is getting tantalizingly close to the halfway back point.¬† If I cashed out today, the $1000 initial investment would return about $435, down -56% from¬†[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

For newcomers, welcome.¬† 

Also, yes, being down -56% on crypto in nearly three years sounds bad (and it is), but for some perspective it might be helpful to take a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month:

[2018 Top Ten Monthly ROI](https://preview.redd.it/iem5olskkz361.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10daa4bbe67f28058141696d94bff4069accc5ad)

Looking at the table, you can see that returns are trending in a positive direction and -56% is a level that hasn‚Äôt been seen since May 2018.¬† The absolute worst month to hold the 2018 Top Ten?¬† Back in January 2019 when it was down¬†[\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

So the Top Ten Cryptos of 2018 are down -56%. What about the¬†***2019***¬†and¬†***2020***¬†Top Tens? Enough beating around the¬†[bush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Qwtv5hCBk), let‚Äôs take a look:

* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +143% (total value $2,432)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11): up +129% (total value $2,287)

So overall? Taking the three portfolios together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line:¬†

**After a $3000 investment in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my combined portfolios are worth $‚Ä≠5,154‚Ä¨**¬†($435+ $2,432 +$2,287).

**That‚Äôs up about +72%**¬†for the three combined portfolios, compared to +18%¬†[just last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34).¬†

Not a bad month for the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments!

Here‚Äôs a table to help visualize:

[Combined Three Year Top Ten ROI](https://preview.redd.it/phuvstptkz361.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=036eb160277e3165b14361f2e937c1e102d99937)

That‚Äôs a +72% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for three straight years.¬†

But surely I would have done even better if I went all in on one crypto, right?¬†

Let‚Äôs take a look.¬† Only five cryptos have begun each of the last three years in the Top Ten:¬†**BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,**¬†and¬†**LTC**. Which one wins?

[Three Year Club](https://preview.redd.it/7zgjlzxwkz361.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4dc70b3f68e035e2b1aaa24d87e21dc50b6c01)

**Ethereum.**¬†¬†Going all in on¬†**ETH**¬†with $3,000 USD (dropped in $1k chunks on January 1st three times in a row since New Year‚Äôs Day 2018) I would be up +237%, turning that $3k into over $10k. Going all in on¬†**Bitcoin**¬†would have yielded +216%.¬†¬†

At this point in the Experiment, each individual crypto has outperformed the +72% gains of the Top Ten Index Fund approach except¬†**BCH**¬†which is only up +19%.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. Despite all the chaos of the US elections, the S&amp;P 500 Index rallied significantly and set a new all time high this month: it ended November up +35% since January 2018.¬†

[Monthly S&amp;P since Jan. 2018](https://preview.redd.it/e2v0knlzkz361.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c093764531e9cedbe396d90143e5c8e2eea24fb)

The initial $1k investment into crypto on¬†[January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†would have been worth about $1350 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.

But what if I took the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I‚Äôve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments? Here are the numbers:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1350 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1440 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1120 today

Taken together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:¬†

**After three $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,910.**

That is up¬†**+30%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+72%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.¬†¬†

You can compare against five individual coins¬† (**BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,**¬†and¬†**LTC)**¬†by using the table above if you want.¬† The key takeaway? The S&amp;P 500 is currently underperforming the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio each of the cryptos in the Three Year Club except for¬†**Bitcoin Cash.**

Here‚Äôs a table summarizing the three year ROI comparison between crypto and S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

[Combined 3-year ROI vs. S&amp;P](https://preview.redd.it/zdzhelu2lz361.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82d278b9ace7b67f3715127e750acd7e24e6e738)

That‚Äôs seven monthly victories for the S&amp;P vs. four monthly victories for crypto in 2020.¬†¬†

But crypto has held the momentum in the second half of the year and has opened up the largest gap of the Experiment so far: an impressive +42% difference in November, even as stocks saw all time highs.

## Conclusion:

Despite US election confusion and an explosion of new COVID cases in November, both traditional and crypto markets had a strong month.¬†¬†**Bitcoin**¬†received the most attention, but alts did very well too, even some of the more established cryptos that make up the 2018 Top Ten portfolio.¬† One more month to go in 2020.¬† Are we in for a bit of a correction or can crypto climb higher before year‚Äôs end?¬† Stay tuned.

Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. I hope you‚Äôve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment twice, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of two new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of¬†[January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23)¬†then again on¬†[January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11).

For the newer folks around here, **build your portfolio's foundation around projects that you believe are solving a real life problems**. I'm not saying you can't save some money for the potential 100x's out there, but back those moonshots up with a foundation of solid projects first.

Here's why...When the euphoria and excitement of the bull market inevitably comes to end and we find yourself returning to the days of -50%, -75%, -95% from ATHs, you will start to lose faith in those heavy ass bags of shitcoins you've collected. Some of those coins will die, many more will never see their ATHs again. When you watch your portfolio shrivel up like testicles in a cold swimming pool, you'll ask yourself, ""What went wrong?"" ""Was it something I said?"" ""Will I ever financially recover from this?"" You might sell for a huge loss or you may chose to hold those heavy ass bags forever. **But the worst case scenario is that you cut all loses and leave the crypto space only to return to buy at the next ATH**.

Anyone who's made it through the last few years will tell you, the bear market is the best time for accumulation. You don't get a $5k Bitcoin, $80 ETH, $2 LINK, or $.0001 DOGE in the middle of bull market mania. You get those prices by researching and learning when others have cut their losses and start playing scratch offs instead. Staying focused and remaining confident in your investment decisions will ensure you're still here to pack your bags for dirt cheap and letting everyone else is jump in late to buy your $200k Bitcoin.

So how do you stay focused and confident in your investments? By finding the real fucking projects out there.

When things start going down, you want to look at your bags and say ""yeah, regardless of the current price, my coins still have a lot more intrinsic value"". Maintaining that confidence and excitement in the space and in your projects will keep you involved, researching, and learning about other blockchain projects during the bear market.

What makes a good project you ask? I don't think there's any one size fits all answer but here's some factors I look for to get you started.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **What problem do they claim they are trying to solve?** Does that problem seem like a real problem, or like a problem they invented so they can solve it? Do they actually solve the problem? This on takes a bit of intuition and common sense, trust your gut, be critical, and be impartial. Don't make it something it's not.
2. **Is the token actually needed to solve that problem?** Sometimes a company may be solving a real problem but the coin they created is kind of just a symbolic gesture of this and doesn't actually assist in the solution. The intrinsic value in the token is directly linked to the problem it solves.
3. **Do they have a working product?** I think there are plenty of projects that don't have a product now but will in the future. It doesn't mean they're less valuable, I'm just saying that if a bear market comes and the dev team wallet is down 90%, are they going to stay motivated to deliver on time? That I'm not sure of so I factor that risk into my investment decision.
4. **Is the project still being worked?** Look I get it, not every project is going to be completely fielded and working right this second. Look at the roadmap and see what they have planned. Look for their Github and see if they are actively working it. If you see that's been over 6 months since anyone has worked it, that project might be dead. Join the projects telegram and ask questions about the development.
5. **Do they have meaningful partnerships?** Pretty much every shitcoin out there will have at least a dozen or so partnerships. If you don't know what their ""partner"" is, look it up to see if it's really any value added. If someone says they patterned with Tesla, look it up to make sure they aren't claiming that Elon tweeting ""I like XYZcoin"" is a real partnership.
6. **Tokenomics.** This is a broad one so I'll break down some key areas.

* *Total Supply:* How many coins will ever exist? Does that make sense to you? Does a currency project with an unlimited supply sound like a good idea to you?
* *Circulating Supply:* How many coins are released as of today? If only 10% of coins are distributed so far, I might not be eager to invest because when the new coins are released, they could flood the market and tank the price. I don't always write off a project based on shitty circulating supply, but if the allocation method or incentives don't support it, I'm out.
* *Token Distribution Method &amp; Allocation*: How were the initial tokens distributed. Does it seem fair and trustworthy to you? How do future coins get added and over what time period?
* *Token usage incentives:* Are there incentives for having the coin? Do you get staking reward? Many projects nowadays inject supply to current holders, stakers, liquidity providers etc. This type of incentive may justify a low circulating supply if that's how they plan to distribute the remaining tokens.
* *Marketcap:* Not really a factor in it determining if it's a good project or not but will help you gauge growth potential.

**Conclusion:** There are dozens of projects out there doing amazing things but there are also hundreds of coins that will ultimately be worthless. If you're starting out with $50, $100, or $1000 now and you're bummed you might not be rich after this bull market ends, please try to take my advice. Having coins that are solving problems and exciting to you will keep you around during the next accumulation phase and then maybe in the next bull market you can cash out and by your lambo.

But hey, I don't know everything. I welcome those with more experience than me to share their advice for find solid projects as well.

Pdvsky,0.0,963.0,"Hello everyone! 

I've realized that a lot of people, specially new ones in this community don't really have a lot of knowledge about these terms and what each of them mean, so I decided to try to make everything clear so that people don't expect completely unrealistic things(like doge is going to reach 1000 USD)

So first things first what does each of those words you find in websites like coinmarketcap and coin gecko mean? Let's understand one by one:

**VALUE**

The value of a coin is the last price someone paid for that coin, note that it doesn't need to be a ""whole"" coin you can buy 0.0001 coin but the value is always stated as a whole coin. 

EXAMPLE: 1 BTC = 37.791 USD this is how much the last BTC transaction cost to the buyer corrected for 1 BTC. ( So if he bought 0.1 BTC he paid 3.7791 USD)

**CIRCULATING SUPPLY**

This is the amount of a coin that can be exchanged at the moment.

EXAMPLES: 

BTC = 18,618,562 
ETH = 114,525,091

Note that BTC circulating supply is way lower then ETH which means there is less bitcoin in existence now than there is Ethereum(this is very important)

**TOTAL SUPPLY** 

Total supply is the amount of a coin that can be exchanged + the amount that is locked(but already exists). NOT the amount that will be available in the future.

**MAX SUPPLY** 

This is the total amount of a coin that will ever exist.

NOTE: some coins DON'T have a max supply as there will always be new coins generated. Ex:. Dogecoin

**MARKET CAP** 
Market cap is a simple multiplication of the value of a coin with its circulating supply

Example: BTC: 37,791 USD x 18,618,562 = 703614076542

As you probably already know Bitcoin is the number one Cryptocurrency in existence today and that is NOT because it has the highest value, but because it has the highest market cap.

That is why 62% of the crypto value is in BTC, because that's the amount of money that is invest in that coin considering the amount of coins in existence.

so for Ethereum to surpass bitcoin its value DOESNT need to go 40k it needs to go to 6143 (at the current supply)

Just so you guys understand how absurd is the idea of doge reaching 100 USD, were that to happen at the current circulating supply (note that doge supply is always increasing quite faster then BTC and ETH) it would have a market cap of 12.8 trillion dollars which is 12 times more than all money invested in all cryptocurrencies at the moment. Oh but how about 1 dollar? Then it would be 128 billion.

**Conclusion** 

DON'T BUY A COIN BECAUSE THE VALUE IS LOW, check the market cap for growth but also check the technology and how other people might be interested in buying that coin as well.

In other words the market doesn't give a shit how smart you think you are, you either need the ability to wait or you should not be in it.

""The market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term.""

If you have time to wait then you'll see another cycle happen. If not, then you shouldn't be in it.

Proponents of decentralization aren't happy that CZ and Binance dishonestly promote their network as decentralized and 'DeFi', with a number of rumors about just how many of BSC's 21 nodes are operated by Binance (some say 11, others have said all 21, some say just a few). 

After CZ has started bashing Ethereum and artificially infalted ETH gas fees by making all withdrawals pay 10-30% more than ETH gas station's 'highest' rate, it appears that proponents of decentralization have struck back.

They've launched a DeFi/farming app on BSC about the Tiananmen Square massacre, presumably to force CZ to remove it and end BSC's charade as a 'decentralized' blockchain.

myhaxdontwork,0.0,921.0,"Hype and increasing prices will undoubtedly attract new investors, HODLers, and gamblers. Regardless of how long you've been in crypto, below are a few pieces of information (or reminders) you should consider.  


1. **We're still early**. Cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, is still in its infancy. Because of this, we will continue to see headlines of hacks, exchange closures, big name investors coming into the space, major institutional adoption, and everything in between. Until crypto is regulated (for better or worse) and even after, there will be bad actors attempting to steal your cryptocurrencies. To that end, think twice when hearing about 'deals' or investments that seem too good to be true. They probably are.  

2.  **Protection**. I often see questions regarding the storage of cryptocurrencies. Not to oversimplify, but as a user, you have \~3 choices to store your cryptocurrency. In order of most secure to least secure:
   1. **Cold Storage** \- From wikipedia: **Cold storage** refers to storing **Bitcoins/Cryptos** offline and spending without the private keys controlling them ever being online. This resists theft by hackers and malware, and is often a necessary security precaution especially dealing with large amounts of **Bitcoin.**   
If you aren't comfortable manually storing your private key, physical hardware wallets are your best alternative. When possible, buy direct from the manufacturer to avoid any tampering to your new device.
      1. [https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/)
      2. [https://www.ledger.com/](https://www.ledger.com/)
   2. **Hot Wallets** \- From [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hot-wallet.asp): The difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet is that hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not.   
Hot wallets can be installed onto your mobile device and/or your web browser. Similar to cold storage, these hot wallets will 'store' your crypto and will be accessed to send/receive tokens, execute smart contracts, and conduct other transactions. There are many options to choose from, but MetaMask is as close to an industry standard as it comes, and the developer has recently implemented an ERC-20 token swap function. Again, download directly from the developer if you can.
      1. [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)
   3. **Exchanges** \- Exchanges certainly have their own purpose, most notably as an on and off ramp for your fiat currency (e.g., US Dollar, etc). However, when you read headlines like ""Bitcoin Hacked for 10 million dollars!"" what they usually mean is, a centralized exchange that holds users' cryptocurrencies was hacked and bitcoin was extracted from the exchange's storage. For this reason, exchanges are considered to be less safe than your Hot Wallet and Cold storage alternatives.  

3. **Don't be greedy**. This is easier said than done, and many veteran traders have learned this the hard way -- some still haven't learned. When prices are only going up, you're going to feel like a million bucks. **But things dont go up forever**. **Ever**. (Unless it's the Fed's balance sheet.. har har). Point being, it's okay to take profits along the way up. I guarantee you'll have an opportunity to re-buy those same tokens at a cheaper price, and you'll enjoy them even more the second time around.     

4. **Don't spend more than you can afford**. Hopefully this goes without saying, but the crypto space is extremely volatile. It is not uncommon to lose your entire investment with just one wrong token/ICO/scam. To that end; just use your common sense. It sounds easy, but when you're making money, sometimes it's hard to see the cliff at the end of the road.  
 
5. **Keep learning**. I joined the crypto space because I saw an opportunity to make money. It's been a wild ride, and I've learned a lot more than I've gained (from a monetary perspective). What i didn't expect to happen, was to open pandora's box when it comes to what Bitcoin (specifically) aimed to solve. My thirst for knowledge only expanded when I learned of the opportunity space Ethereum was trying to fill. Compound that with the immutability of blockchain technology, DeFi, smart contracts, data oracles, (and the list goes on); now I'm completely hooked. It's clear to me that blockchain will revolutionize the way we function on the global scale. But many are just now beginning to learn about bBitcoin, and we're ahead of the curve. Which leads me back to point number 1; we're still early. 

  
Sorry for rambling on here; I'm sure more veteran HODLers have already X'd out of this post, which is fine. They likely don't need this information as they have learned these same tips along their own journeys. But for newcomers to the space, I wish I had this foundational knowledge from the get go. Don't be afraid to ask questions on this sub. With the recent implementation of MOON tokens (this is a whole 'nother topic), I've personally noticed more downvotes than normal.

In case you happened to miss it, the short version--that I gather is not an uncommon scam--was that rumors of this telegram investor group that planned on pumping and very specifically not selling XRP to keep its value rising. People were told the pump was going to happen on Monday, at 8:30am. 

I bought into the hype -- having missed out on GME and Dogecoin I was in a really ""I want to get into investing"" mood and was *certain* that this was gonna be it. Everywhere I looked about this was filled with memes about going to the moon with it and really positive talk, and everywhere that was *not* filled with memes had almost no discussion on it. Which honestly makes me realize is part of the issue; the only places I heard about this in where also places where you were made to feel crazy for not buying into the hype. It was a really bad feedback loop.

Fortunately I stumbled upon a few discussions on this subreddit about it and it helped me take a step back and think about the logistics of it. I thought about it a lot and looking outside of my bubble really helped me realize how I wasn't investing, I was positively gambling. I had no idea about XRP as a technology and was buying it solely as a quick get rich scheme which was a terrible idea. The many stories people had here about how pump-and-dump schemes worked to prey on overly excited newbies helped me realize that I *was* the overly excited newbie and I wasn't a weird exception, I was just being driven by FOMO and hype. 

I had bought in when it was at .4, and last night when I was up late reading this subreddit and realizing I had screwed up it was going up by a lot, at .67. I set up a stop limit at  .65 and went to bed, woke up realizing how close I had come to losing a lot of money.

Now to be clear, I did do some reading and I think that XRP could be an interesting coin to invest in. But not the way I did it and not for the reasons I did it. I want to say I dodged a bullet, but instead it‚Äôs more accurate to say you guys pushed me out of the way when the bullet was on its way to me. I really appreciate that. In the future, I‚Äôm going to invest in crypto when I legitimately believe there is a long term possibility of growth based on the technology and opportunities instead of trying to ride the wave.

These are fascinating times for Bitcoin prices.

We've never had the leading cryptocurrency trade for this long at [these levels](https://twitter.com/coinfomania/status/1336360484929490946).

Think about it. Traders will use the price movement we see in these last few days in the years ahead to draw their charts and decide what the market would do next.

I picked out this one because of its beauty and how it is pointing to the fact that Bitcoin is becoming less volatile.

The first stint above $18,000 barely lasted for a day and the second was already over in less than 72 hours. The last two cycles above $18,000 have happened in the current bullish market cycle, and I hope it doesn't break before I post this (lol).

Either way, it has been an interesting ride, and we all will be closely watching for what comes next.

With all the institutional involvement we've had this year and PayPal's involvement, one can't help but be bullish about Bitcoin going into the new year.

And no, I'm not going to end this post by making any wild predictions or say we're never going to see $10k Bitcoin again.

I did it because of bonuses, and free airdrops. Also Walton coin was new and I had to drop my pants for it because everything new that got listed on binance had moon potential.   

You know it, if it was newly listed on Binance , just like mini versions of coinbase rumors of XRP being listed, that crypto got instant credibility.

Back to what I was saying.   BNB came out and obviously nobody would imagine that shit being 300+.      Everyone knows anything less than $10 was not transferable or tradable. Was $10 min.    So everyone was left with dust. 

I decided to sign onto all these accounts . And between the 2 old accounts I abandoned I'm sitting on over 15 Binance tokens.  Along with an additional  $100s in dust on BTC and other things.

I don't know what the FK I was thinking.  A few months back I was short on money and didn't think once about my dust.    Now I'm finding out my thousands of moons are actually worth about $0.10 ea???

While Bitcoin, Dogecoin and ETH are getting all the hype right now, it is important to learn about other players in the market with potentially better tech.

NANO is a direct competitor to LTC and Bitcoin. Nano was created in order to be used in transactions and make them free and instantaneous.

There are multiple advantages to NANO when compared to other competitors:

1. Fee-less

Unlike many other cryptos, nano is fee-less. This is a major advantage to other crypto‚Äôs, especially since Bitcoin can get really expensive really fast. In 2017, a Bitcoin transaction could cost over $40 and take 2 hours to complete. This is a major drawback for small everyday transactions. It could be argued that Bitcoin is a store of value, and should not be used for small transactions but it does go against the original thesis of Satoshi.

2. Instant

Nano is essentially instantaneous and that is extremely important for small every day transactions. I recommend opening two nano wallets and sending money back and worth to truly appreciate the speed of the network. 

3. Eco-friendly

I think this is a huge point that many people overlook. With the rise of Bitcoin, more and more power is dedicated to mining/processing transactions, and at a certain point the cost of doing so will be insane. With Nano, thousands of transactions can happen at the same time without the insane energy consumption that we are all used to seeing. 


Conclusion:

These are just a few advantages that new people should know about NANO.
If the goal is to truly make a convenient crypto that lets people to freely transact, there is a strong argument for Nano technology.
Additionally, the team is fairly experienced and has been around for over 4 years now.
Good luck, and happy investing.



EDIT: A few people asked, but NANO is a fully built out network. It has been available for use since 2015 (called raiblocks), and has gone through multiple stress tests.

EDIT 2: There is a lot of healthy discussion going on, but also a few people think I am shilling for the coin. To be honest, I will be holding this crypto for a long time. I did not expect this post to take off, if I did, I would make it more detailed.

littleboy0k,0.0,814.0,"This post is a gentle introduction to new cryptocurrency users about cryptocurrency price swings. Many of you may have brought Bitcoin when it went up above 20000$ or higher. At the time of writing this post, 1 Bitcoin = 46200$.

You may have seen your cryptocurrency balance go up 20%, 30% or even 100%. This may have made you interested in buying even more Bitcoin. ""It keeps going up and up, I should buy even more to maximize my profits"", this is the thought I had when I entered the cryptocurrency market in 2017. You may get similar greedy thoughts in your head.  


This is a perfectly expected behavior considering all the positive news you have heard recently about Bitcoin. You have heard Elon Musk talk about Bitcoin. You have seen his tweets promoting Bitcoin. You trust him and think that other large billionaires will probably buy more Bitcoin, which will send it to 100k by July!!!

You may have seen BitBoy and other youtubers say Ethereum is going to 2500$, Bitcoin to 75K or 80K or even 250K!!! To be honest, I was exactly like you on January 2018. I was really hyped about this, though I was smart enough to sell my Ethereum at 1200$ which was my largest holding. I than brought some stupid useless altcoins and you may have done the same recently after selling some of your Bitcoin to buy other smallar coins.  


But you need to understand that something that can go up 40% a day can also dump 40% a day. Let me give you and example with the price of petrol or gasoline. You may have observed that the price of gasoline doesn't always stay the same. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. But the price generally doesn't fluctuate too much.

Here, cryptocurrencies also work exactly in a similar way. Though the price swing is much higher because crypto trades 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Because it can be transferred instantly, it has a higher price volatility.   


So, if you think it can only go up, you are na√Øve. Higher price volatility means that when it goes up, it goes up really high, but **when it goes down, it goes down really high as well**.

One strategy to protect yourself against such price movements is to average your costs. That is instead of buying crypto at once, you split that into 12 (for example) chunks and buy every month. If you check the price of Bitcoin for the last 12 months, you will realize that if you brought BTC this way, your average price per Bitcoin would be around 15000$ - 20000$ (I didn't do the exact math).

Hence, now that BTC is 46k, you are up over 240%. This is a much safer strategy for new investors. Also, Bitcoin in 2018, went up to 19k and then went down to around 4k, which is about a dump of 80%.

So, it wouldn't be impossible for it to go down back to 10k by going down 80%. I am writing this because I don't want you to make the same mistakes I made though you will still make some mistakes and loss money xD, I know it. After losing a lot of money did I learn to manage my risks. I hope you have a much better experience with your crypto journey.

jam-hay,0.0,811.0,"As a avid follower and supporter of both crypto and musk, I don't think the Doge fans quite realise that he's taking them and all crypto for a sarcastic ride.

If you've followed Elon's thoughts on crypto you'll know he's long been a cynic.. even at a time when he was applying his cunning satire to make out he was a doge fan.

Recently many could have been mistaken for thinking Elon has had a change in heart towards crypto.. I was the same.

However his consistent shilling of Doge is making it clear that it's just Elon's warped sense of Twitter humour at play and by pumping doge in tweets he's just taking the piss out of doge and crypto at the same time.

In someways he's correct.. when the world's richest man can pump a meme coin in to the top ten largest cap coins by simply tweeting.. it is slightly embarrassing.

A lot of innocents are going to get burned when the doge gets an injection of reality putting it down.

When that happens.. not one f**k by Mr Musk.. who doesn't hodl any crypto let alone doge.. will be given.

As much as I admire the guy.. he is taking the piss out of crypto here.

Cynics will say.. ahh you were wrong he does support crypto.

Supporters will say.. still no mention of Tesla buying or supporting doge.. so he's still taking the piss/ trolling.

Doge (the world's first anti-alt meme crypto) is now up to number 9 by market cap and only 0.5b away from Litecoin (crypto's oldest most prolific altcoin..) which for many old coiners will most likely be seen as a somewhat of a travesty including Dogecoins original creator.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lfaomo/my_joke_cryptocurrency_hit_2_billion_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Don't get me wrong the original dogecoin era was a laugh and good fun however.... 
For me this like a 50 year old Dad thats just discovered the internet, trying to be all cool sharing memes from 2013.. all a little cringey TBH.. but hey every dog deserves its day in the sun just hope the owners have their sunscreen on to avoid getting burned ;)

Side note: Interestingly Elon switched his crypto tweets from pumping doge to pumping BTC back to pumping doge around the time it looks like they've bought bitcoin.. it will be interesting to see if this could be classed as 2021 crypto style market manipulation in any way.. Elon may have been worried about it so hence the #bitcoin being removed from his bio and a switch back to doge to be safe not so long ago.

¬Ω cup Sour Cream

2 TBS Heavy Cream, Half-and-Half or Whole Milk

¬Ω cup Mayonnaise

1 ¬Ω teaspoon Worcestershire

¬Ω teaspoon Kosher salt - plus more to taste

¬º teaspoon Pepper - plus more to 

Cook the bacon until it is crispy.  Pour off all grease, minus 2 tablespoons

Add onions and aromatics.  Cook for a few minutes until translucent.

Grease an 8 inch baking dish (preferably ceramic) and preheat oven to 350.  

In a large bowl, combine the bacon mixture with everything else except a quarter cup of cheese.   Stir well and plop into the baking dish.  

Sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top and bake for 20-25 minutes until all nice and bubbly.  Pro-Tip: Toss it under the broiler at the end for a minute or two to brown it nicely

gdj11,0.0,801.0,"When there‚Äôs big dumps in the markets, you always hear things like, ‚Äúa whale just dumped $XXX million dollars of bitcoin in 10 minutes!‚Äù That is almost never the case. It‚Äôs true there are usually large events that trigger it, but you need to understand how trading bots and stop losses work. A stop loss is a certain price at which a trader, usually with the assistance of a bot, will decide their losses are too much and will sell their crypto to prevent even greater losses.

For example let‚Äôs say bitcoin is at $45k, and a bot has a very conservative stop loss set for $43k. Then say there‚Äôs some price swings that bring the price down to $43k. The bot will now instantly dump its crypto to prevent further loss before the market goes down even further.

Now, let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs not just one bot, but thousands. And let‚Äôs say some bots have stop losses in the $44.9k range, and some in the $44.8k range, and so on, and so on. That small market swing which brought the price down to $43k just triggered hundreds or thousands of stop losses. So what happens if there‚Äôs not enough buyers to support all these bots selling? The price continues to drop, and it will drop until it finds enough buyers to support all of these sellers.

Remember these are bots. They are software programs that can trade instantly, so this massive sell-off and dump in the market happened in the span of just a few minutes. To untrained eyes it will look like an instant drop, which they conclude could only happen from a single massive sell, but that‚Äôs not he case.

Traders love times like this. They‚Äôre able to watch the buy and sell volume and estimate when the buying support will sustain the sellers, and that‚Äôs when they start buying. A lot of noobs see a giant red line in the charts and assume it‚Äôs a good time to buy. Don‚Äôt. Traders say, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt catch falling knives‚Äù because if the buyers aren‚Äôt yet supporting sellers, that red line is going to get a lot longer.

This is a super simple explanation, but you should at least be familiar with the concept if you‚Äôre going to dabble in crypto.

Good luck!

EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, a stop loss is a general term. There are different types of stop orders, but actually many bots won't set an actual order for their stop loss because that can affect the market. Instead the bot will constantly monitor the price in real-time and if its stop loss price is reached it'll sell. There's also trailing stop losses, which re-adjust the stop loss as the price increases. For example if you bought at $1.00 and set a stop loss in your bot at $0.80, if the price goes up to $1.20, the bot would re-adjust your stop loss to maybe $1.00. This allows maximum profits even when the price dumps.",CryptoCurrency,Why crypto markets appear to dump instantly - a simple explanation of bots and stop losses,801.0,0.96

Most of these people got lucky, rode the bull to the top, then told everyone they did it based on x, y, &amp; z instead of dumb luck.

Secondly, rich people are risking an extremely small amount of their wealth (or in the case of Elon Musk, his companies wealth, not his own). Sure, it sounds amazing when someone invests hundreds of millions of dollars into crypto. **But they are gambling with a tiny relative amount**.

When the average /r/CryptoCurrency user invests into crypto, they are likely putting a lot at risk in terms of net worth percentage.

When the rich lose, they might not be able to buy their 50th car. When the poor loses, they go without food. The risk is not the same regardless of the raw amount of money lost.

**In summary**: while no one actually knows what they are talking about in terms of crypto investing, you should put more value on the opinion of the person who risks 50% of their $10k net worth vs. the billionaire who puts 0.0001% of their net worth in. The poorer person has more to lose.

Those of you in the US at the moment will know about this really well. You have the 1% (politicians) deciding the fate of millions of people who desperately need a stimulus check.

rasaxar,0.0,764.0," So you think that 10% dip counts as a correction?

Let me give you a helpful hint..

We're not in a correction until the sweat falling down your neck meets the sweat of your ass crack in a pool on your desk chair while your sitting up at 3am staring at a stamp chart 3 inches from your face trying to convince yourself thats its going to reverse any second now. Your hand shaking like a Parkinson's patient over an oily mouse when suddenly you feel the dire need to take a shit but you vomit in your mouth a little bit instead and before you have time to question how those two bodily functions could possibly be related we've already dropped another 20%. You've now got a big red dildo candle showing a 60% loss in a matter of minutes staring back at you as price has dipped far below your buy in spot, all the profits you made over the past several weeks, dreams of that new car, that new house disappear in an instant and you cant imagine what possibly could have caused this.

You default to erroneously blaming the Chinese but that doesn't quite add up so you take to twitter with panicked breath searching for anyone, anything that might have the answer as to what the F is happening. Of course no one has any more of a clue then you do so you immediately start to internalize the struggle. What starts as a whisper of ""why didn't I just sell"" turns into a rampage scream in the back of your mind, after all its so obvious that this was the top, it's so clear now looking back, of course that was the top how the hell didn't I see that 15 minutes ago? Meanwhile we're down another 5% and you just can't take it anymore. Tears are rushing from your eyes, something that looks like dried blood is all over your arm emanating from the spot you didn't realize you were subconsciously digging your fingernail into. You close your eyes just for a moment but when they reopen you realize you've somehow already logged into your Coinbase account and punched in a sell order. Thats it. You sold. Your devastated, but manage to breathe a small sigh of relief. Well at least i can't lose anymore you say, at least i walked away with something. Your emotionally and physically exhausted now but you manage to drag yourself across the room, you fall flat on your bed with one final thought passing through your mind before you let the darkness overtake you...""why didn't i just sell the top?""

In the morning you wake to the realization that you slept fully clothed and at an odd enough angle that your neck is surely going to feel exactly as bad if not worse for the rest of the day. The events of the previous night come back to you in a flurry of blurred emotions and while you almost can't bring yourself to check the price you just have to know. How much lower did it go? After all, there is still a glimmer of a hope, you think well, perhaps it isn't all bad, perhaps I can buy back in a bit lower and make the losses back in the long term. You begrudgingly open a chart and whatever small amount of hope that remained escapes your lungs before the sigh hits your lips. Price has fully recovered, it's actually trading up 10% from yesterdays highs...

Like crypto and numbers?  Or want to detox from the first meme weekend?  Welcome!

*\*Note - price snapshots are always taken on the 1st of each month, so numbers below are before crypto spiked in early Nov.\**

***See the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22/)***.***

tl;dr

* Moons to first one to find the *three hidden cultural references* in this post.
* What's this all about? I purchased $100 of each of Top Ten Cryptos in Jan. 2019, haven't sold or traded. Did the same in 2018 and 2020. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **October** \- **BTC** had a great month, followed by **Litecoin** and **BCH.**  Crypto diverged from traditional markets this month, a welcome change.
* **Overall since Jan. 2019** \- **Bitcoin** (+262%) still far ahead, followed by **ETH (**\+191%). 
* 2019 Top Ten performing best out of the three experiments. 
* *Combining all three three years, Top Ten cryptos are tied with the S&amp;P if I'd taken a similar approach.* 

## Month Twenty Two ‚Äì UP 66%

[ 2019 Top Ten Snapshot for October](https://preview.redd.it/dyvww7tvo7y51.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6a5ec52476b5a70c8eb7ad2457bade21e10df80)

The 2019 Portfolio had a solid month, and was the best performer of the¬†[Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).¬† Most of the cryptos ended October in positive or neutral territory, while the losses of the worst performers were no¬†[biggie](https://youtu.be/b8YmZXdV_BM?t=3)¬†(at least for crypto).¬†¬†

## Question of the month:

#### In early October, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged this crypto exchange with illegally operating an unregistered trading platform.

A) Bittrex

B) Binance

C) Bitmex

D) That other crypto exchange that starts with the letter ‚ÄúB‚Äù

## Ranking and October Winners and Losers

[ 2019 Top Ten Ranking - 40&amp;#37; dropout rate](https://preview.redd.it/em207sj0p7y51.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86910479a129d816378a7b34ea990cce69de5e66)

After losing quite a bit of ground in the rankings in¬†[September](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21), the 2019 Top Ten rebounded a bit in October.¬† Only¬†**BSV**¬†finished down on the month, down two places (from #9 to #11) and dropping out of the Top Ten. The rest either held or climbed:¬†¬†**EOS, Tron**¬†and¬†**Stellar**¬†each advanced one position each and¬†**Litecoin**¬†picked up four places and was able to rejoin the Top Ten.¬†

It‚Äôs good to have¬†**LTC**¬†back in the familiar confines of the Top Ten, as last month it found itself on the outside looking in, for the first time since the Experiments started back in January 2018.

40% of the crypotos that were in the Top Ten¬†[on January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)¬†have dropped out:¬†**Tron, Stellar, BSV,**¬†and¬†**EOS**¬†have been replaced by¬†**BNB, DOT, ADA,**¬†and¬†**LINK**.

***October Winners***¬†‚Äì¬†[Big Poppa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odu--y-ZyoI) **BTC**¬†had a great month, finishing up +25%. Second place goes to¬†**LTC,**¬†up +17% in October, followed by¬†**BCH,**¬†up +14%.

***October Losers***¬†‚Äì The losses were moderate this month, but the L for October goes to¬†**BSV,**¬†which lost -7% and fell out of the Top Ten.¬†**EOS**¬†was second worst performing, down -5%.¬†

For overly competitive nerds, here is a tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and losses during the first 22 months of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:¬†

[2019 Ws\/Ls](https://preview.redd.it/scw2glq5p7y51.png?width=399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=976187a0503571748e2e649498d08a4c4eed5208)

Because it's the default winner in down months, **Tether**¬†is still far ahead in terms of monthly victories (7).¬† That‚Äôs more than twice as much as second place¬†**BSV, BTC,**¬†and¬†**ETH.**¬† And although¬†**BSV**¬†is up 74% since January 2019, it dominates the monthly loss count: it has now finished last in nine out of twenty-two months (paying attention, swing traders?).¬† And¬†**XRP**¬†is still the only crypto that has yet to notch a monthly win.

## Overall update ‚Äì BTC‚Äôs lead increases, XRP back to the basement, 2019 Top Ten pulls ahead of other Experiments.

**BTC**¬†extended the lead it carved out¬†[last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21) over second place¬†**ETH**¬†in October. The top two are up +262% and +191% respectively, followed distantly by¬†**Litecoin**, which is up +79% since January 2019. The initial $100 investment in¬†**BTC**¬†is currently worth $369.

For the first time since April 2019,¬†**BSV has dropped out of the Top Ten.**

Twenty-two months into the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment, 70% of the 2019 Top Ten cryptos are either flat or in the green. After barely escaping the basement last month,¬†**XRP**¬†has once again sunk to the bottom of the pack, down -33% since¬†[January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

At +66%, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio has pulled ahead of the¬†[2020 Top Ten Portfolio‚Äôs](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10)¬†\+61% gain and both are far, far ahead of the¬†[2018 group](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34)¬†, which is¬†*down*¬†\-74% (more on that below).¬†¬†

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

[Total market cap since Jan 2019 is +215&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/4i106i2jp7y51.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ce2fe77b133bc881e3dc0b9f0d8b8a3b96eb771)

Since¬†[January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/), the total market cap for crypto is up +215%. The overall market gained about $50B in October, ending the month just over the psychologically important $400B mark. This is now the highest month-end level since the 2019 Top Ten Experiment began 22 months ago.

## Bitcoin dominance:

[Are you into BitDom?](https://preview.redd.it/vuwr6dupp7y51.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5538d7e011ff30736975528e407650b6f07ffa8)

After spending much of the year locked in the 65% range,¬†**BitDom**¬†took a short break in the summer to [dip it low, but then has picked it up slow](https://youtu.be/5z5Mvyp1QHw?t=46)**,**¬†and has now popped back up to 63%.¬† ¬†As always, a high¬†**Bitcoin**¬†dominance signals less of an appetite for altcoins. Zooming out, the¬†**BitDom**¬†range since the¬†[beginning of the experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)¬†in January 2019 has been between 50%-70%.

## Overall return on investment since January 1st, 2019:

The 2019 Group gained $122 in October, so after the initial $1000 investment, the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is worth $1,660.¬†

[2019 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment ROI](https://preview.redd.it/075cr2qwp7y51.png?width=351&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0f7ff6a10f3ba9f6ddb7cd9eb9bd5c18d56c0f5)

For some context, here‚Äôs a look at the ROI over the life of the first 22 months of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiment, month by month:

[2019 Top Ten ROI summary ](https://preview.redd.it/nwslgejvp7y51.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f77512d509d4ff0929ca9eb3d5b2c742fee3419)

Unlike the¬†[completely red table](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34)¬†you‚Äôll see in the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, the 2019 crypto table is almost all green. The first month was the¬†[lowest point](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)¬†(-9%), and the¬†[highest point](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-five/)¬†(+114%) was May 2019.

At +66%, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is now the best performing¬†[out of the three Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/)¬†but¬†[not by much:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9)¬†the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is up +61%.

Speaking of the other Experiments, let‚Äôs take a look at how the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund Portfolio compare to the parallel projects:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -74% (total value $264)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10): up +61% (total value $1,613)

Taking the three portfolios together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line:¬†

**After a $3000 investment in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my combined portfolios are worth $‚Ä≠3,537‚Ä¨**¬†($264+ $1,660 +$1,613).

**That‚Äôs up about +18%**¬†for the three combined portfolios, compared to +11%¬†[last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21).

Here‚Äôs a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

[2018, 2019, 2020 Top Tens combined ROI](https://preview.redd.it/tfp7rvm1q7y51.png?width=446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a1dd53fb63490122210be87664fead26c16ec9)

To sum up: +18% gain by dropping $1k once a year on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, and 2020.

But what if I‚Äôd gone all in on only one Top Ten crypto for the past three years? While many have come and gone over the life of the experiment, only five cryptos have started in Top Ten for all three years:¬†**BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,**¬†and¬†**LTC.**¬†Let‚Äôs take a look at those five:

&amp;#x200B;

[A tie: BTC catches up to ETH this month for leader of the Three Year Club](https://preview.redd.it/vllfg8c4q7y51.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65aba6ddf0b1baf2b6c29ce67eb86085cf2dd5dd)

Up until this month**, Ethereum**¬†would have been your best bet.¬† As of the end of October, it‚Äôs basically a tie between¬†**BTC**¬†and¬†**ETH**. Both are up +121%, (although BTC is technically $21 ahead of ETH).¬†

On the other hand, if I had followed this world‚Äôs slowest dollar cost averaging approach with¬†**XRP,**¬†I‚Äôd be down -32%.¬† 

With¬†**BCH**¬†I would have just about broken even.¬†

Alright, that‚Äôs crypto. How does crypto compare to the stock market?

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.¬† The S&amp;P continued to fall from an all time high in the summer, and is now up +30% since January 2019.¬†¬†

[S&amp;P since Jan 2019? +30&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/v5lx6a3hq7y51.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2ecd4f61fbe6f849c6b3cae513414cc3d30624)

The initial $1k investment I put into crypto 22 months ago would be worth $1,300 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 in January 2019. +30% is not a bad return at all.¬† But the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up more than double (+66)% over the same time period.

That‚Äôs 2019. But what if I took the same world‚Äôs-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st crypto approach with the S&amp;P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1220 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1300 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1010 today

Taken together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:¬†

**After three $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,530.**

That is up¬†**+17.6%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/). Compared to a¬†**+17.9%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.¬† You can also compare against five individual coins (**BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,**¬†and¬†**LTC)**¬†by using the table above if you want.

It‚Äôs small, but that tiny 0.3% difference¬†***in favor of crypto.***¬† That‚Äôs now seven monthly victories for the S&amp;P vs. three monthly victories for crypto, all clustered in the second half of the year.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

[Crypto re-takes the lead in October....barely](https://preview.redd.it/tpew06ayq7y51.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=880e1682d4207f398030ca137e6dfa284c491490)

## Conclusion:

Thanks mainly to¬†**Bitcoin**, October was a good month for crypto and a good month for the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio. As traditional markets have struggled over the last few months, crypto seems to be headed in the opposite direction.¬† I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing if those trends hold in the last few months of a crazy year.

Take care of each other out there, stay safe.

golden-china,0.0,724.0,"# When looking for a coin that is undervalued, then look no further than Monero.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monero Succeeds At What It Does Best:**

Many people like to jump to conclusion and say ""it is used for drugs"". Monero has no control over what its currency is used for. Monero was made to be private money. Because it succeeded at its privacy features, it started getting used for illicit activities. I do not condone those illicit activities. But that should definitely tell you something. It is really good at what it does.

&amp;#x200B;

**Digital Fungibility Is Important For Cryptocurrencies:**

Monero has default privacy. Why is that important? Default privacy enables digital fungibility. What does digital fungibility mean? Considering tracing companies are doing there best to improve, there are many cases where users get their bitcoins frozen on a centralized wallet or exchange because they didn't like the fact they used those bitcoins in a gambling site. Or simply someone bought the wrong persons bitcoins, because they had no idea what they used it for before. Now imagine being innocent, and losing your funds because of that. A fungible cryptocurrency will make it impossible to taint a cryptocurrency. So 1 XMR will always equal 1 XMR, no matter what it was used for.

&amp;#x200B;

**Millions of dollars spent on violating your crypto-privacy:**

Institutions and corporations spend millions (possibly billions) of dollars building the best software and analytics to track cryptocurrencies. They succeeded in all cryptocurrencies, but one. Monero. If that is not bullish, then I don't know what is. Forget what the media tells you about it, think about the dedication put into it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monero has the third most number of contributors:**

Now where does that dedication come from? It comes from over 250 contributors in the Monero project. Monero has the third most number of contributors (first place: bitcoin, second: ethereum). Every time there was an technical issue, the monero developers immediately fixed it. All these contributors are working extra hard to provide privacy based cryptocurrency that people can rely on. It can be innocent people from third world countries with a suppressing government.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Average 2 minutes block-time:**

Using Monero is awesome too! Average block time is 2 minutes, much lower than majority of currency-based coins.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/17am01zowwg61.png?width=1829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1925e55eb6417f722eeb047edf357dc6420262f

&amp;#x200B;

**It costs pennies to transact in Monero:**

The fee's are extremely low, and do not increase to unreasonable amounts because of sudden usage. The average fees is $0.02 to $0.10.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/isy7km9hwwg61.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdb4c89f8e5dfef281b4e22471513ac48b67dd54

&amp;#x200B;

**Price action:**

Since many of you seem to be focused on the price these days. Here is the outlook right now. Most of the pressure is coming from the $200 sell wall. Once XMR buying power breaches that wall, the momentum should start to pick up like the rest of the market.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gpyovbtnxwg61.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3fc229bf71fab8be887de87503f12f9d15b55a

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly feel that Monero can easily be priced at $500 to $600.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monero (XMR):**

The initial mission for Monero is to create a secure and private cryptocurrency, and they continue to succeed on developing such a cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT BELOW: I am going to add more things to this post because some users mentioned more things that make it undervalued:

&amp;#x200B;

**Monero Atomic Swaps coming soon:**

BTC/XMR swaps are in the works: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i1fknt/ccs\_results\_monero\_atomic\_swaps\_research/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i1fknt/ccs_results_monero_atomic_swaps_research/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Mining is decentralized:**

Monero is ASIC resistant!

&amp;#x200B;

**Grayscale is looking into listing a Monero Trust:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u49d848zdxg61.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ce15d6ee9b4a438abec277386d7cd7683412eec

Moons are distributed every 4 weeks based on contributions people make to r/CryptoCurrency. For every distribution, Reddit publishes karma data as a default measure of contribution. The community can review the data and optionally propose an alternative distribution, if they wish.

This distribution is based on karma earned from 2021-01-20 to 2021-02-16. [Here is the data.](https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/CryptoCurrency/round_10_proposed.csv)

To propose an alternative distribution:

* You can create a CSV with alternative contribution scores or propose changes to the algorithm used to calculate them from karma (as long as the changes can be implemented easily).
* The amount of Moons distributed to a user will be proportional to their contribution score. Contribution scores cannot be negative.

Alexandr Vinnik was jailed recently laundering $4 billion worth of BTC, and that made headlines pretty much everywhere, but none of these outlets are getting into the paramilitaries or oligarchs or any of that stuff. Most of that BTC came from Mt. Gox (!) and that's rarely mentioned. They're making out like Vinnik was just some money guy who broke the rules.

Apparently the Russian federalists who shot down Malaysian Flight 17 and killed like 300 people bought BTC-e when Vinnik got arrested, so they were already involved somehow. The current ""owner"" (the new version of the BTC-e exchange is down now, exit scam) is literally the guy handing over the black box from the crashed plane in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxYmDOe7vE&amp;feature=emb\_title&amp;ab\_channel=LastNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxYmDOe7vE&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;ab_channel=LastNews).

They're all paramilitary fighters/terrorists/whatever. They were funded by this war-mongering oligarch sanctioned by the EU for terrorism in Donbass.

And then there's all the shit Vinnik got up to when he was active. He ended up wanted in three countries, he went on hunger strike, it seems like Russia literally invented charges just to file extradition claims so the US couldn't interrogate him for his involvement in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee.

Seriously, what the fuck is this story?

Crypto Briefing covered it in full, so did this Russian outlet (in Russian).

Who knows what they will look like in 2030? So many studies - and schadenfreude anecdotes - reveal that the people who do best across the world of investing are those who simply hold through everything and restrain themselves from ever trading. (I think there was a famous Felicity study about the stock market that found that dead people's accounts usually outperformed living people's accounts, however I cannot find a source for this upon doing a cursory google search, so if anyone has heard of the same study, please let us know what it was.) My game plan is simply a little bit of euro cost averaging each month for the next few decades, never selling, and using a bit of cash on the side whenever there are huge dips or if a new cryptocurrency with potential pops up and I find myself particularly compelled by it. 

Is anyone else the same? I feel like this should be the textbook method of making the most out of your money.

SpartanNo7,0.0,674.0,"A little background into my experience with crypto to this point. First started in late 2017, with some great highs and real lows (FU Confido) but mostly lots of valuable lessons learnt. My dream was always to make enough to buy a Tesla, never got close but the dream is still there right?

So, 2020 comes and goes, it was a tough year, but we‚Äôve always been fully aware things could be and are worse for a lot of people. My wife is a nurse, and to say it‚Äôs been a stressful time probably doesn‚Äôt do it justice.

Anyway, 2021 started and after a year of saving we finally decided to purchase a puppy that we‚Äôd dreamt of owning for years, a Chocolate Labrador. We discussed it as a family and decided the time was right. Not knowing the demand in the UK is through the roof right now, we started the process of messaging people, phone call responses to adverts until we finally found one available. My son was overjoyed, he‚Äôd gone on and on for as long as I can remember, and we just were never in a position to either afford one or feel like we could give the dog the attention it has to have due to our work commitments.

We had several talks with the owners, couldn‚Äôt visit because of lockdown restrictions, but photos and videos shared. Eventually sending a 50% deposit. Hindsight is everything, and that absolutely should have been a red flag and I‚Äôm still beating myself up for going ahead with it. The guy I‚Äôd spoken to seemed trustworthy, nothing about any part of our conversations made me suspicious. A day or two goes by, and I send of couple of questions via WhatsApp, no replies. I can see they‚Äôre being read, but no replies. Ok, they may be busy I‚Äôll call later. I call, no answer. I call from my wife‚Äôs phone, no answer. Days of phone calls, no answer. We‚Äôve lost the money.

My son is devastated, my wife is a mix of furious and in sheer disbelief. There‚Äôs been a few tears, we‚Äôve reported it to Action Fraud and our bank (who were helpful, but I‚Äôm not expecting to see the money again)

What does any of this have to do with crypto? The puppy we chose was a little cheaper than others (another red flag?) and my wife couldn‚Äôt bare the idea of paying more money, on top of the money we‚Äôd lost.

I then look at my crypto balance. There‚Äôs enough there to cover the cost of a puppy from a trusted seller, with the necessary health checks and paperwork etc. But I‚Äôd accumulated these over years. Always been a believer in Nano, and picked up a decent amount when the price had dropped to &gt;$1. As tough as the decision to cash out was, and this was the first time I‚Äôd ever withdrawn any of my crypto to FIAT, it was absolutely the right thing to do.

So, I did. In what has been a very emotional week, there was light at the end of the tunnel. I can always start the process of buying my coins again, but the happiness of my family since making the decision has been overwhelming.

To that end, please meet Juno Rai, we pick her up in 3 weeks:

I could end up being the BTC pizza guy, but I can‚Äôt put a price on how happy my family has been since I made the decision to pull the plug. I‚Äôm not out of this by a long shot, just starting again.

TLDR; Scammed out of savings for a puppy, turned to my crypto holdings to fill the gap, puppy secured, family delighted.

Spoiler Alert: I actually surveyed 181 /r/CryptoCurrency Redditors, but a nice round number always sounds better! 

Last week I posted a short survey to gather some information about /r/CryptoCurrency users that I could turn into some funky graphs. I now have the final results and must say some really surprised me.

I'd love to do another one of these again with a larger sample size, so if you have any question suggestions, please drop them below!

&amp;#x200B;

**Q1 -  When did you first hear about Cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[As you can see from the results above, during 2013 &amp; 2017 \(bull market years\) there is an increase in users discovering Cryptocurrency. Which makes sense as these are the years where media coverage is at its highest. What surprised me about this result is that I also expected the same for 2020 \(or at least a higher result\) however this was not the case. ](https://preview.redd.it/zoaf0i8gzte61.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baff219f1157fb99a89f511c88dc3572cb821d93)

**Q2 -  When did you first invest in Cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[As you can see from the above, there is steadily increasing growth \(roughly\) year on year with the exceptions of 2017 and 2020. This makes sense as these are the years where talk about Crypto &amp; FOMO is at its highest. However I was interested to see that 38&amp;#37; of people surveyed invested in 2020, however less than 1&amp;#37; heard about Crypto for the first time in 2020. Meaning there could be a year\/multi year gap between the average \/r\/cryptocurrency member discovering Crypto &amp; investing in it for the first time. ](https://preview.redd.it/763txvpp0ue61.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d975373b7b15fe29e70484d21f8935ac9e22a5)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3 -  Have you ever mined cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I think this one is fairly straight forward, and just about what I was expecting. ](https://preview.redd.it/xtiur6sm1ue61.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc67c5e1844b1ae7fa9eef1ec138d6b4a782f41)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4 -  Have you ever staked cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I initially was surprised by this as far more people had staked compared to mining and I personally couldn't remember a time where I had staked Crypto, however I did remember that one of Coinbase Earn's lessons was actually a tutorial where they provide you some COMP for you to stake. This made me realise that it had been so easy, I'd forgotten I'd even done it!  - I think that with staking becoming easier and easier and more accessible to the average user, this figure is bound to go up even higher over the next year or so. ](https://preview.redd.it/ixjplttz1ue61.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72082cc45467ccedf862d620647c198872dc1aee)

**Q5 -   What percentage of your net worth is invested in Cryptocurrency?**  

&amp;#x200B;

[Interesting to see a more even spread across the board than I originally thought, however I was surprised to see that 12&amp;#37; of users surveyed had 90&amp;#37;+ NW invested in crypto. Best of luck to you all, I hope you all reap the rewards of that commitment! ](https://preview.redd.it/s4hcwyqq3ue61.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0821b5f46949fe43304e10f593efa72ea81467b)

**Q6 -  What age bracket are you in?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[If this sample size is reflective of the community as a whole, I'm genuinely shocked that so many users are in the 30-40 bracket. I've always felt that this sub \(and space in general\) is heavily dominated by 20-30 year olds, however its great to see a much more varied user group. Also shout out to the one 60+ year old surveyed! ](https://preview.redd.it/di0cx7um4ue61.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e91c3e7523f065f9d681f2d93a64b414174a79)

&amp;#x200B;

 **Q7 - How did you first hear about CryptoCurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Looks like over 30&amp;#37; of people surveyed heard about crypto through a friend. This makes sense to me as after mentioning crypto once or twice personally, my friends have often come forward to ask me questions and learn a bit about what Cryptocurrency actually is.](https://preview.redd.it/fr482qie5ue61.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=739d2d2a3ea3d236130fbaecd11f87ad69304c91)

**Q8 -  Have you ever recommended Crypto to a friend or family member?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I think this one speaks for itself! Looks like the majority of us love to tell out friends and family about Crypto! ](https://preview.redd.it/29joj02z5ue61.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eefb24f5b30dcebf2a142f49fc1bb9bfe87b6c05)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q9 -  Where do you see the global Crypto market cap in 5 years?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[This question was to gauge sentiment on the market as a whole, looks like the results show that we are all overwhelmingly bullish on cryptocurrency, with not a single person surveyed thinking that crypto will fall to 0! ](https://preview.redd.it/zg0wtjvl6ue61.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0700d79b6a113d20c31f3fce4ab289f69a17f4ac)

**Q10 -  Do you believe regulation is good for cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I was quite interested to see that so many people surveyed didn't have an opinion on regulation for cryptocurrency. Regulation has seemed to become an increasingly debated topic around here, so its interesting to see so many people yet to have an opinion! ](https://preview.redd.it/kptg23dz6ue61.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80367ffdad5479aab2a9822f7672d162418edcfa)

**Q11 -  What do you hold more of, BTC or Alts?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Again, this one interested me! When people in the sub ask where to start, I often see a big chunk of people suggesting allocating the largest percentage of your portfolio to BTC. So its really interesting to see such a large proportion of people surveyed have a portfolio that is more heavily weighted with alts.](https://preview.redd.it/xgshaabm7ue61.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d36720deac402f9349cfa70b6ef30b1cd82e117)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q12 -  What price do you think BTC could reach in the next 12 months?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Another market sentiment question, however I do admit I completely forgot to add a sub 50k option, so I unintentionally skewed this whole set of results in a bullish light. Sorry!!](https://preview.redd.it/qp2b1a5a8ue61.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f52ac8a8cbeaa8cb08e20ccd328a7b45aeac8c6)

**Q13 -  Have you ever participated in an airdrop?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Not too much to say on this one! Great to see so many getting involved in airdrops! ](https://preview.redd.it/5k9jz29l8ue61.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbc4290803380bfcb68728942a48cd997b43f872)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q14 -  What would you feel more comfortable investing in? Cryptocurrency or stocks?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Not surprised at all by this one, As this survey was conducted in a cryptocurrency sub, I was expecting this to be weighted much more heavily to crypto, I'm sure the reverse would be the result in a personal finance sub!](https://preview.redd.it/sugsgdpx8ue61.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcb65ba50a1879b8cb9fa70a9658c53dc4636f4)

**Q15 -  Do you think BTC will still have the highest market cap in 5 years?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I was really curious about this one and to see how many people thought that BTC might be dethroned as number 1. To be honest I was actually expecting many more people to think that an Alt may be number 1 in a few years, especially as so many here have more skin in alts than BTC! ](https://preview.redd.it/8y9xkipf9ue61.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c9a2be33d8c90ef534c67fac1ac9c0b3b0384aa)

**Q16 -  Do you trade cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I was really interested to see how many people surveyed actually trade, even if its just rarely! I've always been under the impression this sub is weighted much more heavily towards a buy and hold \(HODL\) strategy. ](https://preview.redd.it/wjuc2rw2aue61.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272182739d6be085f475046da0d204bb7916911e)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q17-  Do you hold any DeFi related projects?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm not surprised to see that so many here hold DeFi projects, with the big DeFi boom over the last year or so its unsurprising that many of us want a piece of the action! ](https://preview.redd.it/si5mif7jaue61.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db8cd9dc8133ae4adde0677339e630973ac4d738)

&amp;#x200B;

**The End!**

I hope that this was informative, I really enjoyed putting this together and I just want to thank everyone who participated! It would be great to get some feedback and question ideas below as I think running another one of these with new questions and a larger sample size would be really interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

LivingThings37,0.0,661.0," Here are some interesting facts or history about the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. A lot of it is taken from the wikipedia. Feel free to correct me if something's wrong.

**Bitcoin (BTC)**:

The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ‚Çø10,000.

**Ethereum (ETH)**:

In 2016, a hacker exploited a flaw in a third-party project called The DAO and stole $50 million of Ether. As a result, the Ethereum community voted to hard fork the blockchain to reverse the theft and Ethereum Classic (ETC) continued as the original chain.

**Cardano (ADA)**:

The platform is named after [Gerolamo Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano) and the cryptocurrency after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace).

**Binance Coin (BNB):**

BNB was launched through an initial coin offering in 2017, 11 days before the Binance cryptocurrency exchange went online. It was originally issued as an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network, with a total supply capped at 200 million coins, and 100 million BNBs offered in the ICO.

**Tether (USDT):**

Despite being ""tethered"" to USD, USDT sometimes lost a part of its price per coin. The biggest price drop happened on April 25, 2017, when the price almost got to 0.9 US dollars per coin. As a result traders sold USDT coins, making the price of USDT much lower. Some of the cryptocurrency exchanges (particularly those that implemented Tether as a USD alternative) experienced a rapid Bitcoin price uptrend. The same happened with other cryptocurrencies, traded in pairs with Tether.

**Polkadot (DOT)**:

Gavin Wood was previously the Chief Technology Officer and is co-founder of the Ethereum Project. While developing Ethereum and developing the new Ethereum 2.0 specification that would include sharding, Dr. Wood and his team began pondering the sharding hurdles a blockchain would face. From initial conception to a white paper, it took him about four months to come up with a vision for a heterogeneous multi-chain framework, the Polkadot Protocol. Wood released the Polkadot white paper on November 14, 2016.

**XRP**:

A class action was filed against Ripple in May 2018 ""alleging that it led a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through unregistered sales of its XRP tokens."" According to the complaint, ""the company created billions of coins 'out of thin air' and then profited by selling them to the public in 'what is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering'.""

**Chainlink (LINK)**:

~~The launch of the open-source cryptocurrency ChainLink was not successful. The fault was the mistake of the developers in informing investors and in carrying out collective cooperation, in order to raise money and other resources to finance this project. Thus, after the launch, the program worked only 10 minutes, but because of the failure of the company, users accused the creators of cheating.~~

**Litecoin (LTC)**:

In May 2017, Litecoin became the first of the top 5 (by market cap) cryptocurrencies to adopt Segregated Witness. Later in May of the same year, the first Lightning Network transaction was completed through Litecoin, transferring 0.00000001 LTC from Z√ºrich to San Francisco in under one second.

**Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**:

In 2017 there were two factions of Bitcoin supporters: those that supported large blocks and those who preferred small blocks. The Bitcoin Cash faction favors the use of its currency as a medium of exchange for commerce, while the Bitcoin-supporting faction view Bitcoin's primary use as that of a store of value. Bitcoin Cash detractors call the cryptocurrency ""Bcash"", ""Btrash"", or ""a scam"", while its supporters maintain that ""it is the pure form of Bitcoin""

**Stellar (XLM):**

Jed McCaleb is a co-founder of Stellar Development Foundation . Before the official launch, McCaleb formed a website called ""Secret Bitcoin Project"" seeking alpha testers. Also ,in 2000, McCaleb created e-Donkey which became one of the largest file-sharing networks in its time. He later created Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, which was subsequently sold and re-coded by its current owners.

**USD Coin (USDC):**

Unlike the most popular stablecoin Tether (USDT), creators of the USD Coin are obligated to provide full transparency and work with a range of financial institutions to maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency. All USDC issuers are required to regularly report their USD holdings, which are then published by Grant Thornton LLP. All the monthly attestation reports can be found [here](https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency).

**Uniswap (UNI):**

Uniswap was born out of an idea proposed in reddit in 2016 by Vitalik Buterin for a decentralized exchange (DEX) that would employ an on-chain automated market maker with certain unique characteristics. A year later Hayden Adams began working on turning this idea into a functional product. After receiving several grants as well as $100,000 from the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap launched in November 2018.

**NEM (XEM):**

In January 2018, Coincheck exchange was hacked and approximately 500 million NEM tokens ($530 million) were stolen. The currency was transferred through a total of nineteen accounts, one of which was found to have no connection with the hacker. On March 12, the exchange announced reimbursements for the victims, some 260,000 holders.

**Dogecoin (DOGE):**

On January 19, 2014, a fundraiser was established by the Dogecoin community to raise $50,000 for the Jamaican Bobsled Team, which had qualified for, but could not afford to go to, the Sochi Winter Olympics. By the second day, $36,000 worth of Dogecoin was donated and the Dogecoin to bitcoin exchange rate rose by 50%.



**EDIT**: Some additional info about Cardano and Ada.

Gerolamo **Cardano** was an Italian polymath, whose interests and proficiencies ranged through those of mathematician, physician, biologist, physicist, chemist, astrologer, astronomer, philosopher, writer, and gambler. He was one of the most influential mathematicians of the Renaissance, and was one of the key figures in the foundation of probability and the earliest introducer of the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem in the Western world. He wrote more than 200 works on science.

Augusta **Ada** King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as one of the first computer programmers.

In 2012 I was in university studying Computer Science.

There was a classmate who was obsessed about bitcoin, always talking about it. 

I remember him talking to me every day about bitcoin. He even gave me some software to mine bitcoin by myself, I didn't even try it because I didn't care. I don't remember a lot because I just thought it was boring so I didn't listen to him. 

On summer 2012 he decided to quit the university and to move to East Europe to open a mining farm. 

He offered me to move with him and become business partners but I refused. So he offered me to go there just for one month to help him to set up the infrastructure. 

He offered me about 2000‚Ç¨ so I initially accepted. 
But there was a catch: he didn't have cash because he spent everything on this project. He offered me the equivalent in bitcoin: 200btc for working 1 month. 

I asked him why he couldn't convert btc in euro and he said it was quite complicated, so I thought that if it was complicated for him, it was impossible for me. 

I told him I was sorry but I wasn't interested in working 1 month and getting paid with money I couldn't spend. 


I never cared about bitcoin in these years. I even almost forgot about this story. 

Last week I saw my ex classmate on a TV show where a reporter interviewed him about bitcoin. I discovered that he actually opened that mining farm and he became an entrepreneur. 

After I saw him I remembered about this story and I checked how much is worth a bitcoin. 

If I understood well, if I accepted and kept those 200btc now I would be a millionaire. I even discovered that there are now a lot of websites where I can easily convert bitcoins in euro or just trade bitcoins. 

I'm literally shocked, I feel stupid and I would like to do something about it but clearly I lost the train and now it's too late.",CryptoCurrency,In 2012 I refused 200 btc because I thought they were useless,653.0,0.93

Esslemut,0.0,646.0,"Just a little anecdote about my relationship with crypto and what it has done for me.


I don't come from a wealthy background. enough to get by and to have some luxuries, but very much working class. I first heard about Bitcoin in 2012 and passed up on buying 10BTC at $10 each because the exchange required ID and I couldn't be bothered. I've lived with that regret ever since, and have foolishly kept to the sidelines observing crypto from a distance. recently I decided to invest for the first time, for the reason that I don't want to live with that regret for the rest of my life. I'd rather lose money I can recover than wonder ""what if?"" for the rest of my life. 


anyway, after lots of research on crypto I settled on a split of Cardano, Nano, and Bitcoin. I've been mining banano using at folding@home, lending out my processing power to help advance medicine and earning the banano cryptocurrency in doing so. I feel like I'm a part of something much larger than myself. if you're not aware of banano or folding@home for crypto I highly recommend checking it out: /r/banano. It's a great concept with a strong community and it's a great way to get people into crypto, as banano (it's a fork of nano) transfers instantly, no fees, it's kid-friendly and laid-back. lots of fun. btw, if you're new to banano and are interested in it send me a message and I'll send you some banano :)


anyway, what started as a small investment turned into a second savings account. the benefit crypto has had on me is twofold:


1. If I had the money in my bank account, I would feel tempted to spend it if I had a higher than usual amount. By locking away crypto in a wallet and treating it as a long term investment, that money won't be spent on a whim. as a result, my crypto wallet after 3 weeks has more in it than my savings account did at its peak (profit aside)


2. cryptocurrency in general gains value over time. instead of just having a savings account that I don't touch and whose value decreases over time due to inflation, my cryptocurrencies gain value. a 5-10x price increase over the next several years is not unreasonable. 


I've never had hope for my future, financially. I resigned to living a poor, working class life a long time ago. I never thought I'd have any money. with my increasing levels of chronic pain, I've begun to worry that I may not be able to work for much longer.


Crypto has changed all this. I now have so much hope. I have a savings account that is decentralised and isn't through a corrupt bank (always hated banks, so crypto makes sense). and that savings may well 10+x over the next however many years. if it did that, I may never have to work a job I don't want to ever again. I'd be able to rest easy, not worrying about getting through each work week with chronic pain. 


crypto can change my life forever. but more importantly, it can change the world forever. it's exciting, and a privilege to be a part of this. it truly is a once in our species opportunity.


thanks for reading this long, pretty self-centered post. feel free to share your own experiences/give any input, I'd appreciate it.


edit: thank you but please buy crypto instead of reddit awards! buy nano and set up a wenano faucet for others to use, buy banano and participate in the giveaways, buy cardano and stake it for 5% return, buy bitcoin and don't touch it for another decade. but don't buy reddit awards. thanks, though!",CryptoCurrency,Crypto has given me real hope for my financial future for the first time in my life.,646.0,0.95

After Richard Heart himself decided to comment on the post telling me he deserved a Nobel Prize for his creation I decided to look up what I could find about this man hiding behind a fake name.*

**Drama from the last post:**

Richard Heart decided to share my post in the HEX Telegram group talking about 'No one will probably see the post because of the downvotes'. This resulted in dozens of HEX shillers sliding into my DM's saying disgusting things and massively downvoting my post. Guess what, **I can't be silenced. Even if it's just one person I can convince thats enough for me.** So, after clearing out the drama it got me last time I did this post, lets dive into Richard Heart.

**Who is Richard Heart?**

From a debate in 2017 between Roger Ver (Bitcoin Cash) and Richard Schueler it becomes clear that Richard used to be a hardcore Bitcoin believer and pointed out many Ethereum protocol flaws, ranging from poor coding to bad decisions in terms of programming language implementations (cryptoinsider). About a year and a half later Richard comes up with his coin, HEX. it is promoted to be a better bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain (oh, the irony). In the middle of the bearmarket and Richard being the largest participant in his own coin he convinces his following on Youtube to HODL the coin after mysterious dumps. You can find [here](https://i.redd.it/duecf980osf41.png) what is happening with the Ethereum when you purchase HEX.

**Legal and questionable events from** **Richard J Schueler:**

2002: Sued and won by [Peacefire.org](https://Peacefire.org) for violating Washingtons anti-spam laws, he was known at that time as the 'spam king' and made a lot of money off it - [source](https://www.zdnet.com/article/peacefire-org-beats-spammers-in-court/). The Methuselah Foundation, for which Heart volunteered at that time, was committed to extending the human lifespan and ‚Äúmaking 90 the new 50‚Äù.

Questionable events in [Panama](https://web.archive.org/web/20171223110716/https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79y40b/scammer_alert_you_know_the_narcissist_guy_who/): Several of Heart‚Äôs alleged aliases (James Hart, J. Richard, Richard Schueler) were named in connection with a Panamanian criminal network. Heart, called ""CharityLover' at that time supposed cohorts included robbers, blackmailers and corrupt lawyers and judges, according to posts stemming from the now defunct Panama-Guide website . Miguel Antonio Bernal (Panama lawyer) described the process by which American criminals flooded Panama to ‚Äúrob, cheat and blackmail local businessmen using Panama‚Äôs weak legal system'' in the linked post under ''Panama"".

AltsAreTrash,0.0,599.0,"A comment in the daily today reminded me of this Instagram post by pop star Katy Perry:


https://www.instagram.com/p/BeXchJzFkhJ/?hl=en

In her post, captioned ‚Äú$‚ÄîCrYpTo ClAwS‚Äî$,‚Äù Ms. Perry documents a handful of, at the time, popular cryptocurrencies. The 5 currencies pictured were: ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin, monero, and stellar lumens. Was this Ms. Perry‚Äôs portfolio at the time? Who‚Äôs to say? What we can determine are the prices, sourced from CMC, on the date of this post, January 25, 2018. The prices were as follows:

ETH: 1060.55

LTC: 180.76

BTC: 11410.30

XMR: 320.54

XLM: 0.567

Source:  https://web.archive.org/web/20180125004005/https://coinmarketcap.com/

As of the time of writing this, the prices are as follows:

ETH: 238.95 (-77.5%)

LTC: 43.51 (-75.9%)

BTC: 9302.45 (-18.4%)

XMR: 64.11 (-80%)

XLM: 0.0695 (-87.7%)

Source:  https://web.archive.org/web/20200706171512/https://www.coinmarketcap.com/

Assuming an equal share in each nail, despite the thumb and therefore ethereum being the superior finger, Ms. Perry‚Äôs portfolio would be down 67.9% since the date of her instagram post. For reference, the market cap is currently down only 30.3% of what it was at the time of her post. 

In conclusion, I would not recommend following Katy Perry‚Äôs investment advice, no matter how sweet her nails may look.

imawfullyaverage,0.0,597.0,"Let me preface this by saying I have made bank off DOGE (bought 925k at \~0.023, check my last post) and that I love the memes and the community.

As you all probably know, DOGE has now hit the mainstream media big-time and is making waves in the financial space, drawing in new faces by the thousands. This is fun and all, but I'm worried it's detrimental to the overall health of the cryptocurrency space, and might also have something to do with the correction we're currently in.

For most of you regulars in here, DOGE is simply a meme that is fun to trade, but for a lot of people, DOGE is a genuine investment. I have already had discussions with several people about the potential price targets for DOGE, where they're trying to make the case for a $100 price target, which even long-term is extremely unlikely. Other people that are new to crypto in facebook groups genuinely ask what we think about DOGE as a long-term investment, like they would for BTC, ETH and other solid projects. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/KYvEOmi)'s an example of someone genuinely believing the technology behind DOGE is ""fantastic"". People are risking their family savings investing in DOGE, not knowing it's likely to dump once the hype staves off. 

Presumably most here would know that DOGE has no maximum supply or halving mechanism, so it'll keep printing coins into infinity, essentially reducing the value of the coins held by hodlers as soon as the demand lowers. It has no inherent value beyond its memes and community, and so for long-time traders seeing that DOGE is still rallying while everything else is dropping, is creating major uncertainty. Additionally, various celebrities are actively tweeting about DOGE, skyrocketing its price, rendering technical analysis completely obsolete. How are you supposed to make good buys if fundamentals and technical analysis no longer matters? 

Also, at this point, [one single hodler currently sits on 28,72% of all DOGE in circulation](https://www.coinexplorer.net/DOGE/richlist). The top 16 bagholders have over 50% of all DOGE. That is an issue. 

Make of this what you will, but for me, I think that this is a major issue that we need to address. I want cryptocurrencies to succeed as they're precisely what we need in the world right now. As opposed to Robinhood, cryptocurrencies *actually* democratize finance, and thus the world, so it's extremely important we do our best to make sure cryptocurrencies are taken seriously.",CryptoCurrency,"Unpopular opinion: DOGE is fun, but is actively delegitimizing the crypto space",597.0,0.84

‚Ä¢	‚Å†take chunks of your profits out of crypto entirely &amp; diversify, you can lockup a small percentage into defi and earn interest as a hedge to offset fomo

‚Ä¢	‚Å†pay your taxes (optional?) and/or save money for a rainy day in fiat

‚Ä¢	‚Å†set some low limit orders you don't think will hit on the way up and be patient

‚Ä¢	‚Å†set some high limit orders on the way down to catch any fat finger trades

‚Ä¢	‚Å†keep a few low orders on exchanges that still allow flash crashes and think of those as your reserves

‚Ä¢	‚Å†don't ever talk to people about your gains

‚Ä¢     specify a strategy prior to the new bull run, including exit points and several levels at which you plan to sell parts of your stack

2) When you do invest, transfer your tokens from the exchange you bought on to your own wallet, and then walk away. Don‚Äôt touch these tokens for at least 6 months, or a year, or however long you think you can last before having the urge to sell.

3) Join the teams Telegram of the company you invested in. Only set notifications on their announcements channel so you can stay up-to-date with their progress. 

4) Only set rising price alerts for the tokens you are invested in and try to only check your portfolio like once a week.

Today I would like to share with you the results of another manipulation investigation that was recently completed on r/CryptoCurrency and r/CryptoMarkets. Most of the time investigations are handled behind the scenes so the culprits do not learn our methods and evade them, but in certain cases like this one I believe it is good to show people what to look out for.  Some background, more resources about digital manipulation, and a prior report can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/d1qneb/crypto_reddit_manipulation_report_dream_network/).

**DISCLAIMER: Visit any of the links below at your own risk.**  Some are NSFW and others are redirects that may send you to an unknown location.  You may want to use a tool like https://wheregoes.com/ to examine redirect chains more safely, though these tools aren't bulletproof either

#The Fun Space Group

The Fun Space group arrived on our radar recently for posting redirect links mainly across r/CryptoMarkets and smaller crypto subs.  This is against Rule 1 in both subs because automod evasion obviously makes moderating harder, but it also sends the user to a destination they don't expect.  This might be done immediately or they might wait for the post to become popular and then sell it to a porn/malware distributor [as seemingly happened here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/e0y94v/segwit_adoption_hits_another_ath_scaling_working/).  There is very little, if any, legitimate use for redirect domains and it is very inorganic behavior.

The typical [MO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi) for these bots is to periodically spam these redirect domains across 5 to 10 subreddits, always with a similar title and using a [TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) like .fun or .space.  Note, this is not limited to crypto, I found several cases where it included gaming, science, and merchandise targeted spam as well.  You'll also see that these redirect posts are always upvoted to somewhere around 40 to 100 points, even though they are low quality and often posted in dead subs, which is clear [vote manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/vote_manipulation)

A quick glance at these accounts might not look fishy because between spam campaigns they always have organic looking comments.  After digging a little deeper I noticed a few things.  These comments were in popular posts I had seen on r/all and they always had a lot of comments.  If you load all comments and ctrl+F ""title are hilarious"" [in this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/lg7gnv/not_very_tall_tale/), you'll see what I found.  3 different accounts placed the exact same comment in that thread.  What these bots are doing to simulate organic activity is finding popular threads on r/all and just copying an existing comment.  Usually they are among of hundreds or thousands of comments, so a human would never notice.

I'm waiting for my ticket üé´. I strongly feel it will come within good time.  Just waiting for my holdings to hit that 10x mark.  I understand not all  my holdings will go that route. After all, I have really heavy bags from 2017.  Especially APPC.   But a few others that have paid off during this boom.  Then I plan to compile them into 1 or 2 then watch that go up 5x more again. 

Nobody should be ashamed to admit that's what they want, and history shows you can get that by simply holding. Although not gaurantreed you specifically will. 

Anyone who held BTC through the gain, and crash and back up to 50K is sitting good.   Anyone who dumped into neo when it was super low last year is doing golden.    Same with many other alts.

UrMuMGaEe,0.0,570.0,"I'm not going to make a big paragraph, just point to point facts.

The Basics :-

Fact 1 : This subreddit is a discussion forum for various CryptoCurrencies.

Fact 2 : This is NOT a PUMP and DUMP subreddit where we encourage users to buy a coin showing various articles and ask them to FOMO in.

Fact 3 : CryptoCurrencies can be traded 24/7 on exchanges, there is no closing or opening, and there are also no entities that can HALT trading and prevent you from buying/selling.

Fact 4 : There is a lot of volatility in crypto relative to normal stocks. This is an emerging concept and get in only if you can LOSE your money in a SINGLE DAY!

Fact 4 : There is also a lot of misinformation on all social media in regards to Crypto. Assume every single person explaining why a coin is better is a SHILLER, AKA he wants you and all the people he talks to buy his favourite coin so that price can increase.

Fact 5 : Don't trust even a veteran investor or any other person showing fancy graphs saying that certain coin will go up or down. Especially twitter is full of these people, don't even trust the verified twitter accounts.

Fact 6 : DO NOT BUY THESE GIVEAWAYS, no one gives you crypto if you send them some amount, IF you send it, it is GONE! Can't come back!

Fact 7 : The DOGECOIN growth is now a PUMP! so remember, all the PUMPS follow a DUMP! I had a experience and I don't want this for others. Same was the case for XRP Ripple coin in 2017 and it is now running lawsuits to lawsuits.

Fact 8 : CryptoCurrencies are NOT ILLEGAL! If you see warren buffet say what is bitcoin and we can't even see it, it isn't worth a dime, ask yourself, why is this man saying so? these people are the old ones who believe and live on DOLLARS! Crypto is harmful for their personal gains.

Fact 9 : Crypto is NOT a GET RICH FAST scheme. And it is also never too late to get in or also get out!

Fact 10 : DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. A healthy Skepticism is what saves you in whatever situation you are! Imagine this, we all literally see the IMDB and RT ratings for a movie to watch it or not which can be watched at our whim via online streaming, then why shouldn't you READ the OFFICIAL WHITEPAPER and roadmap for a certain crypto?

Okay basics done, now I assume you want to get into crypto.

The intermediate stuff:

Fact 1 : When you buy CryptoCurrency from an exchange, YOU DON'T OWN THE CRYPTO. It is just the exchange saying that you have bought it. If the exchange  gets hacked, YOU LOSE ALL OF IT.

Fact 2 : So, what to do? This is where WALLETS come in! You have to transfer your crypto from the exchange to your wallet. Every wallet has a private and public key and a backup phrase. The wallet Address is used as an ""Address"" i.e it is used to RECEIVE Crypto. If you want to withdraw your crypto from exchange or ask someone to send some crypto to you, you give them the WALLET ADDRESS.

Fact 3 : Save your wallet backup phrase in case you lose the wallet. NEVER GIVE BACKUP PHRASE OR YOUR PRIVATE KEY TO SOMEONE. And for god's sake WRITE DOWN THE BACKUP PHRASE on a paper. Don't take a screenshot and throw it away in the depths of gallery waiting for your phone to be reset someday.

Fact 4 : Wallets can be classified based on 2 things. Based on who holds them : Custodial and non-custodial. Custodial means that you DON'T OWN THE WALLET and the wallet just merely gives you a way to interact with your crypto. Non custodial means that YOU ARE THE SOLE OWNER of that wallet and it is safer and also better to the cause of Crypto. Based on HARDWARE/SOFTWARE : As you guessed, software wallets are wallets that exist on your digital devices, phones are better than computers. Although these are better than holding in exchanges, Hardware wallets are even better. Hardware wallets are like the literal non-crackable personal SAFES you can BUY for around 50/60$.

Fact 5 : Alright, wallets aside. Exchanges/your wallets have something called a transaction fee. This is used to perform your transaction and SEND your crypto to its destination.

Fact 6 : Every coin/token has a UTILITY. See what it is and if you believe it can fulfil its purpose and also has the team/developers to take it forward, only then invest. For example ETH Ethereum was created to enable people to build Apps on it like a universal open source computer. And DOGECOIN is A MEME, the creator of DOGECOIN himself says it.

Fact 7 : There is a long way to go and it will definitely be full of roadblocks and gains and losses. A single man tweeting bitcoin makes it go up and a news that someone sold big chuck of bitcoin makes it go down. Learn to have DIAMOND HANDS and hold!

Fact 8 :  Although the mods here do their very best 24/7 to maintain a healthy environment here, there is no shortage of people commenting their coin will rise. Become immune to this. Daily articles are posted and also some success stories saying how BTC helped them buy lambos and stuff. This is survivor bias. No one will come over and say ""Hey I lost money buying crypto"", human mentality itself is hardwired to share successes not failures.

Fact 9 : Never ever take ADVICE from the INTERNET. Would you ever ask your neighbour where to put your 1000$? In the same way, if you ever ask someone what to buy, they will most prolly say to buy their coin.

Fact 10 : INVEST ONLY WHAT YOU CAN LOSE. Learn what is Dollar Cost Averaging. Don't try to time the market and buy at lows and sell at highs. No one can predict these markets. Have an exit strategy for yourself. For example, I invest 300$ every month and no matter if it is an all time low or all time high. And I intend to pull a big chuck out if my BTC ever reaches to a level where I can afford higher education. Don't have a NUMBER decide your exit time, have a requirement/some personal threshold to pull out.

And..,

1 : What you see with the whole GME and short squeeze is literally an endorsement for crypto.

2 : The game has been long rigged by Wall Street guys and crypto is ""Intended"" to remove these acts of rich people ruling over retail guys.

3 : Crypto is to fiat/normal stock as how the ""Diners Club Card"" was back then. They said it was just a plastic card, it isn't money. Now look all round you, credit debit and cashless payments are UNAVOIDABLE. Generally speaking, when there is new concept or revolution, there are the early adopters, the denying people and maximalists. This is also a revolution, Warren Buffet said ""Bitcoin is RAT Poison"", well now it is worth more than his own company's market cap. This is a revolution.

4 : And if you are from r/wallstreetbets , Welcome Aboard! What you guys have done is literally what is the aim of crypto! ""These whole series of events are bullish for Crypto"" ..now did you believe what I said,?  NO lol, that was listed in basics, DYOR! However a statement may seem correct, check it yourself!

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, welcome to Crypto and a new era of economy of the people, by the people and for the people. Crypto is an attempt to make sure that, ""The deserving win over the Privileged"" in this game.

And have fun, weekends are meme days and we post memes too!

To be able to comprehend staking, you first need to know about Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work. Here is a quick summary.

* **‚õè Proof-of-Work** (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used to decide which blockchain network users are eligible to create a new block. For an entity to be selected and able to choose the next block, they‚Äôll have to solve a particular mathematical problem.
* **üíº Proof-of-Stake** (PoS) is another consensus mechanism to determine which users get to create new blocks on the blockchain. With this method, you don‚Äôt need to solve a mathematical problem, and thus, you‚Äôll need less computing power and energy. New block creators are selected by the amount of wealth they‚Äôve locked-up in the network.

An often asked question is if PoS is more secure then PoW. Even though every blockchain network is different and has its level of risk, a common chance with a blockchain is the 51% attack; this poses a hypothetical situation in which miners with more than 50% of the computational power of PoW blockchains would permanently own the blockchain. And thus be able to change transactions and have the possibility to double-spend cryptocurrencies. Now, that‚Äôs not something anyone would want to happen since this destroys the fundamentals of the blockchain.

For PoW systems, for such an attack to occur, miners would need to have more than 50% of computational power (and a lot of hardware), so we could say that this is almost impossible. For a 51% attack to happen on PoS systems, someone would need to own over 50% of all available tokens. With most systems having large market capitalizations in the millions of dollars, we could also say that this is near to impossible. Furthermore, buying assets from a network inflates the price of the token. If you‚Äôd to try and buy half a network worth of symbols, it would eventually just become too expensive. Plus, once you‚Äôd own most of the network, you don‚Äôt have the interest to attack it since your ownership would lose value as well. And so, in this aspect, PoS could be considered more secure.

&amp;#x200B;

# Benefits of Staking

So, why would you stake your crypto assets? Staking cryptocurrencies offers several advantages. First, staking your assets through PoS avoids being diluted by inflation. Nonetheless, the value of your staked tokens can be affected by fluctuations in the currency price.

Furthermore, a significant benefit of staking digital assets is that it doesn‚Äôt require expensive hardware, which makes it more accessible to a broad public. Thirdly, staking offers a quasi-guaranteed return and a predictable source of income when measured in tokens. Also, it is more environmentally friendly to invest in PoS because it doesn‚Äôt require high amounts of energy, like with mining in PoW networks.

&amp;#x200B;

# Risks of Staking

As with any investment, staking cryptocurrencies isn‚Äôt risk-free. So, let‚Äôs go over the risks involved.

First, there is the possibility of Slashing; this means your validator or baker can receive punishment for a fault conducted. This mechanism is designed to discourage abnormal behavior. The second, and probably most crucial risk, is crypto volatility, which means that some cryptocurrencies exposed to rapid and unexpected change. If it‚Äôs for the better, these changes can be helpful and very profitable. However, the downside is that it can depreciate the price of your tokens too much, leaving you empty-handed.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

There are many reasons why it would be attractive to start staking cryptocurrencies. However, before you get started, do your research. It will guarantee that you find the right currencies, wallet, and operator for your needs. Always search for 3rd parties and reviews when researching a cryptocurrency or operator.

Uniswap is currently by far the largest contributor to ETH congestion and high fees (making up about 30% of fees alone on ETH) 

Once Uniswap, Sushiswap, Compound and these other major Dapps implement L2 all the congestion is going to come off of Ethereum which means transaction volume is going to shoot through the ROOF but will be done so for pennies.

This is the most bullish news to the ETH space but you will not hear it emphasized because of all the FUD going around saying eTh CaNt ScALE.

With EIP 1559 also coming this summer allowing for more ""predictable"" fees therefore saving average users gas fees along with L2, Ethereum is going to experience SIGNIFICANT growth in the coming months.

Some people here think the world owes them guaranteed profits. You have invested in a project you believe will reward you with something bigger in return, yet you lose your cool every time you see red or it has been a *‚Äústablecoin‚Äù* lately. I think this bunch of people either bought when lumens was at .40-60.

I believe that the people who have the largest holdings don‚Äôt even moan about this price. They have a strategy instead. They don‚Äôt constantly check the price and complain about how XLM is dipping or not pumping up hard lately. They are probably buying this dip more, or they have cashed out their initial investments and let the profits ride. They are probably more interested in learning what Stellar does to check if its mission is still being actively developed and upheld by SDF, so they‚Äôll have the assurance albeit **not guaranteed** that they have put their money in the right project. They are probably the most patient ones cause they are secured by the fact that Stellar has gained more adoptions, and it has been around since 2014. It has survived the harsh crypto winter by developing more projects.

Cryptos have definitely caused a lot of ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù (might as well say speculators) to have short-term memories and expect numbers to go up instantly. When they don‚Äôt, they think the coin is a shitcoin and jump into another one.

It is funny how we even call it cryptocurrencies when people don‚Äôt treat them as currencies but assets.

I get that it is highly frustrating knowing how XLM still hasn‚Äôt reached its ATH while some coins did. What this just shows me is that the market is irrational.

Consider Doge, a memecoin but went parabolic; XRP with Ripple being sued for selling XRP for profit yet it is still soaring; CAKE and BAKE which rose to a high price because of the DeFi hype; ADA with no real projects built yet but future speculations; ETH with congested network and high gas fees; and BTC which has failed to become a digital P2P currency and is now branded as a store of value.

If we talk about fundamentals, Algorand (I don‚Äôt hold any) and Stellar are at the forefront. The Marshall Islands used Algorand to issue their national digital currency called SOV. LTO has also gained partnerships with UN and the Netherlands Government.

We can say as well that Ethereum is at the forefront(heck even Bitcoin as it has the institutional backing), but until now it hasn‚Äôt fixed its scalability issues and the high gas fees. Sure, Layer2 exists like Loopring but majority of people still use Layer1 and using Layer2 solutions is actually not user-friendly. If Cardano can indeed deliver, then I don‚Äôt think Ethereum will be the main player in the long run.

If you look at CoinMarketCap though, most of the projects in cryptocurrency space are either a knock-off of Ethereum or trying to be the next Ethereum.

You have Binance launching its own DEX and taking opportunity of the crazy yield farming hype. You also have ATOM launching its own interconnected blockchain which sounds really cool, and you earn some sweet stakes at 10% APY, but the question that always crosses my mind is this: *what important problems are they trying to solve, and have they really solved at least one thing?*

Because all I see when it comes to these projects are: GREED. GAINS. SHORT-TERM. *HYPE.*

You can even earn 30% APY on some. How sustainable is this?

**It‚Äôs clear. The market is irrational.**

When all this hype goes down, I hope projects tackling important problems like Stellar will rise up, and maybe just maybe, XLM will be valued fairly.

**We know that XLM is undervalued.** We know that many traders use it as their bridge currency for exchanging their cryptos or moving coins between exchanges. We and they know that XLM has a great potential.
Just a day ago, a leading mobile operator in Turkey, Paycell, announced support for buying and selling of cryptos and guess what? [XLM is supported again next to ETH and BTC.](https://www.coinkolik.com/turkcellin-paycell-uygulamasi-ile-artik-kripto-para-alim-satimi-yapilabilecek/)

*[Buying rums in Bermuda with a digital dollar issued on Stellar](https://www.coindesk.com/bermuda-to-pilot-digital-dollar-for-rum-sales)

*[Getting cashback rewards](https://paymynt.money/#blockchain)*

*Have you also heard that you can send absolutely send remittances now to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Tanzania, South Africa, and Nigeria using Stellar?* You can. Just use a Stellar wallet like Lobstr.

*What about creating NFT on Stellar without paying huge fees? You just need 2 XLM at most.*

*Do you even know that Stellar has an in-built DEX? Right. What does that mean? Well, if you download or use any Stellar Wallet, you can do P2P trades (buy, sell, or swap) for a fraction of a cent. In a simple word? You have instant access to a decentralized exchange. Stellar is a payment and a DEX platform at the same time.

The most famous Stellar tokens gaining traction? Well, Smartlands (SLT) with 7 million total supply tokenizing assets like real estate and agriculture and has a fee-pool incentive of 33% going to SLT holders holding ‚Ç¨1000 of SLT as well as AKON which is being adopted in Africa.

As you can see, the tokens listed on Stellar are actually solving different purposes. They are not just a knock-off of Uniswap.

Listen. All major exchanges have stellar lumens (XLM) too. Another news? Coinbase will be launching their own debit card with 4% XLM cashback.

Lumens can be moved easily fast and cheap. It fits the most crypto of crypto as a currency.

Stellar is not all about hype and future speculations. They have the products working already. I believe if we value XLM based on fundamentals? It is easily a top 3 coin.

Its founder Jed McCaleb is also not a shiller. Some might say Stellar should up their marketing game, and they are working on that now. But I appreciate Jed for not being like the rest of the founders and devs who participate in Twitter shilling.

It‚Äôs clear. You can‚Äôt really call it a *failing crypto* or mock it as a *stablecoin.* I‚Äôll wait till this underdog rises up. If I lose money, so be it. I have principles even in investing: I only invest in projects that solve important problems and do the work diligently without building so much hype than putting my money in projects fueled with hype but can‚Äôt offer anything tangible on the table.

I will not be providing any advice on what to buy, sell, or hodl in this post but rather exposing the differences between these TYPES of projects and why they do not compete with one another or how they do. These explanations are not super in-depth but I know that many aren't taking the time to actually read the documentation from these projects and hopefully some of this will help give our community a better understanding.

#  Smart Contract Blockchain Platform

## Ethereum (ETH):
Ethereum was the first of it's kind, at least, the first to successfully make a large blockchain platform that successfully deploys and runs smart contracts while also handling millions of transactions a day. (Running a smart contract is also considered a transaction.  As of today, Ethereum has managed to put out 1.303 million transactions and there are over 3000 decentralized applications (dApps, https://www.stateofthedapps.com/platforms/ethereum)


With those transactions in mind, Ethereum has an issue on its hands and you can guess it. Gas. Gas is the method for which the entire blockchain runs. Imagine your car, you need gas to crank it and drive it. Same thing you need gas to send transactions. Why is this? This is due to to the Proof of Work protocol that allows for these transactions to be done. I won't go into the nitty gritty. But basically, you're paying the miners to process your transaction.

## Cardano (ADA):
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform on their blockchain technology. Supposedly it will be more feature-rich than Ethereum. However, the biggest difference between Cardano and Ethereum is that Cardano utilizes a newer concept known as Proof of Stake. Proof of stake basically has members who hold a specific token the ability to stake their tokens into a stake pool so that the representing server of that pool may process transactions and earn rewards. Those rewards are then dispersed to the members staking their funds. (Expecting personal attacks for mentioning this name, but this is how the Tron (TRX) network runs).

Literally not much else to be said at this point, until Cardano releases Smart Contracts and their documentation and mission proves friendly enough for developers. We can't speculate whether it's a better platform than Ethereum. 

With ETH 2.0 expecting to come out next year, there will not be much difference between these two except for how their governance works and how their Proof-of-Stake works. With this in mind, what matters is the community between these two and which platform provides better documentation for the community and big organizations to be able to developer their own decentralized applications on.



# Internet of Blockchains

## Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot's main goal is to utilize a relay chain to coordinate the system and the Parachains. Parachains are the platforms which will be built by other development teams to create their own blockchains ON the DOT platform. For example, if Ethereum were in the development stages of OG Ethereum, then they may have considered developing Ethereum on DOT  so that some features were already handled (such as security and communications between other blockchains.) 

You can not run a Smart Contract on DOT's network. The relay chain was deliberately minimized in functionality so that it could focus on the main components of DOT. However, there are Ethereum competitors known as Ink!, Moonbeam, and Edgeware that will be coming out on the DOT platform as Smart Contract Parachains (blockchains.)

Validators are basically servers producing blocks on the Relay chain and they receive staking rewards for producing them.

Collators are nodes on both a Parachain and a relay chain, they collect transactions and produce state transition proofs for the validators to accept. Also are the method of communication between blockchains through XCMP (cross-chain message passing)


##  Cosmos (ATOM)

Cosmos main focus is Internet of Blockchains but is a tad different in how they want to interact with these blockchains compared to DOT. Seems more like ATOM wants to compete with Smart Contracts by allowing Application-Specific Blockchains. It looks like they are trying to attempt this by allowing developers to develop a blockchain that is customized to operate a single dApp. I don't fully understand how they plan to do this. I'll come back and edit this section in the morning.


The main goal of Cosmos however is still to allow developers to create blockchains on top of Tendermint (cosmos default consensus engine) so that they can interoperate with one another. The main difference between DOT and ATOM is that DOT will be more specific about how you can create your blockchain in order for it to operate on the DOT network. ATOM has more freedom for the developer.


I'm always welcome to criticism.

Some people misinterpreted my poorly worded mention of TRX to mean that the network of ADA through PoS would cause more network attacks. I really meant that I expected the sub to blast me for mentioning Trons name

DDelphinus,0.0,523.0,"I've started to realize that my 2017 bags are impacting my research into 'new' coins. I've become emotionally invested and spend most my time reading articles on coins that I already have, rather than ones that I should read about.

In my mind, NEO is still the main competitor for Ethereum and Dash the main challenger for Bitcoin.

As a result, I've missed out on great opportunities like ADA, DOT and BNB since they didn't fit my own narrative.

Just wanted to share and give my new found advice:

Their community seems so much tighter than ours, and I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder why?  

Why does it seem so fractured here? They all have their favourite stocks like we do our coins and tokens. They are trying to make money like many here.

whyubreak,0.0,523.0,"I was holding some old tokens from around 3 years ago that I bought in an ICO, looked on CMC to find what exchanges were trading it and only HitBTC was. So I signed up, seeing that their withdrawal limits for unverified accounts were over the amount that I was trading (around $5,000 worth of coins).

Deposited my tokens, sold them for ETH, went to withdraw. It randomly says ""failed"" after about 3 hours, with no email notification or explanation. So I tried to withdraw again, then it says that my account has been disabled.

I've emailed support, still no response after nearly a week even though their support page says responses happen within 24 hrs. Went over to their subreddit and see that they've been scamming people like this for a LONGGG time now. Some people have been trying to get their money for over a year.

Why is this shitty exchange still listed on coinmarketcap?
