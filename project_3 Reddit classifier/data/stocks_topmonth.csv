electricp0ww0w,0.0,19990.0,"Forget the balance sheets, the financials , the ceo, the board etc. Before I do *any* of this, I tap the head office address of the company into Google and look at it on streetview.

It might sound simple, but bear with me...

If you get chance to watch The China Hustle on Netflix, do it. It's about how Chinese companies performed security fraud to get listed on the NYSE/DAQ with nothing but lies about how big, good and profitable they were. Basically, they said they were billion dollar companies. Nobody from the SEC or the US bothered to check and took their word for it.

The documentary spoke to a short seller who uncovered the fraud. The very first alarm bell was when he looked at the road leading up to a paper plant that claimed it was running thousands of tonnes of high quality paper in and out daily. The road leading up to the site was a crappy dirt track road that could no way, take the number of trucks the company said they were running.

Now, they physically went out to check the site, but theres a lot from Google Street View you can learn. I find this more so with chinese companies.

As an example, I looked at a chinese company earlier that had a market cap of around 3 billion. Don't ask me what, i've checked so many today &gt;_&gt;

Anyway, their head office, as listed on their website and SEC filings was nothing more than a shop in a line of other shops. It looked total garbage. I nope'd out straight away. The one thing I learned from the documentary, even more so about Chinese companies, is they present to the SEC/Banks whatever they want, and *NOBODY* checks it. They are 'auditors', as in they 'audit' what is presented. They are not physically checking if a company is trash or not. That's your job i'm afraid. Nobody will protect you, especially the banks or brokers, because they take your money.

Now, bear in mind this might not be flawless, as companies might have holding adresses or something, but I find most of the time it's all good.

This just doesnt apply to China. Check Europe or the US. Is the company that is ""growing, expanding and breaking out"" still running its office out of some fucking ghetto with some cops in the background of streetview clearing up some bodies? Or do they have plush offices in an affluent area which probably cost a small fortune to upkeep. 

This is by no means flawless, but if you wanted to buy a house, you'd want to look at it first. Same for a car. You wouldnt just read the stats/dimensions on paper. Why should stonk be any different?

I think streetview is a very under valued tool when it comes to doing some DD and can give you a fairly good impression of if what they present on paper could be mirrored with what they present in real life.

-----------------------------------------------------

***Edit - I just wanna clear a few things up here since this kinda exploded.***

Firstly, I'm NOT saying ""oNly iNvEsT iN bIg CoRpOrAtE oFfICeS"" which is what some people think I'm saying. Doing DD is a full process. It's a jigsaw, and what i'm suggesting here is one piece of that Jigsaw. Yes, companies sometimes have a mailing address. Yes sometimes companies use multiple adresses. This is what DD is about. Why are they using multiple adresses? Go and look into SEC filings and research those adresses. Is it because they are being dishonest, or is there a legit reason for it?

Secondly, it appears the documentary i referenced isnt open on Netflix to US users. Some people here have suggested Amazon or Hulu.

Thirdly, yes Google Maps only covers a small region in china. Use map.baidu.com - It's all in chinese but the format is the same and its easy to figure out. Be aware, it's slow and laggy but better than nothing. Also be aware, that there have been reports of the Chinese government censoring some buildings out of the views. I doubt this will cause a big issue if you're looking at small/medium cap companies but just in case... Something to bear in mind. 

Forthly, people saying ""iF U nEeD tO Do Dis tHe CoMpANy iS obvS TrAsH"". *Christ*. If you think i'm telling you to go and google the Facebook or Berkshire headquarters, then you're wrong. I'm talking about DD on stocks you are looking at investing in. Check out all the top movers today on Finviz. I gurantee that you would have heard of a couple of them at most. I'm talking about people who want to invest in a stock that they hope is going to make big returns, not someone who is content with earning 2% every 3 months on Apple or Amazon. 

Fifth, goddam i'm gonna repeat the first point again. I'm not saying this is the basis for solid DD. Yeah, Amazon started selling books from a garage, i get it. What i'm saying is to help you build a bigger picture of your entire DD before you plump your hard earned money into something. You need all the facts. You wouldn't buy a house and look in great detail at every room except one. You wouldnt buy a car and study the detailed pictures and 0-60 times without having a look at the miles per gallon (euro scrub here, we pay 70% tax on fuel so it matters). If you're dead set on a company but on Google it looks like its run from a shed, then you might still be happy with this. If you're 50/50 about a stock, it might tip the balance for you one way or the other.

And 6th, I shouldnt really need to address this because I thought everyone knew it, but yes - some map data is old. Check the date on the map data. If its very old, try the Sat image because it might be newer. I thought we all knew this... We all check our own houses out every few months to see if there's an update, right?

I cant stress enough, this is *one tool* to use while making your entire DD picture. It'll work for some, it won't work for others. If someone has a tactic that makes all DD work perfectly all of the time, then give Buffet a call and get off Reddit.

Love you all x

onlymadethistoupvote,0.0,19511.0,"International brokers sued over naked short selling allegations
CIBC, Bank of America, UBS and TD Bank stand accused of coordinating “abusive” naked short selling and spoofing strategies in US and Canadian stock markets by a Bermuda hedge fund that claims to have lost tens of millions of dollars as a result.

Harrington Global Opportunity Fund has filed a suit at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that various US and Canadian financial institutions, through their broker divisions, manipulated markets and drove down pharmaceutical company ADVANZ PHARMA’s (formerly Concordia) share price in 2016.

The specialist pharmaceutical recapitalised and rebranded in 2018 after being embroiled in a long-running dispute over apparent price hikes and accusations of mismanagement by its founder and CEO Mark Thompson, who stepped down in 2016. 

According to the suit, the defendants, which include several unnamed US and Canadian individuals, allegedly flooded the market with false sell signals by simultaneous naked short selling — in which the trader does not borrow a stock, or determine that it can be borrowed, before they short sell — and spoofing — a form of high-frequency trading that artificially inflates perceived demand of a security — which created millions of ‘phantom’ shares.

These practices violate the US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and Regulation SHO. 

The result, Harrington suggests, is that Concordia’s stock price tumbled from $34.77 to $1.83 over 11 months.

According to the complaint, Harrington sold 9 million Concordia shares on US and Canadian markets, including the NASDAQ and the Toronto Stock Exchange, in response to the defendants’ alleged illegal market manipulation.

Harrington is seeking damages, legal fees and interest. 

It is alleged that in 2016 there were approximately 238 million shares of Concordia stock that were sold short on the Canadian and US exchanges, constituting around 58 per cent of the approximately 410 million Concordia shares traded during the period in question. 

However, Harrington argues that only 40 million shares were actually issued for trading, meaning the short sale turnover rate was approximately 600 per cent.

“The enormous discrepancy between the 40 million shares issued by Concordia for trading and the approximately 410 million Concordia shares traded during this period represents an astonishingly high turnover rate of 1,000 per cent,” the suit states. 

The fund alleges that a “strong inference can be drawn” that these figures were inflated by “millions of fictitious shares unlawfully manufactured” through naked short selling.

Lawyers for the plaintiff told SFT that no court date has been set.

None of the financial institutions featured in the complaint wished to provide a comment for this story.

poison_ivey,0.0,14991.0,"A colleague just started trading.  I recommended a strong stock I’ve done good DD on but cautioned it will take awhile to see any gains.

A few weeks later it increased 20% on some good news and then dropped 5% for net 15%.  He’s texting me days later “wtf poison_ivey this stock blows, when is it going to take off??”

With all the recent hype some people are looking for X00% overnight and expect massive gains with no effort.  It’s also really hard to sell when something you own is on a crazy run and FOMO creeps in.

The key success here is don’t get greedy.   Take your profits and protect your capital core.  Every stock is different and nothing is ever a sure bet.  Lululemon used to be a really strong buy but took a huge dip a few years back because of allegations against the founder

My average annual return is 20%.  It’s not as sexy as making infinite gains on shorts but it means I will retire a lot sooner than I thought I ever could.  If one of my tickers hits bigger than I thought I reassess value and often I take my book value and use the gravy to ride that train the rest of the way

If you could afford to invest $1k per year you could retire w over a million, and way more if you can increase your annual investment more each year.

Compound interest at a rate of return of 20% after
20 years = $275k ($20k invested @ $1k per year.
25 years = $775k ($25k invested @$1k per year).
30 years = $1.3M ($30k invested @$1k per year).

After 30 years you could retire and earn an annual income of $78k with a passive 6% interest without eroding that core $1.3M.

Start small and be patient.  Decide what percentage of your capital you are willing to go YOLO on and what amount you need to protect to avoid that “holy crap what have I done I’ve lost everything and I’m going to vomit” feeling.

Edit:  I’ve been investing 7 years.  So as many have commented that isn’t long enough to have seen a huge dip and I agree.  I don’t want to mislead.

The point of this post was not to say 20% forever is easy or hard or that everyone should expect that.  The point is to protect your capital and take small risks to learn and build.

Figure out how much pre-tax $$ you need to live every year and divide that by 5%.  That’s what you need to retire.

presidentgertler,0.0,12326.0,"For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my ""fun"" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. 

By this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). 

Then came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. **All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month.** I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. 

I'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.

**How does it work:**  The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Week on Week increase in mentions: **73%**

Month on Month increase in mentions: **247%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

Corsair is the leading manufacturer of high-performance gear and technology for games and PC enthusiasts. Another important part of their portfolio is the brand Elgato which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, competitive gamers, and streamers. Currently, their products are in high demand and command a significant price premium against other brands.

**Financials**

Corsair currently has a net revenue of $1.7B (55% increase YoY) and a gross profit of 456MM (107% increase YoY). They had 84% increase in the sales of gamer and creator peripherals. Net income is 103MM compared to 8.4MM loss last year.

They had a gross margin improvement of 6.9% (lesser availability of parts allowed them to jack up their margins) and paid off $190MM debt in 2020. (Current debt of $321MM with $133MM cash in hand)

**Potential and Hype Factor**

People are increasingly spending more and more time on video games and Corsair caters to the premium segment in this market. Adding to this, the current explosion in Twitch viewership and Corsair’s marketing strategy of sponsoring famous streamers to showcase their premium gear further adds to the product demand.

The company is also benefitting greatly from the changing landscape due to the ongoing Covid crisis. As more and more people stay home and abstain from their regular hobbies, they have turned to digital entertainment with PC gaming being one of the leading contenders.  In fact, video game consumption is currently at an all-time high and is set to explode even further.

**Risk and Competition**

I see 3 major risk factors for Corsair

a. Supply Constraints: They currently have unmet demand due to supply constraints which benefitted their margins. But a more severe supply constraint can negatively affect their revenue and brand image

b. Return to normal: The current growth rate might not be sustainable once the pandemic is over and people can return to their regular lifestyle

c. One firm owns 80% of the outstanding shares: Corsair is majorly controlled by EagleTree Capital which has majority voting power and an 80% ownership of the company

**Conclusion**

Corsair currently has about 20% market share for gaming peripherals and 40% market share for PC components putting them in an ideal situation to capture any future growth. Although there is some risk in terms of supply constraints and return to normal, their brand, product line, and current financials are put them in a very strong position.

If you look at the $60 call options, 23k were purchased and assuming that the delta on that was .5, that’s another 1.15 million shares that were purchased to hedge. 

Another 17-18k options were purchased between $51-$59, which means around another million shares were purchased during the run up. 

This is entirely assuming that delta on those were .5. If the Delta was higher = more shares were bought.

**Has the Squeeze Been Sqoze? Absolutely not**

**Will the squeeze be sqoze? Potentially** 

**Strap in. This is going to be exhaustively long, but I have a lot to say.**

**Please** see my other work. I'm not here to convince anyone of anything. I am not a shill, I am not here for confirmation bias, I am a pragmatic, neutral party. Anyone who calls me a shill in the comments certainly cannot read and did not do their proper DD on **me.** If you read my previous works dating back 3 months ago you will see how terrifyingly accurate I have been thus far. Even in Part 5 I nearly perfectly predicted all of Friday's entire movements. 

**Note:** That does not mean I will remain accurate for the entire duration of this saga. I also am not saying all of this to flex, it's because I am tired of being called a shill when I was the original predictors of this squeeze and have since provided logical thought that has been proven accurate. This doesn't mean you should take what I am saying as truth, but it does mean that if it doesn't align with your thoughts you should probably put down the kool-aid, loosen up the tin-foil hat, and listen to someone else's opinion so you can make the best decisions for yourself.

I am not a financial advisor, in fact, this isn't even advice. It is simply my analysis of the situation as it has always been. One thing you will find different with my work than others is my research is changing as the landscape changes. If people are still screaming about the original tactic and not acknowledging the new landscape we are in, please be very cautious of making financial decisions based on what these people have to say. 

**I also want to make it crystal clear that I think the squeeze has not been sqoze, however, the landscape is very different now.**

Finally, any PT’s including support and resistance are beyond difficult to predict. Please do not take these as certain numbers. It’s the guess right now and that very well could change as soon as the market opens Monday.

# So What Happened Friday?

For the sake of this not being an entire novel, I encourage you to read Part 5 as I think that prediction is precisely what happened. To summarize, we saw a bulltrap open us up in the morning and we ran to  the 135 resistant point, volume wasn't enough and we tested in twice before people realized we would not be able to break through, that's when selling and more shorting occurred. The price dipped down to around 88. Now, I didn't mention this in the DD but I did mention it in the comments section that I expect interesting price action around 2pm. Why? Because of the call options expiring ITM. 

I think these shares were already covered. I know we expect a higher price increase, but why? Where is the math to back that the price should go higher during these covering sessions? 

Total Options That Expired On 02/26 ITM: **22,713** [Data from here](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows)

This would equate to **2,271,300** shares 

At **13:02** the price fell to **\~86,** this was the bottom before the upswing at the end of the day. By **13:07** there was a volume of over **20,000,000** in the buying direction. 

Not 5 minutes after we found the bottom for the day there was nearly 9x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered. 

At **13:07** alone there was a positive net change in volume of **17,656,000** nearly 8x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered...within 1 minute. 

The rest of the day continued to uptrend where we saw the price rise back to **\~121**. Then it began falling off again, as did volume. 

Now, ask yourself...why would this be the case? Because none of the price increase at the end of the day was organic purchasing, this was the ITM calls being covered. 

*At this point I'm sure you're ready to stop reading and call me a shill, but I encourage you to carry on so we may understand what comes next. This may not fit your narrative, and that's ok. A squeeze is possible, it might just be time to think that it won't be happening quite the way you imagined.*

# Before we move on to what comes next, let's play with a few more numbers and talk about this idea of holding. 

For some reason, people still believe that holding your shares is preventing HF's from covering. I cannot express how untrue this sentiment is. Holding is a valid play, but it absolutely **should not** be an attempt from keeping your shares from being bought by shorts. A 5 second look at any chart could show you there is **more than enough** sell volume for shorts to get their shares elsewhere if you are not willing to part with them.

Let's take the largest post on r/gme as an example.

The top post of all time received **59,600** upvotes. According to the comments most people are actually holding only about 1-10 shares each. But for the sake of the argument let's get ridiculous and say every one of those upvotes has someone who owns **100** shares of GME. Let's also assume every single one of these shares have been restricted from being borrowed to really screw these guys.

That's a total of **5,960,000** shares that are being tucked away so HF's can't get their grubby little paws on them. On Friday alone, **91,960,000** shares were exchanged. So even in the most ridiculous of circumstances there were plenty of other sellers for shorts to purchase their shares back from. 

Holding is certainly a valid play, but there are two things holding certainly does not do:

1. It does not increase the price of a stock
2. It does not prevent HF's from covering

If you are holding solely because of these two reasons, then you are playing this wrong. There are three reasons to actually hold:

1. You absolutely do not want to sell at a loss and you believe the short squeeze is imminent, so you are patiently waiting for it to occur.
2. You are already positioned extremely well like DFV who has a cost basis of 26.7896
3. You are long on the company and the squeeze is just icing on the cake, you can shut off your computer for a year with no concern and come back to know that you are profitable. 

**If you don't believe me, then please examine the evidence.**

When you purchase a stock the price goes up, when you sell a stock the price goes down. So what happened when RH restricted trading? The price plummeted. Why? Because holding and selling were the only options.

Let's play another absurd game and pretend that 100% of shareholders held when trading was restricted. The price would have gone completely sideways, it would not have gone up or down.

But let's be realistic, that will never happen. Even if retail traders decided to hold, institutions certainly are not running around screaming that they are diamond handed apes who would rather go bankrupt before giving their shares up. No, no. They are going to take their profits and they will do so at your expense. You call them allies which they are not, they are here for profits as we all are and they will gladly sell with 100% gains while everyone else is waiting for 10,000% gains.

I want to pause for a moment in this DD and take a moment to point something out. Even though I'm not trying to convince anyone to sell, I have been called all sorts of names as though I'm evil for offering my opinion and analysis of the situation. But let's be absolutely clear. **You are the ones peer pressuring people into holding. You are the ones trying to convince people of your narrative. You are the ones who will be responsible when someone takes their life if this does not go the way you hope.** 

If you have made it this far, congratulations, I would love to have a discussion regarding the ""hold"" play and how people could argue this is a viable tactic for any of the reasons not outlined above. 

# My Thesis

My thesis remains the same, **the shorts want a short squeeze.** Yes, this sounds absolutely absurd but they are already making a fortune off of this. They need to as most of them lost a lot of money on the first round. They are reporting their losses publicly...but they have not disclosed their gains. 

I think they are intentionally opening unfavorable short positions in order to trigger a squeeze. They open and immediately begin to cover creating the much needed buying pressure that triggers FOMO and market purchasing as well. This allows the price to soar and they absolutely do not intervene. 

Once it reaches a massive sell wall or what they think is the peak, they begin shorting on the way down, opening new, extremely favorable positions. The gains from these new positions offset their losses from the unfavorable ones...by a lot. 

Institutional traders are not stupid, they see this is happening and also capitalize on it adding to the buying pressure at the beginning of a squeeze. They ride it up and they are part of the massive sell walls. As I mentioned before they are more than happy with their 100% gains in a day and have no intent on diamond handing this into the Earth. 

So institutions ride it up, sell at the top, where shorts begin opening new positions on the way back down. They then short just enough positions at the bottom so that this could be triggered yet again. Rinse and repeat.

I think the idea of the [Interstellar Yo-Yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/) was very close to being accurate except it was missing one key component, ""Snidely"" in the story is *intentionally* doing this. 

A circumstance like GME will never happen again, when this is all over there will be new regulations in place that don't allow these kinds of things to happen. Institutions and HF's would be out of their mind to not profit on this for as long as they can.

So my thesis is suggesting that there will not be one massive short squeeze but instead a series of squeezes before this thing finally runs out of gas or is regulated into the ground. 

**Let's think about that for a moment.**

If your original PT on GME was $1000, you are already almost there.

The first squeeze took the price from \~$12 to \~$500, \~$488 increase.

The second squeeze took the price from \~$40 to $200, \~$160 increase.

So, already GME has increased around $648. You are now only a $352 increase away from your $1000 PT.

**Is a massive short squeeze still possible?**

**Yes.** However, so much of the DD floating around is all talking about *possibility* but we as investors don't care about that. We care about *probability.* 

So what is the probability of a massive short squeeze? Well, there would need to be a significant catalyst like we had on the first go around such as Cohen joining the board. I think there are still several catalysts which I outline in [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/). There could very well be new catalysts that I have not mentioned since that post, such as Cohen getting appointed CEO as I have learned many believe based on his Tweet. 

Let's talk numbers.

There are two very important numbers that need to be broken for a massive squeeze to be possible. 

$170 - This is the upper limit of the downward channel and if this is broken not only does it indicate a trend reversal and potential massive bounce, but there is little to no resistance to take us to the next important number.

$200 - This is a MASSIVE sell wall. Why? Well, I think this is where a significant amount of shorts are positioned. Probably not right at $200, they probably shorted \~$205 but absolutely do not want anyone to break through that wall.

If this sell wall falls, it could prove to be an incredibly massive squeeze *however* it would need to rise a decent amount beyond the $200 wall and maintain that price point to force shorts under for a long enough time period. 

If this happens, it will begin a domino effect of the well positioned shorts chasing them all the way up to the shorts who entered over $400. At this point, FOMO + shorts covering could certainly drive the price well over $1000.

**But what is the** ***probability*** **that this will happen?**

Without a catalyst or an enormous amount of volume.

Let's consider the first squeeze and volume for reference.

**Jan 22nd:** This was the highest volume at **197,157,900,** the high was 76.76 and the low was 42.32

Absolutely insane volume, but it didn't move the price all that much (I mean at least in comparison to other days)

**Jan 25th:** Volume **177,874,000 H:**159.18 **L:** 61.13

**Jan 26th:** Volume **178,588,000 H:**150.00 **L:** 80.20

**Jan 27th:** Volume **93,396,700 H:** 380.00 **L:** 249.00

**Jan 28th:** Volume **58,815,800 H:** 483.00 **L:** 112.25

**Jan 29th:** Volume **50,259,200 H:** 413.98 **L:** 250.00  


See the pattern?

**25th:** 177M volume to nearly triple the price (160%)

**26th:** Even more volume to only double the price (87%)

**27th:**  Half the volume for a 52% increase 

The volume decrease is directly proportionate the the price increasing/decreasing, with the exception of beyond the 28th as trading was restricted. These first two days were crucial to triggering the squeeze. 

The 28th and beyond trading was restricted, but if everyone could only sell or hold, why wouldn't the price immediately fall? How could there still be support? This was shorts covering. Between just those two days there was \~109,000,000 shares exchanged where nearly everyone could only sell. A *perfect* time for shorts to cover. 

**But I thought when shorts cover the price is suppose to go up?** 

Absolutely...if trading wasn't restricted. Because virtually everyone could only sell, this means that almost all of the shares that were exchanged during these days was purchased by shorts and sold by panic sellers escaping the trading restriction FUD. 

So, as strange as it seems, I think the price going up was *some* shorts covering but for the most part, I think they covered while the price was falling. I know this *seems* counter-intuitive, but regardless of the amount of shares that needed to be covered, the amount of selling was able to drive the price down *while* they covered. Again, think about how there possibly could have been any sort of support while trading was restricted, *someone* was buying massive amounts of shares as the price fell...and it wasn't us.

**So, Hooman, if you think they covered already then why do you think a squeeze is still possible?**

Because of my thesis, entirely new shorts opened entirely new positions. Perhaps some of the old HF's also did to try to recoup some losses. Last week we *almost* forced this to happen all over again, but a TON of new shorts opened positions and the sell wall at $200 prevented us from tipping that very important, very first domino. This isn't the same landscape we were in where shorts were poorly positioned at very low numbers and we were able to catch them with their pants down, this is a different situation entirely. 

That situation is *still* squeezable. The question is...how?

Volume. Volume. Volume.   
Sheer and pure buying power.

We would *need* those first two very important days to happen again and push us past that $200 sell wall AND hold us there in order to force the well positioned shorts to close. We were so damn close but couldn't quite break it. This is precisely why my predictions for Friday were so accurate.

A catalyst, a whale, large global sentiment again, FOMO; there are A LOT of different ways this is *possible,* but as I mentioned before; we as investors deal with *probable.*

In one of my original posts, long before this became a meme stonk, I literally used the word **imminent**  in the title, that's how sure I was that the data and catalysts were aligned to create this perfect storm. If you now notice, all of my titles are **What Comes Next?** That is because this is the honest truth: literally no one knows. Why? Because third part intervention is now required for this to be possible and global sentiment and FOMO has worn off, more than that a lot of people have been burned and all the people who are still willing to play this stock are already bagholding and no longer have the capital to help with momentum. 

This has gone from a sure thing, **to a straight up gamble.** 

If I had to give it a probability, which I really don't want to do I would have to say 50/50. There is nothing significant pointing to anything that could get us past $200, but it is still *possible* with catalysts and other factors. 

What appears more likely is that this will be a series of squeezes up until it is regulated to death, people get bored, or a catalyst pops the MOASS's.

But you *can* be certain of one thing: **this will end.**

It does NOT have to end with a MOASS, but it might. My guess is that if there is no significant catalyst that ignites the MOASS by April, then this will be on pause. The interesting thing is that the *possibility* of a MOASS might never go away, but as time passes the *probability* lessens. 

The reason for my April guess is that is the end of all of my upcoming catalysts that could act as triggers. It is very possible that this thing cools down after that, shorts enter unfavorable positions, and then Cohen makes huge changes that starts this thing all over again a few months later.

That being said, I think the most *probable* outcome is a series of squeezes that quite frankly, we are just along the ride for. There is no where near enough retail buying power anymore to force anything to happen, we are at the whim of institutions and big players who are deciding what comes next. How are they getting away with this? **You.** So long as the world things that Redditor's are the reason this is happening, they can continue playing.

# I've Been Asked By Many of You to Examine the DD posted by u/HeyItsPixeL 

[The DD can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/)

*Disclaimer: Both myself and this author are completely guessing as is everyone else. You should be reading everyones take and drawing your own conclusions.*

**Overall Impression:** Well done DD. There was a lot of work and effort put into this and the assumptions were data driven. I will say, there is a hint of biased mentality here using the data to fit the author's narrative. From a more objective point of view, this simply could have been shorts shorting. From a less objective point of view, it could fit support my thesis of shorts wanting these microsqueezes. Let't go as chronologically as possible.

""On February 23rd GME opened at $44.97. Within the first few seconds GME reached its Day High of $46,23. GME also reached its Day Low at 9:50AM. So within 20 minutes after the market opened, GME reached its high and its low for the whole day!""

""**Conclusion:** Someone got the price down by 10 % within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that, making it seem, that their solely goal was to get GME on the SSR for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low. And that is really important now!""

**My take:** I actually find this quite compelling. Either this was an institution attempting to bait out shorts while preventing a panic sell, or it fits my theory that this was actually a short who wanted a short squeeze. Both ideas are equally nuts, but we live in crazy times.

""**TL;DR:** Hedgies vs. unknown Institutions (UI). UI set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above $50. HF know and don't want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of GME to keep it below $50. Both sides waiting for the other one to do something. Battle will start shortly before the market closes. Just a theory, no advice, ape hoping for banana 🍌💎🤲""

**My Take:** I agree. Large institutions are in this and want a squeeze as much as we do. Either that or a whale buyer like Chamath. I also agree with the $50 assumption, as that was a clear battle ground. Where we disagree is I think that last week was in fact, the gamma squeeze. However, we did not have enough volume to continue off of the gamma squeeze and tip the next, more important domino at $200+.

""On February 25th, there was a short volume of AT LEAST 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 Shares (highest report). ""

**My Take:** Well, first of all I really wish there was a link to this data. But let's go with Fintel's data that shows 33 million short volume on 02/25. If you look at the chart for 02/25 there are two very clear moments where this volume occurred. My guess would be these shorts are positioned between 140-180. This is one of the reasons I have been saying that the **135** resistance is a key point. If this domino can be tipped it will drive us up to the **170 and 200** point, but will we have the volume to break through those gates when we get there? I'm not sure. I mean, I hope so! But I'm not sure.

**Anything about naked shorting or what the actual short interest is or where the shorts are actually hiding, I'm not even going to touch.** Why? Because it doesn't matter.

This goes back to my original point, everyone is running around trying to answer the wrong question and prove that the squeeze has not been squozen. But who cares? I think 5 minutes of research can show you there is still an immense amount of short interest in this stock. What we need to be asking is WILL the squeeze be squozen and if so HOW?

**March 19th:** Including the options chain, XRT data, FTD's, etc. I think this date could in fact act as a catalyst. But that's about it. To me I would just add this to my list of potential catalysts and not think much of it. There is a lot of good information backing this theory, but there is a whole lot more theory backing this theory. In my opinion, this date should just be added to list of potential catalysts that could either A: spark the MOASS or B: It could be the date of another microsqueeze.

**""MY Conclusion**: The squeeze is inevitable.""

**My take:** Absolutely not inevitable. Certainly possible.

# Monday Predictions

Again, this is not including any unforeseen catalysts that could kick this thing off. I can't express that enough. That is why holding is gamble that could really go either way. If something happens whether we see it or not it could send this thing skyrocketing. My predictions for Monday are based on no new catalysts.

Virtually, I am expecting a repeat of Friday that could end differently.

**Open:** I am expecting a sharp price increase at open, volume again will a key indicator as to which direction this is going to go. 

I imagine we will struggle at **115** resistance but we can hopefully blow through that, the real test will come at **135** resistance.

 If we reach **135** and blow through it, then this gets very interesting. I see the next resistance points at **150, 155, and then the really important ones of 170 and 200.** I already explained that if we surpass these limits we are setting up nicely for a MOASS.

If we reach **135** but volume is too low (if you're not sure how to gauge the volume keep an eye on how many times we retest it). If it takes more than two attempts, without a significant volume boost I can't imagine us being able to handle the more difficult resistance points.

**Shortly after Open:** My guess right now is still before 10:00 (but it could go later in the day if I'm wrong about people covering on Friday) if we have not broken through those early resistance points, I think the slow bleed will begin. 

My bottom PT is somewhere between 60-80.

Once we hit this mark, it gets difficult to predict. No one understands at all how the market fairly values this stock. The closest I would say would be 40-50 since thats where the greatest support we had was. It is entirely possible we see a bounce from the 60-80 price if shorts use this opportunity to cover, the market see's it as a good point to enter and ride the wave, or if GME is now simply valued at this price due to the management changes that helped kickstart this second wave to begin with.

After that, it's a blur. This truly is a day to day stock to analyze and sadly I cannot provide this kind of DD every single day. I don't have work Monday so I'm considering live streaming this.

# So What's Your Play Hooman?

Now, some of you will call me a shill\_or\_whatever but I simply have a different tactic. You might believe in the MOASS, but I'm not certain I think it's *probable.* So I will be playing these mircosqueezes instead. 

I mentioned in my last post, I have a really nasty wash sale. From what I understand, this is simply for tax purposes but my cost basis is still being increased by $100. IE if I purchase the stock for $80 my cost basis will be adjusted to $180. I'm still unclear on how this works, if someone could clarify in the comments section I would absolutely love to continue playing this stock. I will be spending the rest of today attempting to find this answer on my own time as well, so if I'm not responsive to the comments like I usually am, please understand I am attempting to prepare for this week.

So...as long as the wash sale isn't an actual reflection of my real price, then I will buy as soon as the market opens. I will wait until we see how we handle resistance and if it looks like we have a shot at winning, **I will buy more there to fight the good fight**. If it looks like there is nowhere near enough volume and my purchase won't make a difference, then that will be my indicator to sell. 

**This part is vital:** If you are SELLING at the resistance points, you are hurting the cause. BUYING at these points is what will break through the wall. But if we make multiple attempts and cannot break through and it starts falling, then you might as well profit. You holding won't change the fact that we couldn't break resistance. **I can't stress this enough**. If you simply sell when we hit resistance, you will be part of the reason the squeeze doesn't happen. So either holding or buying will help push the price up at these targets, but if it is lost no matter what you do, then sell and prepare for another attempt.

Once it gets below 90 I will start scooping up shares again, averaging down with the price (I do this instead of going all in trying to predict the bottom).

From there I will wait to see if that second bounce does in fact happen again. If it does, I will sell at whatever I think the top is and then will re-enter just before close. Again, if there is enough volume and it appears there is a chance to break through then I will not sell, I will buy to try to push through that resistance.

Why would I re-enter just before close? Three reasons:

1. I'm better positioned and back on board in case the MOASS does trigger
2. I won't have to buy at open if we see the same exact pattern on Tuesday.
3. I am bullish on GME thanks to Cohen and would like to re-open my long position.

If the same pattern continues Tuesday, I will repeat this play until the pattern stops and I am sitting on A LOT more shares at a MUCH BETTER cost basis.

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has not been squoze, but it has become closer to 50/50 odds that it will occur. I think its more probable that a series of microsqueezes occur and I will play accordingly. Simply holding does not increase a price, buying does. My play will not only net me profits, but it will increase my buying power significantly. There is no TLDR to justify this post, if you don't feel like reading then you aren't playing with enough money to be concerned and none of this applies to you anyways. Just remember, this will all come to an end at some point and that end is not guaranteed with a squeeze. Happy trading!

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, none of this is advice at all. It is my analysis of the situation that I have been following and my interpretation of the data at hand. The only direct advice I have for anyone is you should do what's best for you. I am bullish on GME long term which makes this a lot less risky for me because if I end up with bags (as long as they aren't too heavy) that's perfectly fine with me. Anyone who tries to convince you I am a shill or bot is almost certainly an uneducated investor, I am not even a bear on this situation, but you should always examine the bear case, not blatantly ignore it in search of confirmation bias.*",stocks,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 6,7426.0,0.85
SulkyVirus,0.0,7341.0,"I've only been trading with real money for about a month, but I read something a few months ago, while doing my research, that really stuck and I wanted to share.

As investors, we often look at the moves we've made and judge ourselves on what we missed on or what we hit on. This is part of growing and learning as an investor.

But the thing that many people forget is the **almost** trades. Those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on, but didn't. Whatever that reason was, we all have moves that we almost made but *something* made us pass on it. 

#Write them down.#

Record every trade that you almost made, or considered making. Record the date, the current value, and the reason you didn't make the trade.

This has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading. We all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think, ""man - if only I held this longer"" or ""I really messed up buying this on the rise"". But what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isn't a history of on our chosen broker. For every single regret we have as traders, there is a dodged bullet that our gut, training, or education helped us avoid. On the flip side, there are also those securities we saw a post about, or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on. Those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting.

If you don't record the moves you **almost** made, then you're missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader. Write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while. The more you write at the time the better.

Hope this can help others as much as it's helped me. Good luck y'all!

Edit: it seems there are a few of you that take it personally and feel the need to insult because I've only been trading with real money for a month. I've also been researching, learning, and trading with virtual accounts for years.

I used to check my stock app every minute and sold because I got nervous and uncomfortable. I would see gains that have made insane money disappear and sell off trying to hopefully get back at a lower price. From personal experience, I would encourage many of you to take one hard look at your stock portfolio right now and ask yourself if this is a company you see being able to exist in the long-term future. If the answer is no, you should cut some of your position or get rid of it. If the answer is yes, sit back, maybe liquidate a few shares, but don't get uneasy about it. It's the stock market - you win some, you lose some. If the company you own isn't going through a fundamental change such as a huge decrease in revenue or an SEC investigation, stop being upset.

If I never sold a single share of any company from the day I started investing, I would likely be a millionaire right now with an initial investment of $30,000. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy companies you trust and can reasonably see being a sustainable business and just ride it. More often than not, you're going to end up green.

Be it stocks or the housing market (which experienced a trailing small crash 2 years after). Those folks got literally everything on a massive discount.

Think about it from that angle. If I have SOME money saved up now and it were 2008 again, I would be fkin ecstatic. Because after 4-5 years I would gain 1000% easily. And that's not even going into real estate.

Also, recent example of last March will confirm my point. I made huge gains from it. I only bought Costco, Etsy and HomeDepot. No technical analysis. No charts. No graphs. Nothing.

rhetorical_twix,0.0,5608.0,"Last week and earlier this week, I've been posting warnings about watching out for increased volatility leading into March, and particularly toward the end of March, which is the end of Q1. We're going to see unwinding of massive positions in the pandemic and tech stocks that were successful in 2020 as institutions and professionals will be forced to change their portfolios to more value oriented stocks that will perform better in high interest rate conditions: commodities, energy, high free cash flow businesses, industrials and financials. I refer to this as ""rotation"" where portfolios evolve from being focused on one sector or asset class to another over time. This Spring, these rotations may not occur in a slow, calm and orderly way. 

Monday, as I said in an earlier post this week, I liquidated most of my positions in the hot stocks of 2020, including EVs, and began focusing on interest-rate proof businesses. These are businesses with lower long term debt, good free cash flow, actual positive profit margins, and good balance sheets. I'm just holding long positions in outright cash purchases of stock, so I don't have complicated positions to ""unwind"" (I just sell a stock to get out of a position). However, institutional and professional investors, and hedge funds, have more complicated and leveraged portfolios. 

We can't expect the unwinding of positions of so-called ""whales"" (big players) in the market to always be orderly or calm as the end of Q1 approaches. 

Yesterday's market dump appears to have been triggered by one or more whales forcefully selling $50B of bonds into a reluctant buyer's market. The below is a good article from Bloomberg but it's premium content so I'll summarize it below because it answers the question, *Why are bond yields spiking despite the Federal Reserve setting its interest rates to banks so low and WTF is going on in the bond market?*

[Chaotic Treasury Selloff Fueled by $50 Billion of Unwinding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/chaotic-treasury-selloff-fueled-by-50-billion-position-unwind)(Paywall)

* **A massive dump of $50B in bonds suggest one (or a few) positions were unwound by one or more whales**  

&gt; “It wasn’t an orderly selloff and certainly didn’t appear to be driven by any obvious fundamental continuation or extension of the reflation thesis,” wrote NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn in a note to clients. 

* **""Fundamental decoupling"" between low interest rates and a heating economy**

Bond and lending pros are rejecting the Federal Reserve's low-interest view, which is at odds with 6-7% growth projected due to stimulus plans and rebound from the pandemic and Powell's talk of ""maximum employment"" plans

&gt; The bond market’s divergence from a fundamental backdrop was most evident at the shorter-end of the curve. Eurodollar contracts -- which are priced off Libor -- collapsed in record volumes as traders repriced their expectations for the path of Fed rates with few obvious catalysts.

* **What exactly happened?  5-year Treasury notes jumped 22 points, and spreads associated with those notes jumped 24 points**

&gt; The main protagonist in the bond market was the five-year Treasury note, a maturity often associated with long-term Fed rate expectations, where yields closed 22 basis point higher on the day. The so-called butterfly-spread index -- a measure of how the note is performing against its two- and 10-year peers -- jumped 24 basis points, the worst daily performance for the sector since 2002.

&gt; Markets now see a Fed hike by March 2023 compared to mid-2023 previously, and have priced in rates over 50 basis points higher by 2024.

&gt; But in remarks this week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell offered reassurance that policy would continue to be supportive and look beyond a temporary pick-up in inflation, especially from a low base. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida expressed cautious optimism on the outlook, he said it would “take some time” to restore the economy to pre-pandemic levels.

* **Bond buyers who disagree with the Fed were ""on strike"" yesterday and created a ""liquidity drought""** 

&gt; A number of more “technical-style” factors were in the mix, against a backdrop of a good-old-fashioned buyers strike...

&gt; A lack of bond market liquidity, just when traders needed it most [i.e. during a big dump of $50B in bonds]

* **Also high frequency trading exists in the bond market too, apparently, and they suddenly disappeared yesterday in a market that was used to their presence, at the same time buyers thinned out**

&gt; “We think that a steep decline in market depth contributed to the outsized moves in yields today,” wrote JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategist Jay Barry in a note to clients. Barry showed how the share of high-frequency traders in the Treasury market -- which has been on an increasing trend -- tends to retreat rapidly as volatility spikes.

I expect to see more volatility as positions from 2020 unwind and people create whole new portfolios for post-pandemic 2021. This is a good time to look at which stocks are the ones doing well each day and why. 

Disclaimer: Not a financial professional

Edit: I plan to reenter tech stocks hardcore once these whales are done with whatever BS they do at the end of every quarter whenever there are big changes.

__________________________

Edit 2: Here's an addition of more material offered by /u/TomatoeHaven from other references (I have not checked them)

**What impact, if any, does the Fed have on Treasury Yield?**

Note: Treasury yield briefly topped the 1.6% level on Thursday and traded at its highest level in more than a year, raising concern for investors across asset classes.

“To be sure, if bond yields continue to rise and there is a smooth rotation out of growth and defensive stocks into value and cyclical stocks, the Fed will remain sanguine,” strategist Albert Edwards of Societe Generale said in a note. “But the risk is growing that with so many bubbles blown by the Fed something will burst soon.”

Edit 2: There’s a rumor that BB executives sold shares with the incentive to leave, remit ownership from BB, or have concerns of company being overvalued. Shares given to these executives are part of their salary compensation, so under company policy, they have every right to sell shares for capital gains.

Espeonaga,0.0,5297.0,"I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.

Here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.

[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  
[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security’s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.

[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.

[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.

[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a ""cloud"" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.

[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.

MA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

Pivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.

SAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.

SuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",stocks,Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market,5297.0,0.96

MrMooMoo-,0.0,4903.0,"**Disclaimer:** I'm heavily simplifying a very complex topic for the sake of keeping this post brief.

Folks, close your trading app. Take a deep breath. Relax.  This is not the apocalypse. This is not the armageddon.

Before I get into what's happening, here is a bit of perspective: Even with yesterday's selloff, NASDAQ ended at 13,533. I can't see what the index is like pre-market, but QQQ is down 1.35% as I write this. So let's assume it opens 13,350.

That's still 280 points higher than the post-January selloff (low of 13,070). That's also still 462 points higher than December 31st (we closed at 12,888). In %, that's 2.14% and 3.58% higher, respectively.

Now I know that a lot of you are trading on highly volatile stocks (looking at you, CRSR and PLTR), so obviously they are hit much harder than NASDAQ. That's the nature of the beast. Volatile stocks = large swings, both up and down. Welcome to the flip side. I have some of those in my portfolio, and also some defensive and cyclical stocks. It sucks those volatile positions deep in the red. I know how you all feel.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what's happening?

**Treasury yields are rising.** That's what's happening. There's obviously more to it (I.e.: vaccination seems to be going relatively well, Biden's stimulus, etc.), but that seems to be the catalyst. In fact, the 10-year yield rose to its highest level in the last year, at 1.37%. **That's a good thing:** Rising yields are a sign of economic recovery and increasing economic activity. It's a good thing.

Why are yields rising if interest rates remain low? Because of one of the fundamentals of yields: As bond prices rise, everything else being equal, yields will drop. And the inverse is also true. As bond prices drop, yields will rise. And right now, bond prices are dropping. People are becoming more and more optimistic about the prospect of recovery, with Biden's stimulus and with the vaccination that is (once again, relatively) going well. So they are exiting ""safe"" investments with lower yields in favor of riskier investments with higher yields: junkier bonds, stock market and alternative investments.

Wait, if rising yields are a sign of people exiting the bond markets to go towards the stock markets, why are prices dropping????? Great question, and my answer is twofold: (1) NASDAQ is not even in market correction territory, Chill. It closed roughly down 5% from all time highs yesterday. (2) Look at S&amp;P500 and DIJA. DIJA is a winner in this, and S&amp;P is barely phased.

So back to my explanation, people are leaving bond markets for markets with higher potential returns, and the stock markets is one of them. Now, the reality is that rising yields are not always immediately good for markets, especially overheated markets like NASDAQ: This can spook a lot of investors and cause a selloff, which is essentially what's happening right now. This doesn't mean, however, that the apocalypse is upon us. Remember one of the reasons why the markets have skyrocketed so much in the last year: Actual interest rates, not yields, are near zero, and will remain near zero for the foreseeable future. This is crucial. New bond issuance will still have shit for yields, this isn't changing.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should we do?** That's entirely up to you. I'm no financial advisor. I'm no expert. Take everything I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm no expert. But really, I'm barely doing anything. I'll be taking a page from Cathy's book: keeping a close eye on when this new craze slows down, sell some of my ""safer, less impacted stocks"" to raise cash and buy the ones that were hit hardest.

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see ""Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..."" by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--&gt; The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**

Just read this post. It's quite revealing:

[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)

**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&amp;LangLocaleID=1033&amp;Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.
*****
&gt; While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound – financials, airlines and industrials – stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.
*****
&gt; Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.
*****
&gt; The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
*****
&gt; He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.
*****
&gt; “He’s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. “It is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.”
*****
&gt; But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.
*****
&gt; # Improving forecasts
&gt; Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.
*****
&gt; Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.
*****
&gt; The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.
*****
&gt; ″[Powell’s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He’s going to be supportive of the administration’s effort to get a big package through,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
*****
&gt; # Key data during the week
&gt; Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy’s and TJX.
*****
&gt; Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday
*****
&gt; The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.
*****
&gt; “I think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; “I think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,” he said.
*****
&gt; “The caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that’s going to go away sooner than we think,” Keon said. “Right now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That’s also due to the fact we’re likely to get a big stimulus package.”
*****
&gt; He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.
*****
&gt; “I think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We’re still bullish. We’re still overweight stocks,” Keon said.
*****
&gt; He said a flood of money could hit the economy.
*****
&gt; “The size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,” Keon added. “Households now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.”
*****
&gt; He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. “You’re going to see an incredible boom.”

&gt; # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps

&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**

&gt; Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.

&gt; Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).

&gt; # Industrial Metals Shining Bright

&gt; While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals—as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index—are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**

&gt; Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.

&gt; Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.

&gt; # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak

&gt; “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage “stairs up, elevator down” certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&amp;P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.

&gt; The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn’t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?

&gt; **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it’s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.

&gt; **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in “stay at home” themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. “It’s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Drawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.” If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year’s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.

&gt; Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

&gt; # Stimulus Matters: Retail Sales Rebound Big in January

&gt; The US economy had a tumultuous year in 2020, to say the least, and after rebounding strongly in the third quarter, the holiday surge in COVID-19 cases increased the risk that the economy may stumble heading into the new year. The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.

&gt; Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December—ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales—consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau—the most in seven months—and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.

&gt; Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Fiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.”

&gt; Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January’s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn’t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.

&gt; Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4–4.5% to 5–5.5%. Yesterday’s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target—and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.

&gt; However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden’s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.

&gt; # Tech Leading in New Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&amp;P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&amp;P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**

&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.

&gt; # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead

&gt; One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**

&gt; We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&amp;P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.

&gt; # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?

&gt; Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.

&gt; This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.

&gt; We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.

COST stock is one of the best in the market – and it's now on sale](https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/)

COST stock has declined over 9% so far in 2021. It’s down 12% from late November highs.

But for a name like Costco, a 12% move is rather significant. It’s not just significant – it’s a buying opportunity.



Costco did take a modest hit during the pandemic, in part due to store closures. For instance, in April same-store sales excluding gasoline and foreign currency effects were flat. That’s a huge disappointment by Costco’s high standards.

But as stores reopened, Costco immediately got back on track. In June, for instance, same-store sales rose 14% on the same basis. For the third quarter (ending May 10), Costco drove 4.8% same-store growth. In Q4, the figure accelerated to better than 11%. Growth in December and January averaged better than 8%.

There’s not much in the numbers to suggest anything has changed. The pandemic caused a bit of volatility, yes, but Costco still grew adjusted same-store sales 9% in FY2020 and 6% the year before.
As far as e-commerce goes, the pandemic has given Costco a chance to build out its own business. E-commerce revenue grew 50% in FY2020 and climbed another 18% through the first 22 weeks of FY2021.

Remember that Costco’s profit comes largely from membership fees. In FY2020, for instance, membership fees were about 65% of operating profit. which was actually down from 71% the year before. Essentially, Costco turns about 1% of its sales into operating profit, then tacks on membership revenue.

That membership revenue is benefiting from customers acquired last year. Most are going to stick around for the long haul. The boost here isn’t like that of, say, a grocery store, whose sales will return to pre-pandemic levels as normalcy returns.

Remember also that membership revenue is part of why COST stock is expensive – and has been for years. Yes, this is a fantastically well-run company. But the model’s reliance on membership fees creates faster growth as well.

An extra dollar in membership fees drops to the operating profit line at huge margins. And so Costco can grow earnings faster than most any other brick-and-mortar retailer.",stocks,Costco Stock Is an Easy Buy on the Dip COST stock is one of the best in the market – and it's now on sale,4073.0,0.94

Before I get started I want to apologize, this will be a smaller less detailed version than I had hoped and I will not be releasing a video as I feel extremely under the weather. However, I have received a large volume of messages regarding part 4 and my analysis, so here it is.

First, let's address something that I find very misleading: ""this happened on absolutely no news""

Well, that simply isn't true. I will mention some key things that led up to this point and would like to also quickly mention the 3-day rule. If ER is bad, you follow the 3 day rule meaning you give it 3 days to bleed before it begins to recover. This is the same for the news cycle. Even the first squeeze when Cohen was announced to be joining the board, it took several days before the market react.

Ok, so let's talk news. 

1. We have passed the first potential catalyst which was the first GME hearing [which unfortunately, was filled with useless information](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/comments/lnkmrn/gamestop_gme_short_squeeze_congressional_hearing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).
2. Another catalyst I mentioned was today, the short interest report that was post Jan. 28th spike. [Morningstar](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) is reporting 60% and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) is reporting 24%. Again, the discrepancy between the two is simply based on a calculation difference using a different float. One is including synthetic longs while the other is not. This is the first mention I could find regarding the [XRT discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt_is_being_used_to_hide_gme_shorts_xrt/) and how shorts may have actually essentially moved their positions into an ETF that includes GameStop. At this point, there are so many moving parts and distrust, I'm having trouble assessing what the true short interest might be. Regardless, even if we use the 24% figure and respect that to be true, [this is still considered very high.](https://www.powercycletrading.com/what-is-a-high-short-interest-ratio/#:~:text=Regardless%2C%20most%20options%20traders%20would,above%2020%25%20is%20extremely%20high)
3. Following [iborrowdesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) we can also see a significant amount of new short positions opening over the past several days, probably an attempt to short the stock but without it being reported in todays numbers.
4. Chamath also expressed anger regarding how the Congressional hearing went and followed it up with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1363571801289154560). I personally believe Chamath was one of the several large buy orders today.
5. Ryan Cohen also [tweeted one of his infamous emoji tweets](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289). Now, I'm not going to bother to attempt to decipher it, but when he Tweets, GME spikes much like when Elon tweets about Doge, it spikes. 
6. The [GameStop CFO ""resigns""](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/23/tech/gamestop-cfo-resigns/index.html#:~:text=New%20York%20(CNN%20Business)%20After,his%20roles%20on%20March%2026) which later news indicates he didn't really willingly resign. This is extremely bullish as GameStop continues to make changes. If the company was losing money for years and the man in charge of money was just fired, this is a *good* thing.
7. [DFV doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnqgz8/gme_yolo_update_feb_19_2021/)

**Ok, now let's discuss some of these things**

1. The GameStop hearing was simply a joke. The next hearing will paint a more clear picture regarding data as the SEC, FINRA, and potentially, the DTCC will be present.
2. Let's talk short interest. As I have mentioned in previous parts, I have no doubt that original shorts have covered and new shorts have entered. A clear battle I have had in the comments is a lot of individuals seem to believe that shorts only re-opened their positions at the top and that's it. I couldn't disagree with this more. The narrative of GME being a dying brick and mortar company is alive and well, and shorts will continue opening positions all the way down. We saw many new positions open today when it was around $50. There are shorts everywhere, and they completely doubt this company and everyones willingness to hold and continue purchasing more, both for retailers and institutions. 
3. Chamath, Cohen, and DFV was a much needed intervention which brought back excitement and truthfully, they probably purchased more shares themselves. 

**Sorry had to take a bathroom break, like I said I'm feeling very unwell and apologize that this isn't quite as good as my other posts.**

**Let's talk about what happened today**

I believe today was a gamma squeeze with shorts in the worst positions having to cover. I concur with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/) regarding the gamma squeeze and how it started the domino effect. 

I predicted that a large sum of shorts were sitting just over $200 and the AH action helps bolster that claim. We saw the price touch $200 for a moment and then get swatted down like it was a gnat. They absolutely do not want it to break the $200 mark.

**But onto the important part, my predictions as to what comes next**

Now, I'm about to say something very silly but the reason is I want you to make your own decision on what the most likely outcome is.

Tomorrow, either the price will come plummeting down, or it will rise to new, extraordinary heights.

1. Reason for it to shoot down: There are a lot of bagholders, a lot of individuals who are simply trying to escape with at least their money back. Depending on pre-market, we could expect a large sell off at open as people reclaim their losses. This sell-off will induce a panic sell that causes everyone to exit in an attempt to mitigate as many losses as possible.
2. Reason for it to shoot up: There are a lot of bagholders...who won't be satisfied by just breaking even and will refuse to exit until it breaks $1000-$2000. Depending on pre-market there will also be a lot of people who missed the first run have less doubt in their mind for a potential second run. FOMO and sheer buying power will continue to drive the price upward.

Both of these are considering retail investors only, although the ATH price action compared to volume suggests there are significant amounts of institutional and ""large whale"" buyers getting in on the action. They both are also dependent on pre-market so let's talk about that for a moment.

**Pre-Market**

While institutional buyers don't necessarily need retail for this to work, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have reinforcements, so I think they won't begin a bull run until the market opens and retail investors have a final chance to double down while new investors have a chance to purchase their tickets. 

However, if they seemingly don't care and want to buy as soon as able then we will test that $200 resistance. If that is broken...this is going to be absolutely wild. The domino effect will continue upward chasing the shorts who entered at the very top. It would be wise for these shorts to cover prior to it reaching them as they could still take profits and walk away with a significant sum of money. This will propel the price extremely high at which point nearly all shorts would have exited. 

**During Trading Hours**

Again, completely dependent on pre-market, but I still expect a decent sell-off in the beginning of the day as bagholders escape with breaking even happily. If we open above the $200 mark and the selloff does not appear to be driving us below, I expect the shorts who entered their to cover and this reaches parabolic heights.

**Price Targets**

Well, I first want to talk about the infinite squeeze notion. I agree with the sentiment but not for the same reasons most users post about. Here's the thing, everyone still considers GME to be a dying brick and mortar retailer aside from few longs such as myself. That narrative is slowly changing as more and more individuals start to see the significant changes being made within the company. So long as this mentality lives on...so does repetition.

I expect this squeeze to conclude sometime this week, perhaps even tomorrow. What's unique here is we have all now lived through the first one and we will make decisions accordingly, IE taking profits or covering earlier. 

But on the way back down....shorts will open new positions....again. 

A new catalyst will arrive....again.

And we will squeeze...again.

I'm not sure how many times this will happen, but I think after 3/25 ER when Cohen globally explains the changes being made and the plans for the company, the narrative will begin to change on GME's business. Until the narrative changes, I expect shorts to continue re-entering at dangerous positions. $50 sounds like a fantastic place to short if you believe this is a dead company, but the market sentiment is changing rapidly on the potential of this company. Once shorts are only entering at ridiculously high numbers, then we will finally see the end of the GME saga. 

I think a second squeeze will be evidence enough to shorts to not enter at such low numbers, however, greed and doubt goes a long way. So it's very possible this is the final squeeze, but I'm not holding my breath. I will address how I plan on playing this in the next section, but first, some price targets.

So long as we break the $200 resistance, we will have many short positions above that level that will close to avoid getting caught in the red as well as gamma squeeze mechanics at play. That being said, I could see $500 being possible as early as tomorrow. Now the top is so difficult to predict because one of the largest factors is the most unpredictable; the people. Many people were burned by GME and many others have serious FOMO. If there is large volume, then that will be my indicator that people are piling in all over again. If this is the case, I see $1-$2k being possible. If bagholders simply want to exit and take their money back then I think $500 might be the dream peak. 

**So whats your play Hooman?**

Well, as I have said before I am long on GME. So I will be trimming on the way up and leaving some just in case it continues to parabolic heights. I will then re-enter when I believe we hit the bottom which I feel confident starting to re-enter at $70 adding more on the way down. I will then hold tight for another potential squeeze and repeat this process until finally, the GameStop narrative has changed and I could leave my shares along for several years. 

**Again, I do apologize** 

I know this isn't quite as good as my previous posts, but I wanted to update everyone who was asking me to provide them with my analysis. Part 5 will be coming regardless of what happens tomorrow as I stated numerous times, I don't think this story is anywhere near over, not until April do I think we will start seeing it slow down. 

**TL;DR:** Today was most likely a gamma squeeze coupled with some shorts covering. There were significant catalysts and whales to propel this thing. I don't think the GameStop story is anywhere near over. I'm sick sorry this was choppy writing compared to other posts.

seldomsage,0.0,3374.0,"I recently got back on Reddit after a long hiatus - the volatility in Gamestop and other names brought me back to r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.

Lately I have been doing some research on Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and am quite alarmed by what I am seeing. I am by no means an expert in finance, but I work in finance professionally. I spent 2 years on a long-short equity hedge fund in NYC right after college, and have worked in M&amp;A for an asset management firm for the last 5.5 years. I am intimately aware of how active and passive (ETF) investment products function and acutely aware of the impact that investor fund flows can have on price and performance of an ETF.

In the case of $ARKK and the family of ETFs, it is glaringly apparent to me that all of these ETFs in the last 12-14 months have become victims of their own success. What do I mean by this?

We'll use $ARKK as an example. In the last 14 months, investors (and many of you) plowed money into $ARKK at a stunning rate - $10 billion in 2020, and another $5 billion in just the first two months of 2021. In conjunction with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.

I ran an analysis on the weekly net flows into ARKK over the last 60 weeks, and found that portfolio performance of the ETF was highly correlated with ETF inflows.

***Correlation of 70%***

***R-squared of 0.49*** 

That is to say, the tail is wagging the dog! ARKK has created its own good performance, but not because the companies have grown or fundamentally improved. Nearly entirely the result of the ETF buying.

What happens next?

Last week was a taste of the trouble ahead. When investors sell the ETF instead of buy, in order to cash out the investors the ETF must sell some of the stock in its portfolio companies, except that liquidity or lack of liquidity becomes a much bigger problem when investors are selling and when the broad equity/tech markets have a correction.

The ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs. If the fund can generate returns of 350% in roughly a year, just imagine what may happen if investors move toward the exits in a much shorter period of time.

As someone who takes pride in my analytical work, and who is concerned about the limited investor knowledge of many people who own Cathie Wood's funds, I would strongly encourage you to do more research. Learn about the companies held by the ETFs. Try to educate yourselves on valuation methods. And please understand that unless you are willing to lose every dollar that you have invested with Ark, you should take some time to reflect on the risks you are taking.

After spending a very short amount of time on this subreddit and others, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of these risks, and unfortunately the small investors in Cathie's funds will be the ones who bear the brunt of any crisis.

As usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for thought that Cathie has sold a chunk of her company to American Beacon. In recent months there were changes to these ownership arrangements that are not publicly known. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.

Good luck and I hope I am wrong.

***Edit*** - for inquiring minds, the link below is a detailed and succinct overview of some of these concerns from a Fintwit personality.

https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1366028953828270082

***Edit*** - some have pushed back on the analysis and I appreciate the discussion, for additional thoughts on how some of these ETF products (and ETF's in general) can create distortions in the market, there are a few podcasts below that I found pretty worthwhile.

https://www.zer0es.tv/interviews-and-analysis/the-perversion-of-passive-investment/

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-end-game-ep-3-mike-green/id1508585135?i=1000483139066

***Edit*** - some have suggested I re-create the analysis above on a number of more typical ETF products (great idea) to see if outcomes are similar. Some have also pushed back on the statistical significance of 70%/0.49. In finance if you can explain 49% of the variation using just one variable, it is pretty darn good. Not so good in physics or hard sciences.

In any case, here goes...

Background on methods and sources: Data comes from simfund, and the analysis is simple. We build a ""roll forward"" of the assets under management (AUM) for weekly flow data sets. An AUM roll forward is commonly found in the earnings presentations of all asset managers and is useful for understanding the sources of AUM growth in any given period.

In this case:

A:   Beginning of period AUM        &lt;--- Sourced from Simfund

B:   +/- Net New Investor Flows   &lt;--- Sourced from Simfund

C:   +/- Market Performance        &lt;--- Implied by D less B less A

D:   End of Period AUM                &lt;--- Sourced from Simfund


In this way we can see how many dollars flow into a certain ETF over the period, and how many dollars of market gains in the underlying portfolio took place in the same period. Presumably these two values (B&amp;C) would be more highly correlated when B is large and the underlying portfolio is less liquid - causing upward pressure on prices for structural reasons rather than fundamental reasons, i.e. driven by the ETF and not by growth or fundamental improvement in the portfolio companies, i.e. paying a higher multiple for the same stock for no good reason.

I think my analysis stands... but open to more constructive criticism.

***Edit*** - Criticism of this approach may be that I am using dollar changes in both flows and portfolio returns, rather than periodic percentage changes, however my view is that it is the magnitude of the dollar flows that matters more than percentages when trying to ascertain the impact of illiquidity and investor flows.

***Edit*** - Worthy correction from u/notredwan - I was under the impression that American Beacon was in process on exercising its option to acquire a majority position in Ark as was originally agreed in 2016. Evidently that option was extinguished in December 2020 in a deal where Ark took on debt (and likely warrants) to pay off American Beacon on the option value. Back of the envelope math would have put the option value in the $100-150mm range.

***Edit*** - An interesting easter egg in Ark's daily email update and associated disclosures. Quoting from the thread linked below.

On Friday, February 26, ARK expanded its daily trade email disclaimer to 718 words compared to 163 words on Thursday, February 25.

Two new disclaimers:

""Additional risks of investing in ARK ETFs include market, management, concentration and non-diversification risks""

""There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue..”

[GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrxbvv/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_4/)

Before we get into what happened today I would like you all to know that I have sadly closed my position. I sold at the top today and then wanted to buy back in at the bottom but forgot about a little thing called wash sales. That being said when I purchased at 147 my cost basis was actually showing at \~250. Now, this is just for tax purposes however it was factored into margin and completely eliminated me from other trades and would have kept me sidelined for quite some time. I made the decision to close my position entirely and put a large sum of my capital into ACTC which will be my next DD. Sadly, I need to wait 30 days for the wash sale to wear off before I could re-enter GME. This bars me from participating in any upcoming squeezes without substantial risk and it prevents me from entering a long position prior to the 3/25 Earnings Report. This is very sad news indeed. However, I am extremely interested in what is happening and will continue monitoring the situation. I might play options although they are entirely to hard to predict, but I will be re-entering as soon as the wash sale wears off.

Side note: I am feeling better but not well enough to film, so for those who have been waiting for videos this week I do apologize, I will have content coming out as soon as I am able to record.

**So let's talk about today**

Well, if you read my last DD (Part 4) today went exactly as expected all the way up until the end. There was one crucial part I missed and that was the top of the downward channel which was $170. I kept mentioning $200 as an important number but completely disregarding the top of the channel. 

Alright, so pre-market kind of went sideways and that seemed to bode well for us. At open we saw a massive dip, my prediction was that this would be a sell-off of profit taking and bag holders leaving with their original investment. I still maintain that belief. We found the bottom at around $102 which was impressive to me so the following bounce seemed natural. We had several halts along the way and I want to clarify to everyone that this is completely normal.

Halting trades happens for those of us who can't be behind a computer at all times. It gives us a moment to catch up and make our decision. It also prevents a price from plummeting due to panic selling as it essentially pauses the trade to let people calm down and orders hold off for a second. It works well in the opposite direction to prevent FOMO from kicking in and prices rising to irrational heights quickly. 

I think a majority of the price action today was a combination of poorly positioned shorts covering and FOMO for a second squeeze. That in conjunction we scalpers and day traders, I think we simply had a lot of people playing this for profits on this push which gave us the volume and buying power we needed to surpass certain levels. 

We tested a few places on the way up, and some of those tests were rejected. The volume was able to push us through after 1-3 attempts. However, we met with the top of the channel, the $170 mark and at that point, we had no more gas, we had no more volume. We simply couldn't break through, there was a false break which brought us to the days high, but not enough to truly break out. If we did break it we would have been met by the massive sell wall at $200 which we surely would not have had the volume to break. We then were completely exhausted and were forced down significantly. In short, today was not our day.

There is a silver lining, even with AH we somehow ended up finishing over $106. This gives me hope. Let's immediately hop into what comes next.

**So...what comes next?**

All of the catalysts mentioned in Part 4 are still in effect, this has not changed. There are still many shorts sitting above $200 and some probably opened positions on the way down again. 

**Tomorrow** there is something still interesting to me. The fact that we ended over $100 and options expire tomorrow makes me thing there is still gas in this rocket to go for a second push tomorrow. No bears, no one really, could have expected this to close over $100 today, so a lot of calls are dangerously ITM. Tomorrow will be an all out assault for sure to try to drive the price as low as possible prior to the options expiring. Not only will this assault need to be dealt with, but nothing has changed with the $170 channel ceiling or the Wall of Troy at $200. Be warned folks, this is a battle. It is winnable, but a battle indeed. 

Without a known catalyst, this will be *extremely* difficult to win. Many things could happen, from whales jumping in to last minute news such as Cohen being named CEO (a leading theory regarding Ryan Cohen's mysterious tweet). 

Tomorrow, I expect the opposite reaction from today. Before I elaborate I would like to remind everyone: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I a wizard. I could be completely wrong about all of this. So please, do your research, make your decisions. Don't base your financial choices off of my one opinion. 

I digress, I expect an opposite reaction tomorrow with all the diamond handed apes riding whales screaming war cries in their final push before entering the gates of Valhalla. So I expect a massive run-up right at open. The question is...will it be enough? **Pay close attention to volume tomorrow and pay close attention to important resistance points we say today: 135, 152,155, 170.**

If volume low, that means everyone is waiting for everyone else to do something; this is assuredly a losing strategy. There will need to be a significant amount of volume to break through the first wall at 135. Hold on.

To make this more clear it is actually good to think of this like war. Imagine volume as the number of troops you have and imagine each resistance point as a gate you are storming. If you don't have the troops (volume) to break through the first gate (resistance point), you will need to regroup (consolidate) and try again. But each of these attempts uses more and more troops (volume), which means less (troops) to fight break through the following gates (resistance points).

So pay attention to volume and pay attention to resistance points and how many attempts you are taking to break each one. Without a general (a catalyst/whale) this will be a very difficult and potentially bloody battle tomorrow. 

From the oppositions perspective, they have two options. They could either bring troops out to meet you (try to force the price down right at open) or they can sit behind their gates and hold the line (bull trap). As I mentioned before, my guess is they will bull trap, why? Because that's what I would do. If we knew you couldn't break the 170 resistance on the first attempt with your whole army, why would we be concerned about reaching it with less troops? Again, volume is key to monitor.

If you see low volume + sharp price increase, it is likely the bull trap I am expecting, so have buy orders ready to go near resistance points and don't waste your resources trying to climb to them. 

If you see high volume + sharp price increase, then they probably sent troops out to meet you but you are winning.

If you see low volume + sharp price decrease, then it seems your reinforcements haven't arrived and you will need a miracle to save you.

If you see high volume + sharp price decrease, then they are winning.

If you are driven back then at least you are driven to reinforcements (IE: If the price is sent downward then it will be a good buying opportunity for more people to jump in and help the fight). Again, volume here is key. If you see a bounce back, make sure the volume is high enough to justify it, otherwise you are charging back into battle without enough reinforcements and will certainly lose. 

**After Tomorrow**

Until April I see potential for a squeeze, one even larger than the first. But every day that passes, every micro-squeeze in between weakens our side. Play it smart. Sell at what you think is the top, buy back in at the bottom. Rinse. Repeat. This gives each person more and more capital on every attempt. Placing buy orders around the resistance points to help break down the gates is essential. I want to clarify here, the only people who should be playing this are ones who are long on GME to begin with. At some point, this will all settle down, come back to Earth and you will be left with a lot of shares (especially if you keep selling and re-entering). 

The reason this works is because it's literally exactly what the shorts want. **The shorts want a short squeeze.** Yeah see, I said it. Everyone on every side is profiting on this phenomenon aside from the few casualties (bag holders) caught in the crossfire. They drive the price down by shorting it, then they cover to help trigger the short squeeze. You all ride it on the way up allowing them to open new very favorable positions not possible on other stocks and they ride it back down. The cycle continues. 

This is going to be the unfavored opinion, but the notion of diamond handing it til death isn't a winning tactic unless you have the capital to continue adding at the bottom. To win the war, that capital must be generated and what better way than this infinite game of profitable yo-yo?

**Diamond handing worked when there was 226% short interest and that is no longer the case.** 

**Diamond handing does not force a short squeeze, it only did the first time due to these conditions.** 

**Diamond handing worked because the shorts would be screwed if there was no one to buy their shares anymore, this is no longer reality. People are willing to sell their shares, if the price action doesn't convince you of that I don't know what will.** 

There is only one way to force a short squeeze. **Power.** Buying power that is. 

Again, I am not giving advice. This is my perspective and how I think a squeeze is possible WITHOUT a catalyst. 

**TL;DR:** I am not a spreader of FUD, I am a realist. If you are going to continue playing GME then you should find a way to profit from it. Volume is key. Important prices are: 135, 150, 155, 170, 200. The potential for tomorrow squeezing certainly exists with us finishing off at $106. They would have needed to send it much lower to make this be over. However, without a catalyst it will be a difficult battle indeed. This very well may have been the second squeeze, but as I mentioned in Part 4, I don't expect it to be the last one if it is, in fact, over.

I know and understand this is not a fool proof method, but it’s worked very well for me, and I think it could help some people to try and be critical and balanced, without pumping or cheerleading. It’s a two tiered system, and seems to provide all the necessary questions I need answering when I’m trying to decide to throw money at someone. 

**CORE**

&gt;Product

-Is it something people have/find value in? Beneficial? Desirable? etc. You gotta have a good product.

&gt;Management Focus

-Are the managers clowns, or industry pro's? Do they have a plan? Are they focused? Got vision? Will they take the company in a direction I think is profitable?

&gt;Revenue

-How much revenue do they generate? Where does the spending money come from? How are sales? Service?

&gt;Debt vs Assets

-Are they in the black or upside down like Stranger Things? Do they owe more than they make? What do they own that makes them money, vs what they have borrowed on that costs them money? How's the overhead?

&gt;Risk

-Is it a pretty safe bet short term/long term? Does it seem feasible that they will grow or prosper, vs fall and break their own teeth out?

**Shell**

&gt;Hype

-Are people taking about them? In the news? Is fucking reddit jerking off about them?

&gt;Price

-Do I have to take a 2nd mortgage out to afford a good position? Can I pick up enough to make a fair profit with money I already have, or do I gotta clear some other holdings out to be where I want share wise?

&gt;Potential

-Is the product, sector, industry, or climate even receptive to the business model? Is this some Beannie Babies shit, or the best thing since sliced bread?

&gt;Activity

-Has the company even active? Are they enthusiastically pursuing success? Taking steps to be better? More efficient? Relevant? Innovative? Or, are they coasting along like a fat guy in Lazy River?

TayahuaJ,0.0,2799.0,"Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to ""re-opening"" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:

If a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.

Contrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. 

Think of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.

Conversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?

The point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. 

My two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft ""growth"" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. 

Kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.

Buy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.",stocks,Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.,2799.0,0.97
Floofyboy,0.0,2756.0,"People seem to think because we had 2 big crash close together in 2000 and 2008, we are bound to have one soon.


I want to remind people before the year 2000, we had a 20 years bullish run. Its totally not impossible we get to 2030 with no crash, especially now that the feds baby sit the market.


Secondly, we have extremely nice upcoming market conditions. Stimulus checks will either get people to spend money to stimulate the economy, or get them to invest, both will help the stock market. The media is somehow trying to make us believe this is bad, but i think its just bullshit. Inflation has been ultra low for way too long, and feds actually want it to increase. They said many times they won't increase rates before 2023.


Thirdly, i also think we have more upcomming money sources coming into the market than ever. People from other countries invest in US stock market. With all the GME hype, more people than ever are joining in. Again media trying to twist this to say its ""bad"", but obviously it isn't bad.


Another point is, crashes usually happen for a reason, its not random. You can google any of past market crash and find the exact reason it happened. None of these factors are happening right now.


Another point is, there is a key difference between today and 2000. In 2000, the overvalued .com companies which had PE ratios of 200.... were literally worth nothing! These companies had never made a single profit! Once people realized they invested massively in a .com web site worth jackshit... they sold it obviously. They had no reason to hold their shares.


Now check this image about Nasdaq's PE Ratios: https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150305131443-nasdaq-pe-780x439.jpg


Obviously, you can see the 2000's pe ratios were stupid. This graph is from 2015 when it was at 31.7. What is it today? Nasdaq PE ratio as of February 25, 2021 is 38.5!!!!  5x lower than the 2000s. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio


Its irrelevant if the big hedge funds remove their money from apple and want to scare you into selling your shares. Apple is a massive amazing company that is really worth a lot, and they do make tons of profits. Its not comparable in any ways to the dot com bubble. If other people are stupid and sell their shares, SO WHAT? You will just be able to buy into this amazing company for cheaper.



So hold your shares and stop worrying about a 2000 level crash, its not happening.


A correction? Maybe. But who cares, this just slows us down a little. Corrections are healthy and help us avoid a real crash.

Bl1zza,0.0,2692.0,"Now let me start off by saying that I am very bullish on Palantir when talking about the company, their software, and their operations. However, when it comes to the stock, I don’t really see a lot of short-term growth (talking 1-2 years). 

My strong conviction was ever increased as I watched their Demo-Day livestream a while back. I believe that Karp’s vision of them being the world’s most important software company may very well become true someday. My conviction in Palantir and their future is perhaps stronger than on any other growing company. 
However, when it comes to their stock price and valuation, I am standing back. I initially bought in at around $15 dollars, saw the first run up to $30 and then averaged up after the drop to around $22. I held and sold my entire position at the peak of $44 (I got lucky timing, for once). This was before the lock-up period ended. I knew this price point wouldn’t hold with the lock-up approaching so I sold my position after more than doubling my money.

Now that the lock-up has expired, the amount of added shares to the public has resulted in a large shift in relation of the share price - to - market cap. I would’ve found yesterdays $24 as a buying opportunity BEFORE the lock-up, but not anymore. Palantir now has a $50B market cap on ~ $1B annual revenue, that is insane, no matter the future growth prospects. They will not reach even close to $2B in revenue in 2021 and people are shouting $50 or $100 share price targets for EOY. This is utterly detached from reality. A $50 price tag would mean a ~ $100B market cap on +$1B in revenue, and $100 would be a $200B market cap. No matter the current nature of the market, valuations still do matter (no matter how alarmingly little at the moment). 

I would personally love to re-enter Palantir, but I am not going to at the current prices. I’d re-enter at around or sub $30B market cap. The share price would have to obviously drop quite significantly, but the lock-up period has drastically changed the relation of the share-price to Palantir’s valuation when compared to the time before the lock-up. I personally do not see anything above $20 as a steal, but rather overvalued in current and short-term (1-2 years) perspectives. I understand people looking long-term (that’s great), but I’d rather enter something else for now than sail relatively flat for the next year or two on current valuations. 

I’ll probably get downvoted to the core of the earth because Palantir has that same unhinged and almost religious following that Tesla has for example, but this is just my level-headed two cents to my fellow retail investors.

It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

&gt;Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

&gt;GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon

Fragsworth,0.0,2434.0,"This is a story that \*involves\* GME, but it is not \*about\* GME.

The events I'm describing here happened on January 28 in my cash retirement account.

In short, I had some GME shares, and used the interface to sell them immediately after I read that Robinhood announced the disabling of their buy button. A few minutes later, it did not appear to work, so I attempted to sell again. Subsequently, my account showed that both ""sells"" went through. Then my account had the cash from both sales, and a negative balance of shares that I was required to deliver in 3 days.

After seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing (without limit), I freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss (\~$180k). If I was lucky and the price went down, I could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain, and could have kept my mouth shut (not that I would have). But instead I'm out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug, and Schwab owes me about $180k.

Had I not covered this erroneous short position, the shorts probably would have become what we know to be ""Failures to Deliver"".

I have attached the record of what happened below, which I sent to Schwab soon after the event, to try to get the situation undone. I eventually was able to call their support team and they said I would have to wait 30 days to resolve the situation.

The guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug, in other equities too. I can't recall the complete conversation.

Anyway, I recently got a message in the system that I would have to wait \*another\* 30 days. So I flipped my shit and now I'm posting about it here. Please don't comment about how retarded I am for investing my retirement in GME. That's not the story. I do what I want, I like the stock, and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded I am, and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on.

I have no information about how many other naked short positions were created by Schwab. I do know that it was more than just myself, and in other equities as well, based on my conversation with their support representative. I have no information about whether or not the bug still exists. I did not test it beyond what happened. It may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem, as far as I know.

Related: I recently posted something that made me suspicious to /r/stocks \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i\_strongly\_suspect\_that\_schwabameritrade\_does\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/)

I didn't realize this until today, but I connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my Schwab retirement account. i.e. Schwab+TD are the same company, and these two things could be related.

Here is the message I sent to Schwab (for a record of what happened). You might notice that it's a 401(k), which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading, but it is a self-managed fund, and individual stocks are actually allowed:

\------------------------------- START OF MESSAGE -----------------------------------

To whom it may concern:

My name is ####### #######, my account number is ####-####

I attempted to call your 1-800 number several times, but I was unable to get through to your support. Here is a breakdown of what happened:

There is a bug in your system that caused my non-margin account to briefly become short GME shares. My account is a non-margin 401(k) account. In good faith, I spent $430k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into. Two trades need to be undone.

At market open, my position this morning was NNNN shares of GME.

At 11:09, I attempted to place a market order to sell NNNN shares: Order #AAAAAAAA

The order did not show up for about 10 minutes. My account balance still showed NNNN shares, so I attempted to make a similar order again. I placed a sell of ""Limit Or Better"" to sell NNNN shares at $125. Order #BBBBBBBB

About 10 minutes later, I got confirmations for BOTH ORDERS, and a notice that the account was due securities. I DO NOT have a margin account, and it should not have gone short, the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account.

Once I realized what the system did, I saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in, and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account, I did a market buy at 11:44AM for NNNN shares using the ""Buy to Cover"" button, which zeroed out my position in GME. Order #CCCCCCCC

The erroneous trade needs to be undone, and my buy to cover also needs to be undone, as both of these are not legal trades for my 401(k).

Orders #BBBBBBBB and #CCCCCCCC should not exist on my account. #BBBBBBBB is a result of a bug in your trading system, and #CCCCCCCC  was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem.

I'm sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened, and I will refer to it when I call again when your call volume is reduced.

civgarth,0.0,2205.0,"Dig through my history. This isn't a self-therapy post after a down week. I've been doing this for a long time.

The reason people fail at this is that their opening trades are way too big for their accounts. And when they are wrong, they are set-back so far that after a string of losing trades, they simply cannot afford to continue.

Let's say I have $1,000,000 in my account. Each trade I open up is rarely above $30,000 to $50,000 dollars or 3% to 5%. And on a $30,000 to $50,000 trade, I'm perfectly happy if I make around $3,000 to $5,000 per trade for the WEEK or even BIWEEKLY! Now that does not seem particularly impressive but if I make 6 trades and 3 of them swing the right way, while the 3 others don't, it's still a pretty good week in terms of absolute dollars. On the 3 where I am wrong, I exit at -3% no matter what happens. This ensures that wins on average are at least 3x bigger than my losses. Also, I only actively trade 15% - 20% of my account. Profits from trades go into long-term positions that I never sell and only add to.

 Now let's say you start with $20,000. This means each trade should really only be about $1,000. So you're thinking, ""What? I can't make a living day trading generating a $100 a week per trade on a good week!!""

No. You can't and you shouldn't. This is why folks should not quit their day job to do this. I didn't quit my day job to do this until 10 years after I started doing this. And here's why.

The professional trader and fund managers are not intrinsically smarter than you. They traditionally had more timely information. That gap has been narrowed with the internet. Where professionals and funds beat you is scale. Here's an exaggerated example. If I can buy 100,000 shares and you can only buy 100, and both of us need $50 today to pay bills, I have virtually no risk whereas you need to hope for a 50% daily return. Most traders who do this at home for income do not make a huge amount of money. I certainly don't. But a large account built over time allows the trader to risk less and less to maintain the same income year over year. Huge funds make shit trades every day. But each trade is less than a fraction of 1% of their book. So stop beating yourself up. The reason you're not doing well is your account is simply too small and you're relying way too much on luck. It takes time and dedication to accumulate enough money. Stop telling yourself you should be further ahead as that thinking will kill you. A lot of you literally started a few months ago. Sometimes you'll have windfalls. Most of the time, trading is boring as shit.

So don't feel bad if you're not getting it right away. You have to tune out the posts where you see people posting wins and losses as that will get you to start gambling instead of trading. A lot of you folks are not 'bad' at this. For some reason, you've just assumed you were 'good' without enough evidence.

Also, I'm not particularly stoic or emotionless on big wins and losses. The long-term positions in my account all got hammered these last few weeks. I will still get pumped or upset and I share with a trading buddy. Find yourself a trading buddy.

TLDR because I am apparently not clear: don't feel bad if you're not successful yet.  You need to get to a decent account size before this starts to click.  

Edit: you guys are nuts and maybe I'm to blame.  I said here is an example.  I even explicitly say I lose half the time.  What on earth did I say that implies I'm a trillionaire?!

Edit: I used perfectly round numbers for examples.  Come on man.  The message is you're struggling because you don't have scale not ""I'm a superstar."" In addition, I didn't start from zero and never implied that I did.

Edit: Holy crap, I even said 'lets say I had..."" to start the example.  The message is about scale and needing time to accumulate.  What on earth are you reading that I'm not seeing?  Y'all need to chill out.  Does it make you feel better to hear me say I also lost a bunch of money on paper this week as well?

There is tons of DD on APHA and TLRY running around reddit, and I trust that you can find it yourselves. There are also ample signs from US politics regarding the upcoming and probable legalization of cannabis. In my opinion, there are some extremely smart ways to invest in the cannabis sector that is projected to grow over the next months/years.

That being said, I am incredibly frustrated that these companies are now seen as pump and dump schemes. I have held positions in both APHA and TLRY for over a month, and I plan on continuing to hold them long-term because I believe in their fundamentals as a company and the expansion of marijuana legalization. PLEASE could everyone stop saying things like ""weed is dead"" and ""I just YOLO'd on weed and sold at the top before it crashed to get my sweet gainz.""

For any seasoned investor, cannabis is a good long-term play right now, and all these meme stock/hypers are giving it a bad name. Leave it alone! Personally, if I were down on these stocks, I would absolutely hold onto them because they have solid potential.

These are not short squeeze/hype/meme stocks. Please stop looking at them as such.

henry_gindt,0.0,1732.0,"While many may argue that value investing doesn't make sense anymore, a lot of the rules and investment principles from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham stand the test of time, especially when you apply current nuance to their original investment rules (which are now close to a century-old)...

**Disclaimer:** The views below represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.

**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**

*“Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.” – quote from Benjamin Graham*

A conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).

Benjamin Graham’s formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold. For instance, if you are 35 years old, you might invest 65% of your investible assets (not including savings) into risky assets like stocks and 35% of your investible assets in less volatile assets like cash (USD/euro or another stable currency) and gold. A 70-year-old, on the other hand, would only invest 30% (rather than 65%) of his or her assets in risky investments (like stocks) and the balance in more stable assets like cash (again, assuming the cash is in US dollar, euros or another relatively stable “low” inflation currency.)

Benjamin Graham formula for proper investment portfolio balance:

100 – your age = risky assets (such as stocks), with the balance in less risky assets

Of note, most of us might categorize real estate investments as safe investments (which may be the case relative to stocks). That said, as Benjamin Graham reminded us over half a century before the 2007-2008 Great Recession, *“Unfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.”* With most financial assets being highly correlated these days due to the high interconnectivity of markets and economies, there are few truly uncorrelated and riskless assets. Real estate prices are as high as ever in 2021 thanks to over a decade of easy monetary policy, along with a dwindling inventory of available homes for sale in the US.

**#2 Have an emergency fund**

*“The unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

We never know when emergencies may strike. We might be fired. Our division at work might be cut. Our spouse or child may experience a significant setback. The 2020 Year from Hell and Covid-19 should remind the world and each of us that disaster can strike at a moment’s notice. We must be prepared for these uncertainties. While volunteering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), a patient once inadvertently taught the author of this piece, Henry Gindt, to “always expect the unexpected.” This particular patient happened to be in the hospital following a heart attack…in his mid-40s…as a marathon runner. (As a side-note, some of the best life lessons and principles can be learned through volunteering. If 2020 taught us anything, it might be that there are plenty of our fellow men and women out there who could use a helping hand. Find a great volunteer opportunity near me.) “Emergencies” happen all the time in life. Oftentimes these emergencies spill over into the financial side of the house. Vanguard Investments suggests as a rule of thumb to maintain at least 3-6 months of income in such an emergency fund in order to cover things like food, mortgage payments/rent, credit card bills, and ongoing health insurance or COBRA in the event of a lost job. This emergency fund should not be invested except in low-risk securities like US Treasuries.

**#3 Choose ETFs over individual stocks**

*“There are two ways to be an intelligent investor: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds; or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Broad market ETFs can curb our emotional impulses to buy and sell to some degree as these broad market index funds are less volatile than most any single individual security. The framework around how we might build an optimal portfolio might be to create balance in your portfolio by 1) conducting ongoing and rigorous homework analyzing stocks (“active investor”) or by selecting a few ETFs and dollar-cost-averaging your investments into these funds over time (see points below). In the Intelligent Investor’s prologue, Warren Buffett reminds us that “What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.”

Step 1 might be to determine a fixed split between risky and less risky assets as part of your investment portfolio (perhaps using Graham’s formula above based on your age).

Step 2 might then be to select a few US and world market ETFs.

This approach might be thought of as setting your portfolio on autopilot as Graham suggests. Some example ETFs offering broad market exposure to US markets include ETFs under the tickers SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) and DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global markets and global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX). These ETFs can be purchased through whichever financial app you use: You Invest (JPMorgan), Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, or any other.

This simple framework may likely do the trick in meeting your financial goals (as well as outperforming any active portfolio management you might pursue). See also how the KISS principle might relate to other areas of your life.

**#4 If you insist on owning individual stocks (active investor) vs. ETFs (passive investor), create a well-balanced and diversified portfolio**

*“Graham’s guideline of owning between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you are not overexposed to one industry.” Quote from Jason Zweig*

If you insist on picking your own stocks vs. using a basket of stocks through ETFs, try to have between 10-30 stocks to get the benefit of good diversification and do not choose all of these stocks from the same industry. A well-balanced portfolio means selecting at least 10 stocks from at least 3 or 4 different industries, according to Graham. For instance, you might balance some investments in high-growth technology sectors with conservative non-cyclical companies that likely pay dividends and have stable growth such as the best healthcare and insurance companies (what some think of as “boring” companies). Experts disagree on how many stocks you must own to have a well-diversified portfolio, but the benefits of diversification tend to experience diminishing marginal benefit as you go over 30 stocks. Additionally, your life becomes increasingly complicated if you are actively managing 30+ stocks. Hedge fund professionals spend 100% of their work time focused on tracking their investments. Do you have time to dedicate 40-60 hours+/ week on researching and monitoring your portfolio? If so, and for advanced investors, including hedge fund traders, you might read Benjamin Graham’s textbook Security Analysis. It is quite amazing how few professional investors on Wall Street and elsewhere have ever read Security Analysis. Graham reminds us that:

*There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.*

**#5 Don’t overpay for stocks (or real-estate investments, cryptocurrency or any other investment)**

*“The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Don’t overpay for stocks just because momentum is good for the moment. In fact, Graham suggested paying an average P/E multiple of 12-13 across an intelligent investor’s portfolio with a maximum P/E of 15 for any individual security. While these P/E ratios are likely overly conservative and represent outdated valuation rules of thumb in the era of pre-rapid technology innovation/adoption and hyper-globalization, one shouldn’t simply ignore a company’s current and future earnings prospects in assigning a value. Benjamin Graham reminds us that “the time everyone decides that a given industry is ‘obviously’ the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks \[or other assets\] have been bid up so high that its future returns have nowhere to go but down.” (See points below on analyzing company fundamentals including both value and growth). If you are investing in some of the latest technology stocks or household name companies like Tesla, Uber, AirBNB, Poshmark, etc., you might notice that the P/E multiple is either non-existent or extremely high. This is because the company is not yet earning much (or any) profit. Instead, the market is valuing the company based on its growth profile which, over time, assuming all goes according to plan, will turn into healthy earnings and profit. However, the second the growth assumptions are tweaked by equity research analysts on Wall St. (or a string of bad news hits the company, its industry or the market overall), the initial rosy valuation assumptions of these high-growth/loss-making companies will swiftly be revised downwards, leading to an almost immediate or rapid decline in value. The collapse in value of your securities and investments will be at least twice as painful as the pleasure from the ride up, according to world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Importantly, never forget that the rosy growth assumptions under which are investing today may experience a sharp reversal when you have ceased actively monitoring these investments months or years later. Even if you choose to become an active investor (rather than a passive investor primarily invested in ETFs), by the time the bad news hits, the damage will already be done due to the rapid price movements following breaking news.

Graham and many other notable investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, billionaire and founder of the investment firm Baupost Group, often speak of creating “margin of safety” when making investments by buying significantly below a company’s intrinsic value. This built-in “pricing buffer” creates some wiggle room and margin for when things don’t work out as planned, as they inevitably do in both financial markets and life more generally. Graham tells us that “If the purchases are made at the average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than average risk of diminished earning power.” In other words, Graham himself speaks to the value of dollar-cost-averaging, where the intelligent investor is consistently buying over time, during good times, as well as during bad times.

The Acorns investment app is an interesting app that can help smooth the average “buy-in price” to avoid concentrating investments when markets are hot and selling when markets are depressed by trickling in investments consistently every day/week/month without any active engagement…over decades. This “dollar-cost-averaging” approach is likely a much better approach for most all of us in the long run, particularly those of us with a few decades to go until retirement. Consider using investment apps like Acorns or talk to your investment advisor about dollar-cost averaging your investments each week or month.  **This is NOT a plug for Acorns specifically - only for the importance of dollar-cost-averaging.

**#6 Focus on the “fundamentals” (earnings and growth) assuming you choose to be an active investor as opposed to a passive investor**

*“Experience has shown that in most cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the assets lose most of their reputed value.” Benjamin Graham*

Companies like Amazon, Google and Apple are now worth over $1 trillion each as their earnings power is so solid and market dominance so secure (for now). In the case of Google, for example, the company prints billions of dollars annually from Google Ads alone. When selecting individual stocks, focus on the earnings power and repeatability of those earnings in a normal year (“normalized earnings”). Also, pay close attention to the company’s growth prospects. Growth is a much more important factor in the 2020s due to the current pace of globalization compared with Benjamin Graham’s era where markets weren’t as interconnected and the United States market offered nearly all the great investment opportunities in his day.

Graham’s formula for selecting growth-oriented companies (as opposed to value-oriented companies below) is Value = Current (Normal) Earnings × (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate), where the annual growth rate can reasonably be expected from the company for at least 7 to 10 years. This formula might be revised to reflect current growth and technology assumptions. However, having some sort of investment formula (which perhaps you develop) as a guide might come in handy as much today as it did in 1949. If you can hold yourself to this investment formula, you might avoid serious mistakes. You might also stress test each of your stock investment ideas (or investment formula) with 2-3 trusted advisers to gain an “outside view.”

For more value-oriented investments, Graham lists 7 key requirements:

1. Adequate size
2. Sufficiently strong financial condition
3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years
4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years
5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings
6. Price of stock no more than 1½ times net asset value
7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
8. In developing your own formula for investing in today’s markets, you might take some example key requirements above and revise them to fit your investment strategy.

**#7 Have patience. (This is hard. Very hard. Extremely hard.)**

*“A defensive investor runs—and wins—the race by sitting still. Patience is the fund investor’s single most powerful ally.” Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

When markets are panicking and you don’t know what to do, do nothing. Panicking only makes matters worse as you try to sell or make other rash decisions. The Intelligent Investor is patient and knows that the best investment holding period is forever, followed by a lifetime, followed by 30 years, followed by 10 years, followed by 3-5 years, followed by at least 1 year in order to reap the capital gains tax benefits (see point below on optimizing taxes). Benjamin Graham reminds us that *“In the financial markets, the worse the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be.”*

**#8 Set rules for when to sell**

*“Reversals \[of fortune\] will have more meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they suggest that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to time, especially if the securities purchased have an apparently excessive advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably priced.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*It may be assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or 30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings.” Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Set rules for when to sell such as after a certain time period has elapsed (say 2-5 years) or profit goal or loss limit has been reached. Instituting rules such as selling all securities at a 30%/50%/100%/3x etc. profit (or at a 10%/30% loss to cap losses) can take some of the emotion out of investing. Make sure whatever specific goal you set when making the investment in a stock(s) or other security aligns with your long-term financial goals. Setting rules on the front-end that align well with your overall long-term financial goals should include setting rules for both downside scenarios and upside scenarios. The best financial and investment apps are pretty good about making it easy to set “stop losses” or sell at a predetermined profit level. We might also be reminded by Benjamin Graham’s most famous student, Warren Buffett, about the two key rules of avoiding loss of principal so that you can stay in the game: #1 Don’t lose money and #2 See rule #1.

Some of the best online trading apps and investment apps include Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, You Invest (JPMorgan), Charles Schwab and Ally Invest. If you don’t have time to do the arduous and consistent research required on the 10-30 stocks in your balanced investment portfolio, a better approach is to use the Acorns app which automates your investments into the most well-known and diversified ETFs from Vanguard.  **If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**

**#9 Don’t chase the latest shining star**

*“What you don’t do is as important to your success as what you do. The lesson is clear: Don’t just do something, stand there. It’s time for everyone to acknowledge that the term ‘long-term investor’ is redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is. Someone who can’t hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Don’t jump on the latest stock or other “hot” investment bandwagon. If the stock is front-page news all over the world and is skyrocketing, it is 9 times out of 10 too late to get onboard for profit. Momentum plays a big role in stock prices in the short term, but over the long run, a company is valued on its earnings and growth trajectory. Oftentimes, technology companies receive such a lofty valuation based on future growth expectations, such as Tesla’s historic rise in 2020. If growth does not end up meeting these expectations, you can expect a company’s publicly traded valuation to decline as quickly as it rose. 

**#10 Ignore “the charts”**

*“If you look at a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge—if only by chance.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

The only metrics you should be focused on are the fundamentals of the company (earning and growth). Many investors these days are fixated on “the charts” such as various moving averages. These are all non-sense. These charts are simply reflections of the latest emotion of an entire market consisting of billions of people reacting to the latest positive or negative news. Ignore these human emotions masquerading as indicators and charts. They will not serve you well in the end. Benjamin Graham refers frequently to the stock market as the emotional and moody “Mr. Market,” which is subject to the daily whims and emotions of…the people trading the stocks on the market. Are there market dislocations and can some investors make money by spotting those temporary market anomalies and market dislocations? Sure. Can they do so repeatedly and consistently over time such that they beat the overall stock market? Many experts think not. In fact, Barrons’ research showed that hedge funds only beat the market by an average of 1.5% annually over the past 20 years. After subtracting the 2% annual fees these investment managers charge the pensions and endowments which are their own investors, they lose money. Think you can beat the average hedge fund manager? Statistically, it’s possible. For a while. Until you don’t. See later points on automating portions (or a substantial amount) of your investments. As humans, we all like crunching data and seeking out patterns. It’s usually not wise in the realm of public markets investing.

**#11 Look for large undervalued companies**

*""The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills. If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will undervalue—relatively, at least—companies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature."" - Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Hunt for true bargains. Graham defines a true bargain as a company that is currently trading at a 50% or more discount from its inherent/intrinsic value. For instance, Facebook was a good example of an interesting investment opportunity for growth at a reasonable price (GARP) during the major market crash in 2020 and when the company made global headlines for it’s privacy issues. See the referenced two major dips on Google Finance here. The global food giant Wal-Mart provides another good example of a value-oriented investment with a healthy long-term dividend. Wal-Mart was trading in the low $80s/ share in 2018 when Amazon was soaring. Check Wal-Mart today. As conventional wisdom goes, markets tend to overcorrect during negative news cycles and overbuy/overpay when the sky is blue, the sun is out and wind behind the sails is plentiful.

**#12 Expect market volatility (and have nerves of steel during this time)**

*“In any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in the next five years.*

*In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.” Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Manage your emotions. If you can’t (like most all of us), read the following two points on micromanaging investments and market volatility. Re-read them. Then, re-read them again. Jason Zweig points to the work of world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose studies have shown that we experience negative emotions and pain from loss twice as intensely as we experience joy and pleasure from gain. This “loss aversion” principle applies not only to financial markets but to many aspects of life. You might check out Daniel Kahneman’s bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow to dig deeper into these psychological forces that influence how we react and behave every day. Markets will inevitably decline, sometimes by as much as 50% or more. Remain focused on the long-run by having nerves of steel. Remember the 2007-2008 Great Recession and the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic and analyze those stock market dips in the context of current market prices. Graham reminds us that:

*For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself. (“The fault, dear \[investor/Brutus\], is not in our stars—\[and not in our stocks\]—but in ourselves….” – William Shakespeare). We have seen much more money made and kept by “ordinary people” who were temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-market lore.*

**#13 Do not micromanage your investments**

*“It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds (less risky) to stocks (more risky) in the investor’s portfolio.”- Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Avoiding micromanaging of investments ties into the point above on keeping emotions in check. You might focus on rebalancing your portfolio between risky and less risky assets 1-2 times/ year rather than choosing new stocks endlessly throughout the year. Graham proposes a rule of thumb for maintaining a split in your portfolio of 100 – your age in risky assets (like stocks) and the balance in less risky assets like treasuries, cash and gold. Spending your time balancing and rebalancing your investment portfolio 1-2 times a year, for instance, is likely far better than readjusting your portfolio daily or weekly, which is a common investment mistake made by the best of us and is largely based on human emotion and current market news and headlines rather than based on sound financial analysis.

Don’t overreact to the headlines. Everyone sees the headline and sells or buys depending on whether the headline was positive or negative. Challenge yourself to take a strong mental note (or better yet keep a log of your notes) and consider the particular headline in light of all the other news and headlines the next time you rebalance your portfolio (at most 1-2x/ year). Ben Graham reminds us that *“most businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies’ performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time. Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.”* In other words, you might take a contrarian approach when looking for interesting market dislocations.

**#14 Automate. Automate. Automate.**

*“It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor’s portfolio.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*“If your investment horizon is long—at least 25 or 30 years—there is only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and whenever else you can spare some money.” Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Choose a financial investment app like Acorns to mechanize and automate the process of investing. If you are starting out investing in your 20s or 30s, you will have plenty of decades for the markets to work for you. You might trickle in however much you can afford in order to make these investments consistently. The beauty of Acorns is you can set up a recurring investment (of say $100 per week) without having to actively remember to invest daily/weekly/monthly. A unique feature of Acorns is that you can link your credit cards so that for every purchase you make, the “purchase amount” is rounded up to the next dollar and instantaneously invested in a broad set of index funds. Further, you can decide whether the funds are invested in broad index funds falling into a conservative, moderate, or aggressive approach, depending on your age and financial goals. Benjamin Graham explains the concept of “dollar-cost-averaging” (the approach used by the financial investment app Acorns), in the following way\*\*:\*\*

*“The third is the device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings.”*

*You might also consider using a personal financial app like Mint from Intuit or Plaid to manage your overall financial goals, which offer tools and features like a personal budget planner, credit monitoring, and “track my spending.”*

**#15 Never forget the reason for investing in the first place**

*“After all, the whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to meet your own needs.” Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Many investors focus on either getting rich or making more money than their peers or simply beating the stock market averages. These investors tend to lose sight of the overall purpose of investing. Focus on your unique goals for investing as it relates to your unique financial situation. Are you trying to meet your and your family’s financial needs for this month or this year? Are you on the verge of retirement? Are you in the prime of your career? Each person’s financial situation is unique because the timing of our financial needs depends on our situation. However, all of us might benefit from reminding ourselves why we invest in the first place. Separate from investing, it’s also worth considering how much of our time we’re willing to trade in order to earn money, oftentimes to buy things we don’t need to impress people we don’t care about impressing in the first place. Time is the most valuable asset for anyone. Invest as much as you can in yourself through ongoing education, learning, and spending time with friends and family. In terms of your financial goals, specifically, see the point above on finding and using one of the best personal finance apps like Mint or Plaid.

**#16 Understand the definition of the phrase “long-term” investments (as well as long-term financial goals)**

*“Psychologists have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the long run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Try to think about the “long-run” in blocks of 10/20/30/50 years from now, depending on your age. The two most glaring examples of “short-term” market disruptions in the context of true “long-term” investments or “long-term” personal or financial goals might be the 2007-2008 Great Recession or the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic (see also WHO). While both crises were undoubtedly severe during the time, markets typically recover within a decade or less. Why is this? If you consider that “the stock market” is simply a marketplace for buying and selling ownership interests in companies and that you can own a small sliver of the US or world economy through broad market ETFs, it might not be surprising that over time there will be growth. The aggregate of companies nearly always grows over time because the global population of people is growing and collectively building and creating new cities, companies, patents, inventions, ideas, etc. Companies routinely collapse and fall out of the various stock market indices while other companies soar. Some recent examples include Tesla being incorporated into the S&amp;P 500 in 2020 on the one hand while GE was delisted from the S&amp;P 500 in 2018 as the last of the original members of the exchange and replaced by Walgreens on the other hand. Walgreens itself may ultimately fall (or be diminished) due to competition from Amazon, which is rolling out a healthcare platform of its own with online pharmacy delivery following the acquisition of PillPack.) You might track how some of the best consumer startups from 2021 or social media 3.0 startups are doing in the year 2030. Some of these companies may appear on the Nasdaq and be household names. Others might be totally forgotten. These concrete examples of market forces represent the most authoritative definition of American capitalism or American innovation. One of Henry Gindt’s colleagues characterized the United States as the largest business incubator the world has ever known.

You can gain exposure to this collective economic growth in the United States through broad market ETFs like SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) or DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX) which all track the collective global stock market and have close to zero fees. Benjamin Graham tells us that “the intelligent investor has no interest in being temporarily right.”

**#17 Tax optimize by holding investments for at least one year to reap benefits of the lower capital gains tax rate**

""*Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."" – Quote from Benjamin Franklin in 1789*

The long-term capital gains tax rate for 2020-2021 is 15% for most single tax filers, but is 0% if annual income is below $80,000 and 20% if annual income is over $441,450. See the IRS page on capital gains for more detail. Aside from incurring high transaction costs from daily (or otherwise frequent) stock trading, when you sell an investment prior to holding that investment for at least one year, your profit will be subject to your typical income tax rate rather than the lower capital gains tax rates above.

Is there anyone out there that thinks that won’t happen?

I can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. 

But we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they’re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they’re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?

Same with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can’t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm).

Hello all,

Before I begin I would like to address something I have been encountering on my posts in the comments section. I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.

I would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.

I also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it's the same regurgitated form of someone else's post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.

This brings me to my first claim. This is **not** over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.

When I say ""it"" I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, ""it"", is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Millions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn't to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.

To examine why it isn't over let's look at both sides of the argument:

1. Bulls claim it's not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won't bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.
2. Bears claim it *is* over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.

I think we can all agree, bear or bull, that *something* happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn't nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.

1. The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.
2. The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.
3. The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.
4. Some combination of the above 3.

**First, the data:**

Based on [morningstar](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.

[Market watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) is showing 41.95%

This spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including ""synthetic longs"" introduced by S3.

It is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. [Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases) for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.

Let's use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:

**The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze**

What's interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn't you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn't be possible/probable.

That would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn't pass the math check. 

**The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.**

Again, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. 

I think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. 

Again, we fall into a ""what-if"" scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.

**The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.**

This scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.

If the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF's losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. 

Sadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it's possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. 

There are way to many what-if's for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can't write it off completely.

**Some combination of the above 3.**

Truthfully, this isn't worth examining just yet. There would be far to many ""what-if's"" to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.

Now, I've heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. ""It's two weeks old"". Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can't pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.

I will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.

Today's data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.

**02/19 -** In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From [here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf) ""The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.""

The exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD's are going to deliver on the same exact day. [This site](https://wherearetheshares.com/), while it isn't an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD's and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.

**02/18 -** Keith Gill aka u/DeepFuckingValue will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don't even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless

**02/24 -** The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won't include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It's possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let's not speculate too much here either, it's just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.

**03/25 -** GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won't even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the ""dying brick and mortar"" narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn't been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop's future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.

I have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes ""just happen"". In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don't even notice it's happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is **rare.**

I hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.

Normally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don't even notice it's happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.

I digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won't happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled [For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), was at the time ""inevitable"" because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.

I want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what's happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.

**SO WHAT DO I THINK**

I think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF's and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let's use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. 

42% is *still* very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren't as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I'm heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. 

How would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn't be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won't be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:

1. Close early and take profits
2. Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don't think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.

In the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn't break $1000.

To break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. 

**NOTE:**  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

**SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END**

My though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:

1. A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.
2. Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air
3. The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. 

It is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren't enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was **not a short squeeze.** However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.

**SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?**

Well, I am long on GME which is why I didn't mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don't plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Beginning of April), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.

Thank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from ""get over it, the squeeze happened"" to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.

Thanks for your time

**WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.**

**TL;DR**: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen's new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline.

mvlli,0.0,1444.0,"Hey ya'll. First and foremost I'm hoping everyone is safe and sound during this time. 

Welcome to the world of trading. I will make this post very simple and straight to the point because newcomers that I am aware of are making me CRINGE by the way they speak and are investing into stocks, not only in this sub, but including people I personally know. 

1. DO NOT spill your life savings into trading.
     You have worked very hard to make that money. The last thing you need is all that money disapearing in a blink of an eye. Start off with an amount you can truly play around with - and do not jump into the get rich quick scheme by dumping everything. Even if it's just $100.00, it's a great amount to get a feel for the market. 
  


2. DD - Due Dilligence 
      This means to investigate on a particular stock you are interested in investing. How so? View their accessible financial records, see how they have performed in the previous years, what situation they are in, etc; That doesn't mean, ""Oh, someone told me Daddy Tesla tweeted about a Woof Woof currency so I'm going to dump my money there.""
Or another example is with people claiming that a certain stock will jump extremely high so ""get in right now!!! 🚀.""
NO. Just no.
I am not saying ALL those individuals are ill-minded or trying to get you, but if you come across something like this, then research ""Pumping and Dumping"". (Quick Answer.
Please, do your own research. I understand everyone wants to make money, especially during this horrific time, but you must do your own part as a trader and not rely or leech of others. Be Smart.  



3. Set a target price and limit for a stock and don't be GREEDY.
     As you see the stock you have invested in is slowly increasing in value, your mouth will get watery. Pretty soon it will get to the point where it gets so high that in an instant it can DROP, causing water to now come out of your eyes. 
I know we want more and more, but especially if you're trading for short term, set a price you would want to sell at. Example:

BAD:
Let us purchase this stock at $0.25, we shall sell at $0.30. Oh wow it's at $0.30, okay let's sell at $0.32, it will surely hit. Ah shit, it hit $0.23 , we have to sell this just so it doesn't go lower.

Set a limit order ! This will automatically sell at the target price you want it to. Once you get your profits, take off and don't look back saying you wish you invested much more and longer if the stock value decides to increase. Be happy! A profit is better than no profit and/or losses!  



4. Educate yourself
     Read up on stocks ! How they work, the meaning of stocks, puts, NASDAQ, ETF's, etc; Familiarize yourself with trading terms. Watch YouTube videos on how to get comfortable with the market, beginner videos on trading, live trading with professionals, etc; Feed yourself knowledge. The more educated you get, the more serene your experience will be within the market.
""Any fool can know. The point is to understand."" ~ Albert Einstein.

5. Handling losses. 
     If you are losing a substantial amount of money from what you have deposited and it is affecting you mentally, physically or is causing you to be in a depressive state you can't escape, then you shouldn't be trading anymore. You have to learn to handle losses. Every trader goes through a loss or failure as so does every human being excluding trading.  It was your idea to get into trading, so you should be aware of risk consequences.
Learn to enjoy the whole journey man regardless of what happens. Have fun every step of the way and don't let certain things get to you. I've had my losses in the market and I am glad to say it hasn't bothered me one bit. Life is meant to be enjoyed, not to be lived with sadness. 

Best of luck to all of us traders and I wish you nothing but success for this brand new year and the years to come.

_bono983,0.0,1347.0,"""Tesla finished below $600 for the first time since Dec. 4, and has lost 15% on the year.

The sell-off comes amidst a bigger drawback in tech stocks, which are valued based on the presumption of heavy growth in future cash flows.

Competition and parts shortages are also playing a part.

Shares in Tesla were down as much as 8% Friday morning. They’ve since recovered to finish down -3.78% as markets showed a dramatic bounceback late on Friday, but the stock has still lost more than 15% of its value the year, and finished below $600 for the first time since Dec. 4.

FED FEARS 

On Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that “upward pressure on prices” and “transitory increases in inflation” might be coming to the U.S. as the economy reopens following a year of Covid restrictions that hit businesses across the board.

The market is now worried that interest rates will climb, and the feds won’t take aggressive policy actions or even be able to control it. Bond yields are surging.

This is causing a broader correction in tech stocks, which are valued based on the presumption of heavy growth in future cash flows. As inflation goes up, the value of those future cash flows declines. As CNBC previously reported, the Nasdaq 100 list of the largest 100 non-financial stocks on the exchange, is down about 8% from historic highs reached three weeks ago.
This is affecting most tech giants. For instance, Apple dropped from approximately $129 to $121 year-to-date, and Netflix has dropped from around $523 to $516. But Tesla’s drop is more precipitous, so far.

Bulls acknowledge competition

Some of Tesla’s biggest and most vocal backers have cashed out a chunk of their shares, and begun to acknowledge the onslaught of electric vehicle competition as a real challenge to Tesla at long last.

For example, Ron Baron sold 1.7 million worth of Tesla shares and invested in two of the company’s biggest potential rivals, GM-owned Cruise and Amazon-backed Rivian, while paradoxically saying he expects Tesla shares to rise, eventually, to $2,000.
Former Tesla board member Steve Westly said on CNBC’s Power Lunch this week that while he remains bullish, “Tesla is not going to be king of the hill in electric forever.” He added, “They’re getting competition from all sectors. They’re going to have to double down to compete.”
Indeed, automakers including Ford and Volkswagen have seen early success with sales of their electric vehicles including the Mach E and ID.3 up against Tesla models in the US and Europe.
Meanwhile, forthcoming EV’s, including the all electric version of Ford’s F-150, the Lucid Air, Rivian’s electric SUVs and trucks, and others are stirring excitement. Just yesterday, Porsche showed off the production version of its Taycan Cross Turismo, and said it would start sales in the US this summer. It’s a $90,000 EV wagon, a more affordable, practical take on Porsche’s performance EV, the Taycan.


Part shortages

Semiconductor shortages have caused most auto makers to temporarily close some lines at their factories, and Tesla is no exception.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the company’s Fremont, California, plant shut down temporarily due to “parts shortages” in a tweet on February 25. He said it was shut down for just two days, but did not make clear whether partial shut-downs on some lines would continue.
Tesla had previously warned, in its Q4 2020 earnings call and filing, that chip shortages could hamper their vehicle production goals in the first half of 2021.
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said on the call with investors, that for the first quarter of 2021:
″[Model] S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly re-architected products. Additionally, we are working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage as well as port capacity which may have a temporary impact.”
If Tesla does not produce a high volume of vehicles, due to parts shortages or lag times shipping parts from overseas to its U.S. plants, the company would not generate as many regulatory credits that it wants to. Tesla sells these environmental credits to other automakers, which is how it has historically achieved profitability.


Steeper expenses

Controlling costs has been on CEO Elon Musk’s mind on and off for years.
In December 2020, he wrote in e-mail to all Tesla employees: “Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that’s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!”
But at the same time, Tesla is on an expansion tear that will cost it handsomely. The EV maker is building factories in Austin, Texas, in Brandenburg, Germany and expanding its footprint in China. It has also embarked on revamping aspects of its Fremont facilities, including the paint shop, the area of the factory where its cars are painted.
Musk also has ambitions for Tesla to mine its own lithium, domestically. And to ramp up production of Tesla’s own battery cells at a pilot plant also in Fremont.
Besides these efforts, the company is in the midst of costly recalls and could face more-- whether voluntary or mandatory. Most significantly of these voluntary recalls, in China and in the US, Tesla is recalling Model S and X vehicles experiencing touchscreen display failures.""

Gary0915,0.0,1274.0,"So many analysts have been saying lately that the market is heavily over-valued amid the pandemic and is due for a crash or major correction at least. In all honesty, they themselves are not sure what's going to happen and are simply rolling the dice, hoping that the outcome will be in their favor so that they will be given astounding credit in the media just in the case the market does fall, which it won't.

The government is printing more money in a matter of days than it has in 10 YEARS. Money supply has gone up so fast and the market is going up an insane amount for the same reason, accounting for the huge deflation in the value of the currency. I hate these analysts with every fiber of my being because they think that they can time the market, but they know deep inside, that they are wrong and are misguiding everyone. This can't be compared to the 2008 crisis because the fed and government are doing everything they can to support the ETFs by not only printing more money but also putting in policies to make this a fail-proof market. Why don't people understand that the government is printing money so that normal retails investors keep pumping money back into the market? This was all part of the corrupt government plan. The stimulus check is meant to save people who don't have jobs, but the government is literally giving it out to the people who DON'T need it. I know so many people who have enough wealth but still got the stimulus check. Guess where they put the check? INTO THE STOCK MARKET!!! The only way for the stock market to go is up. If you still don't believe me, keep waiting and missing out. This is the best and safest hedge against inflation.

As always, the poor people that don't invest NOW will be left out in the big game of investing and later on realize the grave mistake they put themselves in. The rich people always benefit and the stock market is living proof of that.

vacalicious,0.0,1238.0,"Dips like today are a natural, healthy part of the stock market. The market never goes up in a straight line. It zigzags, selling off when stocks climb too high too fast — and when the market contains too much froth and speculation — which creates buying opportunities as prices fall. 

I know: Looking at your portfolio on red days is difficult. So don’t! Do not look at how much you’re down in one day, or in individual positions. That data will only deject you. Rather, scroll down to the stocks you want to buy. Skip the painful part and go directly to the deals.

And remember: all signs point to this market recovering from here, and then reaching over 4000SPX in the relatively near future. Most end-of-year projections from Wall Street have the S&amp;P finishing 2021 around 4300-4500. That’s quite the yearly gain! We want to be in this market long-term, as vaccines roll out and the economy recovers and booms.

So how to buy the dip?

You should have a list of stocks you’re watching. Either these are stocks you want to own, or current positions you want to increase. Determine what entry point you want to buy. And keep an eye on our market support levels, which are 3850SPX-3775. Purchase a little bit at your price — or at support — to make sure you at least start a position, in case this dip is on the shorter side. From there, buy in tranches on the way down. Never buy all at once. Buy a little bit during the morning, afternoon and before the closing bell, to make sure you get a range of prices, including whatever turns out to be the best.

And always assume the dip might last another day or so. Save some money for future, deeper selloffs in the days ahead, as the market goes through the volatile motions of a healthy selloff. Just as the market never goes straight up, it also zigzags on the way down. Give yourself the opportunity to buy over the course of several days. 

Buy the dip, and then thank yourself in the weeks and months ahead as these positions push into the green. That’s what’s worked for me. Do the bulk of your buying when other people are selling.

You can see that the stock market goes up and up and up until it can't take it anymore -- then it goes down. But when it goes down -- unless something really bad happens -- it always goes down to either the middle line or the bottom line, then it bounces right back up again.

If you want to invest, you should take the time to read John Bogle’s “little book of common sense investing” to understand why ETFs always beat 90%+ of investment strategies. Also everyone should read Benjamin Graham’s “Intelligent Investor”. If you don’t have time, why would you think you have time to invest?

The distilled version is that the market always broadly goes up in the long term, buying and holding a diversified s&amp;p500 ETF with very low fees (like VOO) is the surest way to guarantee your fair share of returns. Almost everyone on this sub would have better returns over 30 years if they did nothing but that. But of course, that isn’t fun for people.

But know this—the market will come down from here. It is trading well above value. If your money is disproportionately in individual stocks, you have no guarantee of it coming back.

If you’re new to investing out at least 90% of your money in VOO and leave it alone. Forever. The rest you can take shots at individual stocks with. When you add money to your portfolio, add at least 50% to VOO and then with the left over you can buy individual stocks. Do this for AT LEAST a year, but 3 would be better.

If you’re experienced you don’t need me to tell you this but 60% of yours portfolio should still be in ETFs.

Good luck out there. I don’t know when it will come down, but it will.

EDIT: after some people calling me a “boomer” and questioning my selection, I’ll provide disclosures. It’s true that I do not own only ETFs. But I have been investing for a lot while. A bit over 60% of my portfolio is in ETFs or holding companies (BRKB)

nmercado1986,0.0,1084.0,"Again, same herd mentality in WSB. The same echo chamber phenomenon. 

Yes, some sort of delta squeezing happened yesterday. Lots of nice DD posts out there.

Still, we could perhaps guess that on 02/26 those call options might be squozen.

Or... it could not happen.

We don't know the delta on those calls, maybe they sold them real cheap when GME was at 200, just to hedge. We also don't know if they are covered or naked calls.

It's clear that redditors money is not moving the needle and that the spike was caused either by covering shorts or call options being delta-hedged. In any case, don't be reassured by other people buying. Accept a squeeze like yesterday's can happen, but **it's completely out of your control or other redditors'. So TRADE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.**

Right now WSB is *again* showcasing posts of people putting their life savings on GME near the top, and **not a single comment with a hard, concise, word of caution.**

It's just sad at this point. 

**I've got my 2 shares in**. Idgaf, I can hold. **But I might just as well sell at 150, 200, 300** and buy something nice for a member of my family with the free cash. Realize that is the case with a lot of people.

There might be the possibilty of a historical squeeze and 10k, 50k, blah blah. But it's a possibility. It's not worth your life savings and your loved ones wellbeing. What if there still is a lot to squeeze yet, but funds keep repeating the cycle of bringing the price down for weeks? Are these people putting their entire savings in GME going to hold until then? No. They will panic and cash out with a loss.

1.	Get ideas for stocks to &lt;research yourself&gt;.
2.	Engage socially with people that share your interest in investing. For example, i have no people in my real life circle that even know what stocks are. So i use reddit to engage socially with likeminded individuals.

graiz,0.0,1036.0,"I've been trading about 20 years and while I'm ""not a financial advisor"" there are a lot of basics that people just aren't doing.

The influx of investors jumping into GameStop has been fun for some, painful for others.  I'm going to outline some best practices for making money in the market year over year.

**1.  Never invest in something that you don't understand.**  
GME was the latest example but I've seen people do the same thing with Calls, Puts, Shorts and other more exotic trading mechanics. If you don't understand something don't invest in it... assume that there's someone who does understand it and will trade on their deeper knowledge.

**2.  Trade in the long-term.**  
Your ideal positions will be in companies where you're betting on their 3-5 year trajectory.  The markets have a ton of daily/monthly volatility but if you're taking a longer-term view, you'll have many more wins than losses.  Long-term trading is also far more favorable in terms of taxes.  This can give you an instant 20-30% advantage over a swing/day-trader.   Translation...  You're not gaining or losing money every day... you only gain or lose when you sell. Your potential is going up or down but it's just potential.

**3.  Care about the companies you're investing in.**  
Investing is both a way to make money but it's also a way to support companies that you believe in.  It's more fun to own a stock of a company that's doing something great than simply a company you think is trending on reddit. It also incentivizes you to read their financials, their news releases and makes you knowledgable for when to sell if you start seeing long-term trends that don't look good.  I love talking about the products of the stocks I own because I tend to like them both.

**4.  Do your research.**  
If you're going to own an individual stocks then do your research.  Ideally in a field or area that's tied to something you already know a lot about.  Some people know a lot about sports, others know a lot about travel, or science, or cars.  Lean into the sectors that you're interested in and do your research.  Each sector has winners and if you're deeper in one sector, you'll be more capable of spotting winners.

**5.  Zoom in and Out of the Chart**  
Stocks tend to follow macro-trends.  If you're buying or selling you need to understand the last few years to get a sense of what is likely to happen.  Companies tend to have inertia. If they lift 10% yearly, they have some inertia to keep doing that.  If they stay flat or go down... they have inertia to continue. Look for changes that can alter that trajectory. If you can spot these inflection points, there's a lot of potential to outperform.   Sometimes these inflection points are external (COVID/Election) sometimes they are internal (new CEO, new product, new direction), your research of the sector (4) can often give you an advantage when thinking long-term (1) over people who are zoomed in. Remember to think long-term.

**6.  Don't invest money that you can't afford to lose it.**  
If you invest stocks long enough you'll have bad days... really bad days but that's part of the market. If it stresses you out... Don't do it. That being said, a disciplined and long term investing approach can give you a lot of financial freedom... and it can be a lot of fun.

ilai_reddead,0.0,954.0," I was very interested in finding the rhetoric and overall feel of the dot com bubble so I searched by date before 2000 and here what I found.

""**Not long ago I asked the officer of a regional investment banking firm why the price-earnings ratio for a small publicly held company was so high. “After all,” I said, “this company has the potential to grow since it’s in the dental equipment industry. It seems to me it warrants a high ratio.” Don’t you know,” my friend replied, somewhat puzzled, “that that company is mainly a machine shop? That puts it into a low-growth industry classification.”** this is so eerily similar to tesla, not only does the guy say a p/e ratio is obsolete when it's not, but he also tries to make an argument that a dental shop is not a low growth industry when it is, very similar to how people say Tesla isn't a car company and price it differently because of that.

another interesting quote that I found was

**""It was once the job of analysts to tell investors at what price a stock should trade. But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots, even when it comes to big stocks with predictable earnings growth. Sure, the fine art of rationalizing high stock prices has long been on display for tiny, unproven Internet ventures without earnings. After all, it's hard to value a new company using traditional methods when it has no earnings.""** even after reading this I still could be fooled that this was written today, the way he says that traditional metrics don't matter or don't work anymore is strikingly similar, also the phrase ""**But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots""** is also ringing some bells in my head after this whole retail revolution.

and the final one I have is also the most striking

**""For day traders armed with Power E\*trade accounts and limitless optimism, the Internet is a revolution that has blown away all the old rules about how the stock market works.""** this is just so striking to what I hear today, replace e-trade with Robin and boom I would say this was written right now. and also how they say all of the old rules are obsolete the next paragraph also very eerie ""**For more seasoned investors, however, the Internet rally looks suspiciously like a beast they've seen rear its head time and again in an overripe bull market: a stock market bubble, fed by young, greedy investors for whom a 20% annual return on investments is a mark of defeat."".** this is almost an exact repeat of the dot com bubble, I never thought it was this similar but wow, I think I will begin to hedge my portfolio and I would caution against saying this times is different.

moneytobemade8,0.0,933.0,"I have seen many people not buy stocks due to the price being too high or vice versa. I have also seen many people think that stocks will go up a lot because the price is ""relatively"" cheap and has room to grow. For example, I recently read a Reddit Post where the author said that they believe TSM will easily go to a price of $500-600. However, the market cap is already 591 billion meaning they expect they will be more valuable than Amazon or Apple. I am not saying this is not true, but market cap is extremely important to take into consideration.

Apple's current price is $121.26 and Enphase's price is $176.06. Does this mean Enphase is the more valuable company? No. 

A company with a smaller cap has more room to grow than companies with bigger market caps regardless of the price they trade at. For example, it is more feasible that a 1 billion dollar company grows 10X than a company with a market cap of 50 billion to grow to 500 billion.

sfjetsetter,0.0,778.0,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. (This post has a lot of sources but in order to push this through I've had to remove most of the link, you can pm me for sources if you'd like)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist. Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is covering using synthetic long shares or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started withreading SEC Regulation SHO which deals with naked short selling. “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**.

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**""

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**.

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"".

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when RHood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at RHood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between RHoodand Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of RHoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to RHood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars. So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.”

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.”

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**.

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”**

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122%
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a Redditor brought up: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**",stocks,Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,778.0,0.92
ShubhamG77,0.0,786.0,"The following is my summary of Cathie Wood’s thoughts on recent market volatility, as presented in her latest video on the Ark Invest YouTube channel (\~42 min) – I strongly recommend you check it out.

The minimum expected rate of return for a stock to enter an ark portfolio is 15% CAGR. Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.

She mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&amp;p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs “are a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.”

She reiterates that “we are not in a bubble” – and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as “creative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&amp;p500”.

To Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that ‘real growth is going to pick up’ – and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn’t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.

Rotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where ‘too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon’. Energy and financial sectors booming will likely be short lived as they are both ripe for massive disruption.",stocks,“We are not in a bubble” – Cathie Wood,786.0,0.86

#The criteria

**1. general selection**

I invested some of my capital in companies operating in the hydrogen sector in 2017. Now that most positions here have increased tenfold, I'm looking at sectors that have the same potential. Besides EVs, there is really only one sector that impresses me similarly: biotech and nanotech. 
I have taken a closer look at 140 companies operating under the biotech and nanotech category. Here I would like to summarise which ones are particularly interesting and why. I have also focused on favouring unknown companies in order to fully exploit their potential. Conversely, this means that I do not include BioNTech or CureVac in this DD, even though they are certainly very solid companies. 

**2. penny stocks**

During my research I also came across some very interesting pennystocks, but due to the rules of the subreddit they cannot be included.

**3. the evaluation criteria**

As evaluation criteria of the companies, I then added the field in which the company is active and the techniques used by the company. 

Of course, personal impressions should not be the deciding factor. (But it must always be taken into account. A pure assessment based on the figures would be value investing, and we don't want to do value investing here, but look at the real opportunities.) But the numbers still play a role. Many of the companies in research have outlays before patents on drugs or therapies can be applied for and money can be earned. So I have also looked at the financial reports of every company I present here. According to the sector, my focus was not on whether the company is in the black or not, but whether losses have been reduced compared to the previous year's figures or not. 

#These are the stocks I like

Out of the 140 companies, I ended up buying shares in eight companies. Of these, two are a penny stock and one has a market cap of only 718M. (I can't shed more light on these because of this subs rules).

However, five interesting companies remain that I would like to present in more detail. (Sorted by their market cap)

**1. Wuxi Biologics**

WXIBF 

Market Cap: 66.763B

Wuxi Biologics is a Chinese headquartered CDMO that provides open-access, integrated technology platforms for biologics drug development. This company is not really active in one area of application, but is in some ways an all-rounder. It develops software that is used for research and cooperates with many companies to market this software but also to produce drugs for countless areas of application. In the process, the company has seven subsidiaries in China, three in the USA, two in Germany and one in Ireland. 

About the numbers:

Wuxi Biologics had revenues of $1,607B in the first half of 2019. In the first half of 2020, that increased by 21% to 1,944B USD. While profit was 671M USD in the first half of 2019 and 787.3M USD in the first half of 2020. Wuxi Biologics has made a revenue increase of 64.4% and a profit increase of 68.2% since 2014.

Conclusion:

Judging by its broad-based operations, big-name collaborations with companies worldwide and good numbers, Wuxi Biologics is a profitable company, which is very rare to find in the biotech segment. Accordingly, it is also by far the most highly valued. However, because it is such a large company that has its own software for developing new solutions in medicine, sells this software and is also involved in the production of drugs, it is difficult for me not to see growth potential here. You have a company that covers all the desirable sectors itself and is so very unique.

**2. Denali Therapeutics**

DNLI

Market Cap: 9.229B

The company focuses on the discovery and development of therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS and others. Denali's approach here is to find a way to solve these diseases via genetics, pathology and cell biology. In the process, the company has found 22 drugs, four of which are currently in clinical trials. 

About the numbers:

DNLI had revenue of $8.41M in the first half of 2019, rising slightly to $9.45M in the first half of 2020. The loss per share remains steadily at a similar level. It will remain that way for the time being. Until the first therapies complete clinical trials and are approved. -$0.51 USD EPS is not unusual in the biotech sector precisely because of the horrendous research costs.

Conclusion:

DNLI has had incredible success in discovering therapeutic approaches and drugs. Even if the approval rate is only one quarter, there will be a huge potential over the years if the research success remains the same. And all of this in fields in which there are currently only partially successful therapeutic approaches.

**3. Exelixis**

EXEL

Market Cap: 7.387B

Exelixis is a company that makes genomics-based drugs for cancer. They already have an approved anti-cancer drug, Cometriq. The company is currently involved in 50 clinical trials and currently has four other anti-cancer therapies in the pipeline. The company has years of experience in the field and is listed on the S&amp;P 400. If research in genetic engineering increases in the coming years, you have a company that is well positioned in this field. 

About the numbers: 

In the first half of 2019, revenue was $455.77M. In the first half of 2020, it was 486.38M USD. So, the company shows a small growth. What is noteworthy here is that Exelixis is in the black because of the drugs they have already approved. They were able to turn losses into profits in 2016 and have been cash flow positive ever since. 

Conclusion:

Exelixis reinvests a lot of their money back into research and still remains profitable despite large reinvestments. From the list, this company is probably the most conservative with the least risk of loss. An already profitable company that is listed on the S&amp;P 400, but still has huge growth potential as it has a wide head start with genomics expertise.

**4. MorphoSys**

MOR

Market Cap: 3.759B

MorphoSys develops biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the Company focuses not only on drug discovery itself, but also on the technologies and intelligent development strategies themselves. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Similar to the former candidate on this list, MorphoSys is therefore a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion. 

About the numbers:

MorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020. 

Conclusion:

If this trend continues, MorphoSys is currently an undervalued company. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys has proprietary software that it combines with research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune diseases in addition to cancer. From the list of companies I selected, this is definitely my favorite, along with a penny stock that is not mentioned in this subreddit.

**5. NantKwest**

NK

Market Cap: 2.914B

NantKwest is a company that focuses on the treatment of cancer and a few other diseases. Of note here is that NantKwest is taking a unique approach that I have not seen in any other of the 140 biotech companies. NantKwest has built its own cell-based platform through which they can introduce genetic material into cancer cells or cells affected by infections. The company itself calls it ""Natural killer cells: the quest toward a cure."" It's an approach that is so impressive and, according to the clinical studies, works well. So we are talking about vaccines. Of the 13 therapeutic approaches the company has in the pipeline, 5 are in clinical trials. The cancer vaccine approach is just too interesting for me to pass over this company.

About the numbers:

NantKwest, as mentioned several times now, has negative EPS common in biotech. However, since 2016, EPS has improved from -1.47 USD to -0.7 USD in 2019. Revenue increased from $12K in the first half of 2019 to $30K in the first half of 2020. These are by far the smallest numbers and this is certainly where hope for the company's approach lies behind the large market cap.

Conclusion:

A vaccine against cancer would be incredible. NantKwest's cells are already being tested and the potential seems to be there. The company could have a promising future, but remains (at least of the companies on the list with a market cap over $1B) the riskiest investment method. Which, however, is in a company with a really great approach that I just like.

Stock 3:  40%return year 1, -20% return year 2

Stock 4:  120% return year 1, -100% return year 2

Stock 3: $100 turns into $140 turns into $112 for a total profit of $12

Stock 4: $100 turns into $220 turns into $0. And you are done. 


All four stocks have the same average annual return of 10%.  But the more volatile stock has much higher volatility drag that reduces overall profit. In the extreme case you lose your shirt. There is a formula for it: Expected return over a long period of time is mu minus sigma squared divided by 2, where mu is mean and sigma is standard deviation. 

The reason I am writing this - someone asked a question: “Why not invest in triple-leveraged Nasdaq ETF?  Yes it will go up and down a lot but it’s long term average return will be triple the regular Nasdaq.”  Well, yes, it will, but volatility drag will be huge as well and will drag down your expected return over time.

EDIT:  There seems to be misunderstanding what “Average Annual Return” means. It means your high school’s “add bunch of numbers and divide by n”- that is arithmetic average. “Compounded Annual Return” is geometric average and means what you think it should mean.  When you guys see “Average Annual Return” anywhere - newspapers, tv shows, etc - they are using the idiotic arithmetic average.  So don’t fall for it. It doesn’t account for volatility. Here are definitions:

Compounded Annual Return

The compounded annual return is the rate of return on your investment taking into consideration the compounding effect of the investment for each year. This is a much more accurate measure of performance than the average annual return.

Average Annual Return

Average annual return is the return realized when you divide the cumulative return on the investment by the number of years.

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.

&gt; * B/itcoin — which topped $52,000 this week — hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a “highly speculative asset.”

*****

&gt; # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus

&gt; * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. “The price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,” she said.” We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.” Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.

*****

&gt; # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid

&gt; * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.

&gt; * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer’s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.

*****

&gt; # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK’s top court rules drivers are workers

&gt; * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company’s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an “agency” that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees.

*****

&gt; # 5. Citadel’s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice

&gt; * During Thursday’s GameStop hearing, Citadel’s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about “payment for order flow,” a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. “I do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,” Griffin added.

**16th November, it rallied 11% from the 30th October**

**If you'd invested on 2nd September, it would've taken you till November 13th to go green again.**

Now that's just the S&amp;P500, I can't say for EV and Tech stocks on their own but the point still stands. Think why you've invested in the stocks you've chosen. Have you just gone off random advice on reddit without doing DD, or do you see a bright future for your companies?

Yes, **the market is overvalued,** yes there's warning signs of a crash, people panicking, media stirring it up, but the reality is no one knows what's going to happen next. **All you can do is judge your situation based on your own circumstances.**

If you've lost a lot of money recently in your portfolio **you have two options, realise your losses and accept it and learn from it, or wait a few months or years and hope that your portfolio recovers**. The option you choose depends on when you need your money, and how risky your stocks are and how much you can afford to lose. People love to see the upside of things but rarely factor in the downside. **This is your downside, you need to judge how much more of it you can take.**

If you've found it incredibly stressful watching your portfolio be in the red, maybe you need to **reevaluate whether investing is for you or the kind of investing you're doing or educate yourself on how to invest better,** there's lots of free resources out there to learn about analyzing stocks, what metrics to look at, etc.

**If you're a beginner investor, keep it simple**, don't just jump on the bandwagon or make trades you don't fully understand. You need some sort of system to follow to take your emotions out of the equation as much as possible.

It's easier said than done but I'd urge everyone to **be careful, leveraged trading, shorting and not diversifying are all surefire ways to land yourself in trouble.**

Do I think the stock market is about to crash or begin a long term bear market? No I don't but no one can be 100% certain. If there is a crash, it's likely that things will rally soon after. If you're scared to lose more than you can afford, then maybe cut some of your losses but if you can afford to wait and you believe in the stocks you've chosen then sit tight and it will all be alright.

Motional is backed by Hyundai, and coincidentally Hyundai just announced they will NOT be partnering with Apple for a self driving car. Could it be because they got meaningful progress on their own assets and don’t need Apple? Yes, this is just my speculation, but it’s big fucking news for BB.

The technology enables Motional to provide safe data communication exchange within the vehicles safety system. Motional is expected to roll out self driving cars by 2023.

Here is another [article](https://techspective.net/2021/02/01/qualcomm-google-and-blackberry-the-companies-revolutionizing-the-automobile/) that highlights why BB could be picked up by other EV plays. The highlight being:

“Blackberry has the most secure high-volume operating system on the planet, with QNX, which is being used on car operations... The Blackberry-Google part of this effort is rather interesting because while each potentially plays on both the control and the car’s entertainment side, they are best when working together. QNX leads with security and experience with embedded systems. Still, it doesn’t have much in terms of app support, which is a plus when you talk about the systems that drive, control, and stop the car, but a minus if you are talking about cockpit entertainment. Google’s Android platform has a ton of apps and developer support, making it less secure and more likely to get hacked, tolerable for the entertainment systems in a car but unacceptable for anything to do with car safety. Working in tandem, Working together, Blackberry secures the result, ensuring the car is reliable and safe.

BB timeline in the past 3 months: Partners with Amazon. Partners with Baidu (The Chinese Google). Partners with Motional (EV). Don’t be deterred by the fluctuation due to the panic selling from the meme stock halt, this is fucking taking off again and this time it will stick without the bullshit.

TLDR: Always do what you feel is right for yourself and only invest within your means/ risk tolerance because I am not a financial advisor. My bias opinion is pick up some BB before you miss the fucking rocket. CEO Chen even [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20) out some hints of the events to come.

Keep in mind that it has multiple sources giving BB a target price of $25-$30 that were given BEFORE the partnership with Motional. Recently Zack’s upgraded stock to a “#2 Strong buy” with a target of 29.00, and Motley also ranked it a #1 buy with a target price of 30.00. [Yahoo Finance](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-keep-143027800.html) also looking bullish.

rhetorical_twix,0.0,649.0,"[Finviz heat map of market 02/19](https://imgur.com/VZAXcd7)

Stock indexes go red for a reason, and you should always be alert when it does. The market sell-off on Tuesday to Thursday was concentrated in recent high-growth stocks, across all market capitalizations. What I started to see on Thursday was a flight to value. What happened on Friday was a rotation of capital from pandemic stocks to small cap and mid cap stocks. 

On Friday, as the Finviz heat map shows, we saw a sell-off in 2020's growth stocks (i.e. mega cap tech, health care and consumer defensive stocks).

The other thing the Finviz heat map shows is another move of capital into small caps and mid caps as investors take profits from large and mega caps that were pumped up by the pandemic and build more distributed portfolios. I.e. people are building new portfolios for 2021's that move away from pandemic stocks.

This is important information to pay attention to. Which is why, in my opinion, you don't ignore Red days, or complain about people you think are naive or inexperienced investors when they sit up and start asking questions or selling stocks they think have topped out to buy new stocks that they think are better going forward. 

If you're not ready to take information that the Red days offer us, and update/rebalance your portfolio going forward based on that information, you're going to miss out on signals that the environment may be changing. And then you might get stuck in diminishing returns as the market moves in a different direction than the portfolio you're sitting in serves best. 

IMO, the action last week suggests people who are going to sit in a 2020-inspired pandemic portfolio for all of 2021 will probably see diminishing returns. 

The rotations into small and mid caps, and also from mega cap growth to value, have been taking place from time to time since the November election, and it seems to be an accelerating trend. Last week also saw a big drop in gold prices at the same time as a stiff uptick in consumer interest rates, which indicates a move away from pandemic safe havens, into higher interest and higher yield investments. The selling of gold into a consumer interest rate hike also suggests the move to value investing in the latter half of last week isn't just noise, because gold is also a hedge against inflation and has tended to go up during times of climbing interest rates. 

So everyone who is bashing Red day alarmists in threads where you talk about how you got big gains in 2020 for doing nothing but investing in Apple type stocks, buying in at the March bottom or riding SPY for 100% gains, if you're not updating your portfolio for 2021 right now, you're probably underperforming the market as these sector and market cap rotations occur. 

For me, last week was the week where I disengaged from a lot of EV sector investments, leaving only a few percent of my portfolio in them. And I was ready to catch the small and mid cap industrial bounce on Friday, which was a big green day for me even tho the indices were flat. 

Personally, I expect these trends to small cap, mid cap and value stocks to continue throughout the Spring and I expect the money for those gains will continue to come from the mega cap tech stocks and pandemic portfolio positions that people/institutional investors are are taking profits from. 

The Red days raise alarms that something is happening and that something is sometimes a change in direction. So I see the rotation out of mega cap and large cap pandemic plays and into small cap, mid cap and value + growth stocks is a trend that is firming up. 

That trend is probably going to become very significant by the end of the quarter, in March, when institutional and professional investors have to rebalance their portfolios across asset classes, take profits and cut bloated positions. The shift in interest rates and asset class rotations is a significant change in investing environment. If you're still sitting in passive index ETFs or pandemic stocks, you may want to start preparing for a rebalance, too. 

There will probably be more Red days like this one, particularly toward the end of March. So for many who are still sitting in pandemic portfolios, you might have a Red March if you don't start revisiting your holdings in February.",stocks,"This is why you pay attention to Red Days (because it's healthy to notice when market rotations occur) (Heat map of Friday, 02/19)",649.0,0.93
AjaxFC1900,0.0,654.0,"Elon Musk revealed that he has heard that Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA), and he might have lost a lot of money on it.


 
Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

Stocks staged a remarkable rally Monday as the market celebrated another effective coronavirus vaccine and Treasury yields stabilized. Each of the major indexes gained more than 2% today after suffering one of the worst weeks since October. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \[economic\] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. 

Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March.

In Washington DC, over the weekend, the House of Representatives advanced the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package without any Republican support. The bill includes an additional payment of $1,400 to Americans, $400 per week in augmented Federal unemployment benefits, and $350 billion in State, local, and tribal aid. The bill now heads to the Senate, with lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before the mid-March deadline when current Federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. 

The Democrats are employing a process called reconciliation in order to get the stimulus bill passed without Republican support. Through reconciliation, Congress can enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. As a reminder, there is a 50/50 split in the Senate, but Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Vice-President, has the power to break a tie.

* I’m a physician
* Patients love their medication, berotralstat (Orladeyo), because they don’t need to self-inject
* Orladeyo costs $500k a year and it’s being approved by insurance companies
* That means $BCRX undervalued by an order of 10X on this drug alone — ($121 vs. current price of $10)

A few weeks ago I read a fantastic post by u/thisismysffpcaccount: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xiqh/bcrx\_the\_most\_undervalued\_stock\_in\_the\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xiqh/bcrx_the_most_undervalued_stock_in_the_market/) on $BCRX

The summary is that $BCRX created a new drug, Orladeyo, which to treat hereditary angioedema (HAE). There’s about 10,750 HAE patients in the U.S. alone.

Let me take a pause to mention that having HAE fucking sucks. People get massive swelling pretty much completely randomly, including in their airway (bad — can’t breathe) or their gut (bad — vomiting, can’t eat). The treatment fucking sucks, which is basically getting C1 inhibitor from donor blood administered IV (or more commonly fresh frozen plasma which contains C1 inhibitors). As you might imagine this is incredibly fucking disruptive to their life.

So given the fresh DD on $BCRX, I thought to myself, “the parts of my brain used for numbers are smooth because I just memorized everything like they said to in medical school, but here’s something I can get real insight into!”

I spoke with a few of my colleagues in Hematology who mentioned that they’ve had tons of patients switch from Haegarda (requires injection) and Cinryze (requires injection) to Orladeyo (just an oral pill). Patients hate self-injecting medications. Many of them are queasy, or you have to get a family member to help you, and it reminds you that you’re chronically sick. We have patients who go to the emergency room over and over again because we can’t convince them to start on new medications. All of these patients have been started on Orladeyo and have since avoided the ER, saving society tons of money.

(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc and the New York Stock Exchange have each sued the Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to block a plan by the regulator to overhaul public data feeds that broadcast stock prices to investors, court filings show.

Under the SEC plan, approved in December, supply and demand data for stocks would be added to public feeds, broadening access to the information which the exchanges currently sell to professional traders at a premium.

“Nasdaq believes the SEC exceeded its authority by adopting an ill-considered remake of market structure,” a Nasdaq spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. The plan “would make equity markets overly complex and increase hidden costs for investors”, the statement said.

The filings were made in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Of Columbia Circuit.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Cboe Global Markets, which operates the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was also suing the SEC over the issue. Cboe did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action taken by the exchanges against the SEC in recent years, which include a successful challenge to a proposed experiment by the SEC to cap trading fees on 1,400 different stocks.

The SEC is also dealing with other suits. In October, Citadel Securities sued the commission over its decision to approve a new mechanism for trading stocks at exchange operator IEX Group Inc.

Relevations,0.0,612.0,"Imagine you are faced with two buttons that you can press, and you can only press one:

**Button A: You have a 50% chance to win $10,000**

**Button B: You have a .00000001% Chance to win $10,000,000**

What is the better option? Well probably Button A, but let's turn to basic probability theory to be precise. Treating it as an expected value problem, we find:

Button A: $10,000 * .5 = $5,000

Button B: $10,000,000 * .00000001% = $.001

Button A is the better choice 100% of the time. If you were given the option, you'd probably press button A.

However, imagine a world where you, making the right choice, chose button A and lost the 50/50 chance and didn't even win the $10,000. Then, someone steps up right after you, and after thinking for a bit, presses button B thinking it's the better choice.

**He wins.**

Well I'm here to tell you that as a fellow button A presser, you don't suck, and I'm proud of you.

New investors - you are constantly being tempted to buy into this results oriented-thinking. The thinking that because the *result* was good you made the right decision.

There has obviously been a large influx of new investors flooding to reddit and heading straight to the markets themselves. Some of you are high off your recent gains and are looking for more, others are feeling discouraged after a streak of bad losses.

Maverick_WC,0.0,575.0,"Disclaimer: I am not predicting a crash or a correction, but am merely stating my opinion IF it does happen. 

The premise of buying and holding is that you are buying companies with good fundamentals and poised for continued growth in future. I have seen a lot of people on many posts saying that ‘they have done they DD’ which honestly is probably 30 mins on checking Reddit and Stocktwits for bullish sentiments instead of really downloading and reading the company’s financial records, future growth prospects etc. 

I think it is a good time to evaluate if your stock can handle a huge drop in price and still allows you to have conviction to keep holding. A lot of stocks are down 20-30%+ or more from their ATHs at this point, and if a crash or correction does happen (I believe NASDAQ is at or very near correction territory at about -10% from ATH), it’s going to see one crazy drop of -10-30% in a single day just like what happened in March. 

Can you handle it? If you can, the stock is a conviction pick for you. If not, perhaps consider buying something that you have truly done DD in. I have certain holdings that I believe to be dangerous when a correction or crash comes, like NIO, NET and JD (NET and JD have a growing consumer base and they will continue to grow, but at current market cap I deem it to be dangerous. NIO is super dangerous but it’s house money at this point since I got in at 15$ and sold more than half at 44$ long ago) But I got them at prices low enough to be able to withstand it even if they dropped more, they are a smaller % of my portfolio and I am willing to risk a loss for a more aggressive approach. 

I also have holdings which I will definitely add more if a crash does happen,like MWK and DIS. Tech is never going to be irrelevant after Covid, the transition to value stocks is temporary and it’s clear to me, so I am still ever so bullish on tech stocks and e-commerce. 

It’s obvious no one can be unaffected when you see your NLV drop, and that much is the same for me. However, at the end of the day, if this stock is something viable for years, buy and hold works, if it was a one time hype, reconsider your approach. I never got into green energy stocks because they are either mostly unprofitable or have no working product. Climate change and all is real, but it takes a lot of time to get there. Oil is still going to be a huge deal for decades regardless and I am quite tired of people having done ‘DD’ in some holdings that do not make any sense. 

Part of my holdings are aggressive,which makes it more volatile during a market correction. But ALL of my holdings are at least generating revenue and have a product that is being sold that I personally find to be indicative of what they are accomplish in future. I can never ever buy into a company that makes no revenue and I can only respect the balls of people who buys into such companies because they have strong belief that the company will be successful in that venture. If they buy at a point when the company is still in development, they definitely deserve a much better % in profits. I can never do that personally myself because I am not that ballsy.

The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel is a GREAT book that was released last year and talks about handling your money in the stock market. Please read it if you can, great book, has definitely helped me to manage my emotions in the stock market. No one loves taking a beating everyday, but some things are worth holding on to. 

I was there during march and all my holdings took a minimally 27% (I remember this number specifically because I was counting numbers that day) dive in a single day, I never sold and we recovered. It is great to buy and hold, statistics and numbers shows that it beats timing the market, but if only works if the company isn’t some overhyped unicorn crap. Please stay safe everyone and I hope for this to turn positive soon like everyone does. Ultimately, you invest in consideration for your family (especially those married and with kids), so do not put money that you cannot afford to lose.

Sukh6,0.0,569.0,"As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY. *Following is a deep dive into that partnership* in anticipation of the AWS and IVY webinar on Feb 23rd 2PM EST.

Ivy benefits the whole value-chain

* IVY enables **automakers** to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. **AKA feed** **OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable**.
* The **developers** won’t need specialized or automotive software skills.

Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.

* The **consumer (driver)** gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data

Data is the new Gold/Oil

BB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy “By the way this project, we’ve **been working with Amazon** has taken us probably about **2 years**..we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, **obviously not as elaborative as today**..”.

He goes on to say that this **creates a recuring data business for BB**. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckensey&amp;Co report outlined (see my summary) connected cars (the new iPhone) will **allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars**. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

**Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:**

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)
2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things

Per Frost &amp; Sulliven report, a comprehensive endpoint-based security platform should be able to protect against 97% of cyberthreats (attacks). Per F&amp;S, BB can currently protect up to 96% of all cyberthreats **and secure ALL IoTs endpoints.** Possible endpoints (Cars, Phones, Computers, Smart-Appliances, Drones, Smart cities, etc). Its easy to see why Amazon would partner with BB, as another reddit user pointed out, Drones being the most interesting one. By the way, John Chen also mentions Drones in a different interview.

**What does Amazon provide BB:**

1. AWS experience with user interfaces
2. AWS Cloud
3. Machine learning models from AWS Management Console

Competition

Chen points out that he is not worried about **Apple and Google** entering the space as they also only have experience with user interfaces and **lack experience in the OEM space with the ecosystems**.

Another important distinction is that **Ivy allows** OEMs to “own their customer,” Google/Apple may not allow that to happen as they want to own the data. **“BB is only transporting the data”** **to the OEMs**. If you’re an OEM and you understand the value of data, would you choose an OS that lets you own the data or an OS that keeps it for itself..

BB really has a unique opportunity in front of them, the **automotive space is rapidly changing** and 2023-2025 is going to look a lot different than it does now. BB already is in 175 million cars and 61% of the EV market already use QNX. Side note, Lucid motors is also using QNX, they are currently hiring a QNX developer for what that is worth. Let’s hope BB executes, I trust that under John Chen’s leadership BB will.

Let's say you are someone like me who scrolls through hoping to find that amazing DD that is going to be the next big thing and rocket you right to the moon... You think you're staying on top of things by reading the posts end-to-end and finding opportunities that really make sense. You get really excited about opportunities with awesome DD but for one glaring issue....timing.

The unfortunate reality is that this DD you found is only likely to get up-voted and become visible to you, after the stock has ALREADY popped. When the stock pops people get excited and they share it out...but it's always coming AFTER the pop. 

So, if your objective is to make a quick profit, you're setting yourself up for failure. Sure, you might get lucky, and you might still make a profit long-term, but your timing in the short-term will always be sub-optimal.

Now...I'm not knocking good DD as a way to find opportunities, but you should update your thinking and maybe taking the following steps instead of buying willy-nilly:

1. After you see some sexy DD, check if the stock is already spiking
2. If the stock is already spiking...then WATCH it...don't BUY it

They give errors for any attempt to put limit sells higher than this. Why are they treating GME limit sells differently from Google? I have a cash account. There should be no share lending going on. The broker should not be at risk for ANY limit I put on the sale of my shares.

1) TD allows Google (and many other stocks) limit sell orders to be placed at about 50x the price.

2) GME limit sell orders can be placed at only about 5x the price.

WATERLOO, ON, Feb. 18, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced enhancements to its BlackBerry Radar® H2 intelligent, data-driven asset monitoring devices to help the world's transportation businesses reduce costs and securely improve the utilization of their trailers, containers, chassis and other remote assets.

With the intermodal industry facing an unprecedented capacity crunch and fleets waiting for months on end to receive a new trailer due to manufacturing bottlenecks, timely and accurate data that can shed light on where a fleet manager's assets and drivers are, and how effectively they are being utilized, has never been more important.

With multi-sensor reporting, the enhanced BlackBerry Radar H2 device expands on the core capabilities of the original to improve global coverage and connectivity to the latest 4G LTE cellular networks and bands. The company also bolstered the short-range wireless communications protocol for connecting to sensors, adding range and stability and improving compliance with worldwide standards.  

New BlackBerry Radar R2

To support global operations that need enhanced cargo visibility and control of their shipments, BlackBerry also released the BlackBerry Radar R2, a unique wireless sensor that uses radar waves to measures cube space utilization inside a container or trailer, with the door open or closed.     

""As countries struggle to ensure critical healthcare supplies and essential goods make it to market amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain efficiency and security have never been more important,"" said Christopher Plaat, SVP and GM, BlackBerry Radar. ""With the new global enhancements to our BlackBerry Radar H2 devices, transportation and logistics businesses the world over can unlock excess shipping capacity they didn't know they had and gain better visibility into their entire fleet, both of which are vital during these unprecedented times when transport companies' role as the lifeblood of our economy is heightened.""

Select trucking companies and private fleet operators are currently participating in a customer pilot program to trial the new enhancements that have been made to the BlackBerry Radar H2. BlackBerry Radar devices are currently operating around the world including in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America and North America, respectively.

New Events 2.0 Alerting System

The online end user dashboard has also been enhanced, empowering teams to better manage their assets based on the information BlackBerry Radar provides. The new Events 2.0 Alerting System highlights 'events' within a customer's transportation ecosystem that are important to their specific business needs, systematically combing through mounds of asset location and status data to bring forward actionable intelligence to help solve problems and drive operational efficiencies. With Events 2.0, transportation businesses can create custom reporting dashboards using a combination of data elements – mileage, cargo status, location, geofence, asset type, asset status and time frame – to focus on key items of importance that can be monitored for, acted against and improved upon, whether it be turn times, preventative maintenance, or unauthorized and underutilized assets.

BlackBerry Radar is an innovative, easy-to-install, asset monitoring solution that provides information such as location, motion, mileage, temperature, humidity, door open/close status, and cargo status on an intuitive on-line dashboard. It collects significantly more data than conventional GPS-based track and trace solutions and uses this information to build a 360-degree visualization of a customer's assets. All data is transmitted and stored securely on a cloud platform, which maintains the privacy of user information at all times.

hooman_or_whatever,0.0,523.0,"It has become exceeding clear that a lot of new investors, and even some seasoned ones have overlooked some crucial aspects regarding finance as a whole. I am beginning a tutorial series on YT and here, starting with finance and working our way up to investing/trading tools and strategies. Welcome to the first one.

A large portion of individuals understand what money is but few know what we are supposed to be doing with it. Today we are going to discuss the 4 buckets of finance.

**Short, Mid, Long, Retirement**

The purpose, asset classes, advantages and disadvantages of each will be discussed.

**Short-Term Bucket**

*Purpose:* It is meant to be 3-6 months worth of expenses that you have saved away. It should never exceed more than 6 months as your money in a savings account is actually losing value over time. It is meant to fund short term things such as your car breaking down, we can call this the emergency fund.  It is also a safety net, for instance, if you were to lose your job then you are sure you have 6 months to find a new one. This is perhaps the most important bucket to investors and I will explain why later.

*Asset Classes:* Cash, Checking, Savings, Money Market Accounts

*Advantages:* It is liquid meaning you can withdraw at any time, and it is safe as the money is insured and secured. More than that, it keeps peace of mind. This is why it is so important to investors; one of the largest risks while investing is emotion, with a full short term bucket you will not fall prey to emotion as much as you would if this was all of your funds.

*Disadvantages:* Low returns, typically less than 2%. Now, keep in mind, inflation averages 2-3% and therefore outpaces your returns de-valuing your money over time. This money is also fully taxable. These are reasons why it should never exceed the 6 months worth of expenses mark. All additional funds beyond your emergency fund should be moved to other buckets to grow exponentially, outpace inflation, and increase your net-worth.

**Mid-Term Bucket**

*Purpose:* It is meant to fund mid-term goals such as purchasing a home, paying for college, investing in a company. This is where most people on Reddit are currently operating and where too many are being their financial journey.

*Asset Classes:* Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF's

*Advantages:* Contrary to popular belief 7-8% is the target goal for growth. If you are able to pull off 20% or higher annual returns, then good on you. If you have a separate fund that's available for high-risk investments akin to gambling, this is how you could see 1000%+ returns. Another advantage is that its relatively liquid, meaning you could sell off securities to retrieve your money at anytime. However, it is *relatively* liquid because if they market is moving against you then you would have to sell at a loss, or even if the market is in a bull run you wouldn't want to pull out until you're closer to the top.

*Disadvantages:* First and foremost; risk. Not only are you subject to market risk, but that market risk is controlled by global socioeconomic factors that could be impossible to predict. The way people react to these things is based on emotion. So emotional risk isn't only your own, personal emotion, but the emotion of everyone else in the market. Your personal emotion could be curbed by having a full short term bucket. Gains are taxable...by quite a bit. [Here is a calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) so you can see for yourself. Finally, there are some serious barriers to entry regarding FUD (Fear. Uncertainty. Doubt) and knowledge. I am hoping that this tutorial series could help alleviate some of that concern.

**Long-Term Bucket**

*Purpose:* This is meant to diversify and hedge against market risk. This bucket requires some serious capital and should be started after seeing some success in your mid-term bucket. Albeit, some individuals will purchase homes prior to investing but I don't think jumping right into real-estate is always the wisest financial decision.

*Asset Classes:* Real estate, small business, cash value life insurance, fixed annuities

*Advantages:* Relatively safe, several tax benefits, and it creates generational wealth; meaning these are things that could stay within your family line. The returns are typically 4-5% in this bucket. They aren't meant to outpace inflation by a terrible sum, but enough to diversify your wealth and secure tangible assets.

*Disadvantages:* This bucket is probably out of many's reach right now due to the capital requirements. Even still, it is not a bucket I am focused on due to this significant disadvantage: your capital is tied up in the short term. I am personally not at a place where I want my capital tied up, all of it is in the midterm bucket until I have reached my financial goals and am ready to move on.

**Retirement Bucket**

*Purpose:* Well...to retire. I'm sure many of you are familiar with this bucket but a lot of younger folks (myself included) seem to have forgotten that we will one day need to rely on funds in order to survive. We don't put enough emphasis on this bucket earlier on in life.

*Asset Classes:* Roth 401k, 401k, Roth IRA, IRA, Variable Annuity

*Advantages:* A large advantage to this bucket is the tax advantage. Depending on which direction you go, you could end up with tax-deferred or even tax-free growth. Because the market generally trends upward, this also means on a long enough horizon you will see larger returns. The biggest benefit and the prime reason I utilize this bucket is the 401k company match. To turn that down is equivalent to denying free money.

*Disadvantages:* You cannot forget that this is still the market, so you are still held to similar disadvantages as the mid-term bucket. The market could move against you and market or independent emotion could play a factor as well. Another disadvantage is that it is virtually illiquid, while you are able to take your money out you will be hit with a pretty severe penalty. This in conjunction with personal emotion could add up to serious financial disaster. The final disadvantage is that annual contributions are capped. IRA's are capped at $6000 and 401k's are capped at $19,500. Even if you have the wealth to fully commit to both of these for 60 straight years that would equate to roughly $1.5M (of course not including the returns)

**Summary:**

I truthfully don't believe anyone should even consider investing until they have their short term bucket full. It will make you a better investor by helping mitigate emotional response and will also provide peace of mind to allow you to practice patience in the market. On the other side, for those who have filled their short-term bucket and continue adding to their savings account, you are quite literally throwing money away and should consider at least one, if not all, of these follow-on buckets.

The tutorial series will be focused heavily on the mid-term bucket, primarily regarding stocks. This bucket is single handedly the largest creator of wealth in the entire world.

The long term bucket is a fantastic way to give peace of mind, diversify your wealth, and create generational wealth for your family and legacy. However, the capital requirements and short term lockup makes this something we won't focus on in the series until a much later date. I hope that myself and you will be considering adding to this bucket at the same time and we could open a new series on this bucket specifically.

The retirement bucket isn't something that should be ignored but should be getting added to gradually over a long timeline. Truthfully, I expect to retire from the mid-term bucket, however, I am adding to this bucket solely due to the 401k match by my employers.

**TL;DR:** Before you begin investing, or even if you have and don't really know what you should do with this money, you should consider learning a bit about finance first. As we continue to crowd source and share information, I hope this generation to exhibit enough knowledge, perseverance, and grit to create a real shift in wealth distribution. Follow me for the tutorials to come. I look forward to your thoughts and questions.

dal2k305,0.0,505.0,"Do to recent events there has been a large influx of new investors and traders. All these new people is a good thing for the market. More people= more money in the market which is good for all of us. But due to this new growth of investors a lot of the new people don’t understand certain strategies and are being misled by other selfish investors into making huge mistakes.

Bringing your cost basis down is a strategy that a lot of investors use when they buy into a stock that sells off after. Generally you will see this when someone makes a large purchase leading up to an earnings report or some news event and things don’t pan out. The stock sells off 10% and they buy the dip to bring their cost basis down. This only works when the company you’re investing in is strong financially and fundamentally and when the macro conditions are conducive for a bull market.

Why doesn’t this apply to the lot of meme stocks that exploded last month? Because their value was never based on anything financial or fundamental. What I am seeing now is people lowering their cost basis based on cosmetic appearance alone. $300 costs basis looks much worse than $100 costs basis when the stock is trading at $50 right ??? Wrong! it really comes down to how many shares you own for example:
Investor A buys 1 share of GME at $300 and the stock is currently trading at $50 their costs basis is $300 and they’re down $250. Investor B purchased 1 share at $300 and then 10 shares at $200 and another 10 shares at $100. Their cost basis is $157 but since they own 21 shares and the share price is $50 they’re down $2,247. 

Investor B has a much lower cost basis ($157) than investor A  ($300) but is down a lot more money ($2247 vs $300) When you chase after a parabolic stock that is not tied to fundamentals or finances and it eventually crashes you’re not supposed to buy the dip. This is called trying to catch a falling knife. Buying the dip is a fundamentals play, it’s a belief in the companies long term prospects and finances. What happened last month was the opposite of fundamentals.

TLDR lowering your costs basis “averaging down”
Is dangerous with the wrong stock. It is a fundamentals play and cannot be applied to the non-fundamental moves in meme stocks last month. Don’t try and catch the falling knife.",stocks,Averaging down is dangerous with the wrong stock. Catching the falling knife.,505.0,0.9

You know that they are good and will perform well in the long term. 

Short term volatility doesn’t matter in the long term. I’ve heard many successful CEOs like Bezos talk about how he doesn’t care about the volatility in the short term. And in my opinion, this is a very important thing to remember during times when there is a lot of short term volatility.

I think selling is necessary only if something really negative is happening within the company or the sector. If it’s just healthy market behaviour, you shouldn’t be worried.

This quote by Benjamin Graham, the author of the Intelligent Investor is really good and should be remembered always.

”In the short term, the market is voting machnie, but in the long term the market is a weighing machine.”

Here's a simple question: **What is a stock worth right now and why?**

There's lots of ways to answer this question, many (revenue multiples, earnings multiples, etc) are short hand or simplified ways of describing the same thing.

The foundation of modern finance answers this with: **The Present Value of all Future Cash Flows**

Regardless of whether you're talking about equity in a growth tech company, a value oriented utilities operator, or even a distressed oil company, the answer can be broken down further into two components or sets of assumptions:

1. What are those future cash flows this company will produce for this equity share I'm buying?
2. What discount do I give them to calculate their value today?

# Future Cash Flows:

The first component I imagine everyone is conceptually super familiar with. Everyone see's headlines about revenue growth or earnings growth and some kind of % figure that gets them excited. So when it comes to the value of equity, which do we care about?

The answer here is less commonly thrown around. The cash flows we calculate into for an equity valuation are the **Free Cash Flow to Equity**, or **FCFE.**

In short, **FCFE** is how much cash is available to all shareholders **AFTER** all expenses, reinvestment, and debts have been paid. A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.

So how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.

`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`

Thankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.

So this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our ""Terminal Value"" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:

`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`

Now there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.

Now that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?

# Discount Rates:

This is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.

Let's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).

So how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of ""buying the thing that gives you those cash flows"" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.

So how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:

`FV = PV (1+r)^t`

That is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:

`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`

We already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **""HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?""**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.

What the fuck is ""**cost of equity**"" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as ""costs"" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \[mentor of Fischer Black\], William Sharpe \[known for the Sharpe Ratio\], and Merton Miller \[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's ""cost"" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what ""cost"" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:

`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`

R(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the ""cost"" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.

Rrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.

B is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?

And finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.

Let's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.

`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`

That's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.

This finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.

# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)

I'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.

For a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.

First things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \[insert s word thing that shall not be named\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).

&amp;#x200B;

||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|
|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|

Now we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion

At first glance impressions are easy to be ""holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!"". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our ""What is this worth today?"" question.

So for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.

Continuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:

Rrfr: 1.0%

Beta: 2.0

ERP: 10%

Using these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.

So using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.21)^(8)|= 1 / (1.21)^(9)|= 1 / (1.21)^(10)|= 1 / (1.21)^(11)|= 1 / (1.21)^(12)|= 1 / (1.21)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.22|0.18|0.15|0.12|0.10|0.08|
|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|

The sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.

But that's not all.

Now let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.

Our cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|
|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|

With just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.

I'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain. In a nutshell that folks, is the power of compounding and why small shifts in a seemingly benign rate can shift massive changes in values for these growth stocks that are primarily basing their value on cash flows happening 10-15 years from now.",stocks,PSA: Why Treasury Rates matter for your Fundamental Equity Valuations,497.0,0.95

_bono983,0.0,422.0,"""Tesla and  founder Elon Musk are renowned for notching firsts. In 2012, the EV-maker unveiled the first-ever premium all-electric sedan, the Model S. Six years later, Musk’s SpaceX launched the world’s most powerful rocket, the Falcon Heavy. That milestone marked another first, since the Falcon carried the Tesla Roadster into space, making the pioneering EV the first auto ever to orbit the Earth.

Recently, Musk has set supersonic financial records. Tesla’s moonshot from a market cap of $30 billion in mid-April of last year to $849 billion on Jan. 26 dwarfs the leap of any other young comer on the rise in a nine-month span. By early January, Tesla’s rise had lifted Musk’s net worth to $185 billion, placing the Tesla founder on a new pedestal as the world’s richest person.

Musk just achieved a new financial first––for the stock losing the most value ever in a brief period. Since that late January peak, Tesla’s valuation has cratered by 36%, dropping by $305 billion to $544 billion at mid-morning on March 5, as its shares tumbled from $883 to $566. No company in the annals of equity markets has ever dropped on a scale remotely that big in just five and a half weeks. Tesla’s $300 billion–plus descent exceeds the market caps of all but the 16 most valuable companies in the S&amp;P 500. Tesla dropped by far more than twice the combined market caps of Ford and General Motors, and by $100 billion more than that of the world’s second most valuable automaker, Toyota.

It may reassure Tesla bulls that it’s been a highly volatile stock in the past: It has seen big drops and then always recovered to shoot beyond previous peaks. From mid-February to mid-March of last year, it shed half its value and in the first two weeks of September, fell 34%, only to roar back on both occasions. The September slump shaved $186 billion from its valuation, but Tesla got it all back, and $400 billion more in the months ahead. Sure, you’ll hear, Tesla will suffer big bumps along the way, but its long-term trajectory will trace a sharp upward climb.
Still, the 34% decline means that Tesla’s shares need to rebound 56% to regain their old peak of $883 (and valuation of $849 billion). Overnight, investors decided that Tesla will earn a lot less than they foresaw as recently as late January.

What’s driving Tesla’s big pullback?

Let’s assume shareholders will want at least a 10% annual return in exchange for what can be counted on as a wild ride. To get there as of late January, Tesla needed to be worth $2.2 trillion by early 2031. At a premium price-to-earnings multiple of 30, Tesla would be generating $73 billion in yearly GAAP net earnings. That’s $5 billion more than Apple, by far the biggest profit spinner in the S&amp;P, made last year.

Now, shareholders have lowered the bar––but that bar remains dauntingly high. Using the same formula, the bogey is now $1.44 trillion 10 years from now, and earnings would need to reach $48 billion. To get there, Tesla’s 2020 profits of $721 million have to grow at an annual pace of around 50%.
That Tesla suffered such a huge fall, so fast, highlights the extreme uncertainty in assessing what it’s really worth. In reality, investors have little or no idea how much Tesla will earn in the future. Will the number be $60 billion in 2031 or $10 billion, something lower than that or something in between? Making any reasonable estimate requires so many assumptions that the exercise is futile. What remains is a super-sexy product, a charismatic CEO, a cult following, and a great narrative. What also remains is a still-giant valuation that can only go higher if great numbers start coming in, and fast. Otherwise, Tesla is sitting on an air pocket whose deflation would set new records unlikely ever to be equaled.""

This is my short and condensed KISS (keep it stupid simple) review of ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd ($ASX). The basics covers some of the fundamentals, with the figures benchmarked against ASE Technology’s largest indirect competitor - TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited) - as indicated by ‘vs.’. Keep in mind that ASE is not a manufacturer of semiconductors. They specialize in assembly and testing, which happens in the final stages of production. TSMC specializes in the early stages of semiconductor production as a manufacturer. They are however both key players in the same industry. Why am I using TSMC as a benchmark instead of comparing against industry averages? Because you don’t benchmark against ‘average’, you benchmark against the top performers in the same industry. The points made inside the bearish and bullish arguments are my interpretations of the company and stock. The summary is my attempt of bringing everything together. I invite you to totally destroy my DD with your best arguments so we can further debug the analysis on this stock. Let’s go!

## Bearish Arguments

* Europe wants to develop its own chip industry. Taiwan can expect competition if Europe pushes through \[17\].
* ASE’s debt to equity ratio is much higher than the industry average and that of their competitor TSMC \[14\]\[15\]\[16\].
* Both TSMC and ASE serve high-profile customer Apple. However, TSMC holds bigger contracts as they have a larger footprint in Apple’s supply chain \[23\].
* There has been a 65.78% growth in shorts within a single month as reported in Jan 29 this year \[18\].
* Not a lot of big money signals. Low institutional ownership of stock \[6\].
* 4 yr growth in total liabilities grew 114% vs. 4 yr growth in total assets that grew 60.4% \[12\].

## Bullish Arguments

* ASE Technology has tailored its applications to increase their stake in growth markets such as smart cities, smart homes, smart cars/bikes, and smart factories (Industry 4.0) \[24\].
* In late 2020, they established the first 5G mmWave smart factory \[25\].
* Their plan for the future, as announced in the annual shareholders meeting late 2020, points towards an expansion into providing tailored solutions in markets such as medicine and transport, where AI, IoT, and AIoT will play a more significant role \[21\].
* Their sustainability practices and principles have resulted in several awards, such as the double A listing for Global Climate and Water Stewardship \[22\].
* ASE has experienced significant growth in revenue and net income. They’re now up by 43% compared to 3 years ago \[12\].
* Very low PE and P/B (price to book value) ratio in comparison to industry leader TSMC \[2\]\[3\]\[10\]\[11\].
* ASE also beats TSMC on short % of shares outstanding, 3 month price returns, and earnings growth - in significant ways \[4\]\[5\]\[8\]\[9\]\[12\]\[13\].
* ASE provides semiconductor assembly and testing services for over 90 percent of electronics companies in the world \[26\].
* In 2020, the Taiwanese economy has outpaced China for the first time in 30 years \[19\].
* Analyst average recommendation rating is 1.5 (between Buy and Strong Buy) \[20\].

## Summary

ASE Technology has a significant stake in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and although they face serious competition, they’ve adapted quite well and are moving towards a leadership role in industry innovation. It’s a growth company, in a growth market, in a growth country. Do they need insanely huge contracts from the likes of Apple? No, and their current growth confirms it as they provide their services to over 90% of electronics companies in the world. In fact, some argue that it’s dangerous to be heavily dependent on a single customer. That being said, their debt to equity ratio is high. Much higher than the industry average. Is this by definition a bad thing? Not necessarily. It might have even scared off some institutional investors, which is fine by me because it means less volatility. But perhaps it's less of a good sign for those who need big money signals.

ASE decided to take on quite some debt. It’s risky for sure but not at a point where there’s red flags. It's not unusual in the manufacturing/assembly industry but it definitely is an aggressive approach. It could be a calculated risk where the current projected revenue for this year will more than cover their debt if reached \[20\]. They will need to make optimal use of their cash flow, which has been steadily growing. Will they reach the projections? I’m of the opinion that they will based on their current growth patterns as well as the tech industry’s move towards more integrated solutions, which ASE is betting on. 

When the car industry experienced a massive chip shortage and companies like ASE were running at full capacity, it became clear to me that this shortage would function as a catalyst that will further prepare and propel Taiwanese semiconductor production to handle higher demand in the future. European leaders like Merkel and Macron are pushing for Europe to develop its own chip industry. But how likely is it that major consumers of chips will go through the trial and errors in Europe, at a high cost, rather than to deal with their trusted suppliers who are innovating as we speak? Perhaps I’m underestimating (or overestimating) matters but when I weigh the bullish and bearish arguments against each other, I can see no valid reason why ASE’s stock is currently so undervalued. I personally like the company's ethics, milestones, growth, and plans for the future.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021.

# **Stocks face the crosscurrents of higher interest rates and fiscal stimulus in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/stocks-face-the-crosscurrents-of-higher-interest-rates-and-fiscal-stimulus-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Covid-19 aid package is on track for final congressional approval in the week ahead — and it could be a double-edged sword for markets.
*****
&gt; The legislation should be greeted by optimism around the powerful lift it could give the stock market and the economy, but it could also be met with concern about what a historically large stimulus package could do to inflation and interest rates.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 higher, but the Nasdaq was dragged lower by interest rate-sensitive tech names. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to press higher, revisiting its recent high of 1.61% on Friday, before trading at 1.54% in late trading. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; One wild card for stocks could be how interest rates behave around upcoming Treasury auctions.
*****
&gt; There is a $38 billion 10-year auction on Wednesday and a $24 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Traders are watching these closely, after a historically weak 7-year Treasury note auction in February sent rates higher, even for the 10-year.
*****
&gt; “We’re a little more cautious on them, just given what we saw in the 7-year and some Japanese selling pressure,” said Ben Jeffery, strategist on the U.S. rates strategy team at BMO Capital Markets.
*****
&gt; He said Japanese institutions could be less interested in participating before the end of their fiscal year on March 31.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus coming
The Senate was expected to approve its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package and send it to the House for a vote during the week. Otherwise, the market is watching key inflation reports with the consumer price index expected Wednesday and the producer price index, scheduled for Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think the markets will be watching closely the progress on the stimulus package,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I think they’ll continue to watch the 10-year Treasury move and we’re going to get CPI data. That’s going to inform on those moves.”
*****
&gt; He expects stimulus to remain a factor that could sway markets.
*****
&gt; Inflation has been a worry for markets, since rising inflation could crush margins and corrode earnings power. For bond investors, it would erode value and make interest payments worth less.
*****
&gt; “As long as the rise in Treasury yields matches the pick-up in inflation, I think the market will be able to handle that. I think the challenge is when yields get notably above inflation...I like to see them closely matched,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; He said the market is concerned that the next stimulus package could overheat the economy and create inflation, particularly as it comes on the heels of the package approved in December.
*****
&gt; “I think it lends to the conversation, ‘do you really need another $1.9 trillion?’ Arone said. “We’re going to pour more gas on the fire, and with this $1.9 trillion that’s what the market is concerned about.”
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation is expected to remain somewhat muted for February, after the 1.4% rise year-over-year in core CPI in January. But the pace of inflation is likely to pick up notably in March and April, since the comparisons to last year, when the economy was shut down, will likely look extreme.
*****
&gt; # Choppy to continue
&gt; Strategists expect the push-pull between interest rates and stocks to continue.
*****
&gt; On Friday, rates were higher after a strong February jobs report and stocks were also higher. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, about 160,000 more than expected.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think 1.5%, 1.6% on the 10-year is terribly troublesome for the market,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She said the speed of the move was troubling.
*****
&gt; The rotation out of tech and growth into more cyclical names in the financial, energy and industrial sectors continued in the past week.
*****
&gt; Energy was up more than 10% with oil prices, which were at a near two-year high. Financials saw the next strongest move, gaining 4.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re in a choppy consolidation phase,” said Sonders.
*****
&gt; “You’re seeing some extreme historical spreads between what energy and financials are doing recently versus tech and consumer discretionary,” she said.
*****
&gt; Sonders added that even if the consolidation phase is close to ending, that suggests there could be more downside for some frothy names. “The good news here is I think it’s becoming a better environment for active stock pickers,” she said.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 10%, as of Thursday from its Feb. 12 high. But on Friday, the index turned around, gaining about 1.6%. That’s a positive sign for the market, particularly since it happened as rates moved higher.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.8%. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was down 2%.
*****
&gt; “I think ultimately the higher quality segments that got hit in tech and communications probably did need to see a valuation reweighting,” Sonders said. “Arguably, we had some micro bubbles in the market, and they may need to suffer more downside.”
*****
&gt; She said investors may want to adjust the allocation of their holdings regularly instead of waiting to adjustments around the calendar
*****
&gt; “If you get a two three week, four five day surge in a particular sector, pare some back,” Sonders said, nothing that’s the opposite of what most people do.

&gt; # Jobs Market Gets Reopening Boost

&gt; US payrolls grew at a solid clip month over month in February, as progress in the vaccine distribution process appeared to boost growth by enabling more of the economy to reopen. Our opinion has always been that until we have achieved widespread vaccine distribution, the in-person segments of the labor market will be slow to recover losses from a year ago. We are becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect for a 2021 economic reacceleration, and we are heartened that the hardest hit segments of the jobs market may be beginning to reflect that view.

&gt; The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added 379,000 jobs in February, exceeding Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ forecasts for a 200,000 gain. Large seasonal adjustments to the data did serve to boost the overall number by roughly 140,000, while January’s jobs gain was revised significantly higher from 49,000 to 166,000. Colder weather than normal may have also played some role, though the worst of the freeze experienced by middle America occurred just after the report’s observation window closed. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3%, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate of 61.4%.

&gt; “Last month on jobs day, we noted our optimism around an improving trajectory for vaccinations and the implications that may have for future jobs reports,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This has played out so far, and we expect continued vaccination progress to become more evident in the jobs numbers as the recovery reaccelerates.”

&gt; Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month over month and 5.3% year over year, continuing to signal that lower-wage workers have endured the worst of the pandemic’s job losses. Inflation expectations have been in particular focus for the market lately, however inflation risks from a tightening labor market are not of major concern for now in our opinion. We expect overall average hourly earnings to remain steady or even reverse as lower wage workers are rehired in service sector jobs, and we still have lots of slack in the labor market as we hover well below 2020’s peak employment.

&gt; The composition of February’s report importantly signals a reversal of COVID-19-driven trends seen in recent months. Retail trade gained 41,100 jobs while the leisure and hospitably industry gained 355,000—two segments that have been hardest hit throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, professional and business services added 63,000 jobs and government jobs fell by 86,000.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the jobs recovery in the leisure and hospitality sector has generally plateaued following an initial bounce. This segment of the labor market is highly dependent on in-person interaction, and has understandably suffered in a work-from-home environment. Unsurprisingly, service sector jobs have strongly correlated with broader trends in COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality sector alone still accounts for about 3.5 million of the 9.5 million jobs lost compared to the February 2020 peak. And while we do caution against reading too far into one month’s numbers, we are excited to see this decimated sector tick notably higher in February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We have not had to look hard to find evidence that vaccines are having an impact. Nationally, seven-day averages for new cases have fallen to below early 2020 peaks, significantly below the highs of late 2020. Perhaps most crucially, the portion of the population most vulnerable to severe symptoms has largely already received at least one dose of the vaccination. A third vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in March, and this week President Biden estimated we would have enough supply of vaccinations to cover every adult by the end of May 2021. Once people can become comfortable with the virus trends, we expect widespread hiring in in-person industries to snowball quickly. February may have signaled a start to this trend.

&gt; # Anatomy of a Bond Market Sell-off

&gt; Coming into 2021, one of our higher-conviction ideas was that we would see rising long-term interest rates in the United States; it’s one of the reasons we recommended suitable investors consider an underweight to interest rate sensitive fixed income. However, we didn’t expect interest rates to move this high, this fast. The 10-Year Treasury yield started the year at 0.91% and ended the month of February at 1.41%, down from an intraday high of 1.61%. As such, core fixed income assets are off to one of their worst starts ever (remember that as yields go up, prices go down).

&gt; “Core fixed income assets aren’t off to a very good start this year, but we don’t think investors should abandon high-quality fixed income assets as they play an important role in a diversified portfolio” says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; **So what is driving interest rates higher? Changing expectations**

&gt; Inflation and growth expectations are important factors into the fundamental outlook for interest rates. Broadly speaking, what we’ve seen in the bond market this year is a re-pricing of both higher inflation and higher growth expectations. Inflation expectations have steadily moved higher, and market-based gauges of inflation expectations are the highest they’ve been since 2011. We don’t expect much higher inflation expectations from here, but we are watching how additional fiscal stimulus flows into the economy. Additionally, it seems increasing economic growth expectations have picked up recently as well. An increase in growth expectations may put pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from its low interest rate policy sooner than expected, which has put upward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields.

&gt; An unfortunate byproduct of those higher expectations is that we’ve seen an increase in the volatility of the 10-Year Treasury. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, daily percentage changes for the 10-Year Treasury yield are above historical norms (each vertical line on the chart represents the one day percentage change in the 10-Year Treasury yield). As shown, over the past several months, yields have regularly moved 10-20% in either direction on any given day. We think this is due to the changing interest rate dynamic and believe that interest rate volatility will subside the further we get into this new interest rate regime.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Seasonal Pattern Suggests Weakness Likely Ending Soon

&gt; In the above chart we have plotted five different S&amp;P 500 seasonal patterns along side 2021 through today’s close. “All Years 1949-2020” and “All Years 1988-2020” represent longer-term and mid-term baseline patterns. “All Post-Election Years” includes every year that was a post-presidential-election year regardless of outcome. “1St Year Democratic President” applies to this post-election year and so does “Post-Election Year After Incumbent Party Loss.”

&gt; When comparing 2021 to these various past seasonal patterns, this year’s performance is above average, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently experiencing some of the weakness present in the other five patterns. Historical weakness (shaded in light blue) is most visible in the three post-election year patterns in February lasting until early to mid-March depending on the post-election year pattern. All three historical post-election year patterns suggest that current weakness could be ending soon.

&gt; # Historic Surge for the Energy Sector

&gt; The energy sector has certainly been on a wild ride over the course of the past year, perhaps the wildest of all of the S&amp;P 500 sectors. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 caused such a demand shock that oil futures traded for a negative value for the first time in history, implying that someone would pay you to take delivery of their oil!

&gt; Well, that’s in the rear-view mirror for the energy market now. Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is up over 29% as of March 2, according to data from FactSet, more than double the return of the financial sector, the second strongest sector thus far in 2021. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is trading at a blistering 30% above its 200-day moving average, the most ever using data back to 1990. While this might seem bearish on the surface, previous surges above 20% have historically bought above average returns over the next year rather than below average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The case can be made that energy could be a bit stretched in the near-term, but momentum often breeds more momentum,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Energy has been unloved for quite some time, but we may be in the early innings of a larger rally for the energy sector as the global economy continues to improve.”

&gt; A confluence of events may be spurring the boom in the energy sector. An expanding global economy, a historic winter storm that shut down major oil producing states like Texas and Oklahoma, and an output agreement from members of OPEC+ have sent oil prices soaring to their highest level since early 2019. It’s not just oil, either. Copper and lumber have surged past their 2019 highs as well. It’s no secret that inflation expectations have been on the rise, and the surge in commodity prices are likely adding further credence to the market’s view of higher inflation.

&gt; We have continued to warm up to the energy sector, including upgrading our view on oil in January and then our upgrade from negative to neutral in our February Global Portfolio Strategy publication.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week and month ahead r/stocks.",stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021",355.0,0.97
SnooMacarons1548,0.0,344.0,"First off, let's go straight to the point. The last few weeks have been a bloodbath for most of the market. To many, especially new traders, this seems like a full blown market crash. Well, it's not... a market crash needs a catalyst. Think back to every single crash, whether it was the dot com bubble, the housing bubble in 08, and even the flash crash on black Monday in 87' they all had a catalyst, if not many catalysts.

I keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.

 Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is ""the economy is overheating"". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet. I can also note that the same journalists who publish this FUD about overheating, are the same journalists who will also write that the market is crashing when there is BAD economic data (such as the job report this morning). So let's ask ourselves, how can both a booming recovery and a slow, painful recovery BOTH be ingredients for a crash? I cannot comprehend how ridiculous this is becoming. Good news = market crash, bad news = market crash. What do we need for the market not to crash? 

I can't talk about all of this without mentioning a wild phenomenon. My portfolio. A very well diversified array of etfs which hit almost all sectors of the market. The best thing to happen to it? A global pandemic/ lockdown. The worst thing? Economic strength indicators, covid cases plummeting and vaccines and stimulus getting pumped into the masses. Has the world gone mad?

My conclusion is only this. Plain and simple, fear. Fear is what's bringing this bloodbath upon us. Panic selling over irrational news articles. Just compare the VIX (fear gauge) chart with almost every single tech stock or major company's stock chart. It's literally an inverse. A mirror image.

If there is anything to take away from this is that I truly believe this is just mass hysteria and it the dust will settle. Stocks will rise again. Invest in what you believe in and avoid the FUD that's being pumped out for click bait by seemingly every news outlet.

Tl;dr: there is no crash. This is panic selling on a mass scale. Don't believe the media fud - the pandemic is ending and there is light at the end of this Corona virus tunnel. Buy the dip with money you can afford to potentially lose and all shall be good again on wallstreet. *Edit* I am not an expert, do not take this as financial advice. I was merely venting/ ranting during this paragraph. Only invest what you are willing to lose. 

Edit: I almost forgot to mention a big one: 

Another theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane. Comoanjes blew estimates out of the water left and right. Banks, big tech, e commerce, etc. These are the sectors that are being targeted heavily by fud in the media. These are also the companies doing the best they ever have. So how is this a bubble? Of course, companies like tesla and gamestop (lol) can be viewed and argued as in a bubble. But these companies are few and far between.

Edit#2 as someone here pointed out, the current p/e ratio is at around 40 for the s&amp;p500. Is this really a cause for concern? The all time high for p/e of the s&amp;p is may 2009. Arguably one of the best times in history to buy stocks as we now know. So can someone explain why this is repeatedly cited as a cause for concern? What am I missing?",stocks,Why the market is not crashing:,344.0,0.85
bigbear0083,0.0,344.0,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021.

# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
&gt; Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.
*****
&gt; # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
&gt; Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
&gt; “The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
&gt; Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
&gt; “There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
&gt; They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
&gt; Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
&gt; It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
&gt; # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
&gt; Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
&gt; “If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”
*****
&gt; The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
&gt; At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
&gt; Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
&gt; “Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.
*****
&gt; “Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
&gt; # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
&gt; The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
&gt; Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
&gt; There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
&gt; Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
&gt; The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.
*****
&gt; “The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
&gt; The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

&gt; # Presidents' Day Seasonality

&gt; The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

&gt; # Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Continues to be Weak

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

&gt; In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.

&gt; # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

&gt; “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

&gt; # Short Interest Update

&gt; Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

&gt; On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

&gt; Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

&gt; Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

&gt; Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

Krios625,0.0,337.0,"Yes the red market is scary because bond yields are up, but who actually doesn't believe that it'll bounce back. You invested where you did because you thought you could make money, if the market is irrational why would you change your opinion on what you saw. I'm personally knee deep on the semiconductor industry and still believe that a giant boom is incoming so I'm staying. Would hate to see people regret selling their stock 6 months - 1 year from now because they saw red. Just some advice, never forget to do your own DD before buying or selling anything

UpgradeNotSure,0.0,333.0,"I’ve never been a gambler, or so I thought . Always been risk averse. However, in the last year I’ve gotten really into swing trading because of the bull market (always afraid to let my money sit in an ETF for fear of a major correction). Ive justified it as being something controllable as I can make educated decisions based on charts/financials/news and not a pure gamble that’s out of my hands.

However, trading has consumed my life. I spend all my time reading charts and news. It has really started to impact my family and work life. I can step away from trading but I hate the thought of having my money sit and do nothing or the risk aversion in me is afraid of letting my funds sit in an ETF with an impending crash/correction. So I’m in this position where I know it’s affecting my life but I can’t step away from potential gains. That’s when I started questioning- do I have a gambling problem?

Does anyone else have this experience? How do you deal with it?

Edit: thanks everyone for your responses and thanks for an award! Lots of good feedback and lots of people that are in the same position. Seems to be somewhat common in trading. However, what I am taking from this is that while it may not be a “gambling problem” it is a problem. I’m not focusing on the things that really impact my life positively, like work and family. I’m going to force myself to keep 35% of my funds in an ETF and keep the rest on the side in case of a correction, which should give me some piece of mind but not glue myself to the process like I have been. Thank you all!",stocks,Do I have a gambling problem?,333.0,0.92
the_mirror_viewer01,0.0,318.0,"Hey everyone,

So we recently got NIO's 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:

1) $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue 

2) Gross margins grew to 17.2%

3) Positive full year operating cash flow 

4) $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020

5) Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs 

Overall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they've definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it's evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we're seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO's production, from the information we have, it doesn't appear it will have much of an effect.

In the earnings call, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang's homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it's also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.

It should also be knows that yes NIO's deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng's 2,223. 

If you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there's bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what's written above is bad news. Here's the [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html) for the 'bad news' these fearmongers are dragging out. 

Take the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO's cash balance). Basically not NIO's fault. Here's the [link](https://twitter.com/edison__yu/status/1366538414271660032) to his statement. 

The fact that NIO is ramping up production (remember that even at 7,500 this is more than their monthly deliveries in 2020); the fact that NIO has openly said they're entering Europe in H2 ([link](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/19912404/nio-to-begin-exporting-evs-to-europe-in-second-half-of-2021-report)); the fact they have $6.5 billion now; the fact that production will be 12,500 from July, and 25,000 in 2022--all of these show how much of a winner NIO is, and why NIOgang will stay strong. 

But watching all the negativity, it definitely reminds me of last year around this time, before NIO went up over 1,000%. I think it could happen again. I think about it while I'm at work; and I remember that it was Reddit where I first found NIO, and NIOgang

I came to realize how good apple management team is and how good Tim Cook is at navigating the space in terms of politics. Apple has some of the highest margins (seem to be only increasing), insane revenue (they are still growing), good moat (its a hardware company basically), immune to monopoly regulation (they only control like what? 6% of the entire smartphone market?), great marketing, and have a lot of vertical integration (iMessage, Apple m1, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple one, etc). They also have shit ton of cash (they can buy Netflix full on the spot basically), and assets (their headquarters is roughly worth around $5B for example). Lastly, they have a lot of room to grow because they are so far from a monopoly, and they going into other areas where they can dominate (Apple Car, Apple card, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade+). 

Here are the other areas they dominate: Apple iPad, and Apple Watch. Nothing comes close to competitors. 

The only area where I can see apple failing is if they just keep riding the wave, and get lazy with their product innovations (you can argue this is already happening). However, after the latest apple chip, and the amount of cash they have, they got to be failing a lot and for a long time for Apple to be in any bad spot. Hence, it's a safe bet in my eyes with a decent amount of upside.

It's a speculative market on steroids. Here's the evidence:

**Valuation:** The CAPE smoothed P/E multiple has [expanded](https://ycharts.com/indicators/cyclically_adjusted_pe_ratio) for six straight months. It bottomed at 24.8 in March at the price index trough, closed December at 33.7, then to 34.5 in January, and now to 34.8 in February. *By way of comparison, the multiple was 32.3 in March 2001, as the tech wreck bear market really got going; and 32.6 in September 1929*. Investors always think they can get out before the peak is in. History rhymes.

**Leverage:** Margin debt has soared 42% from a year ago (+115% at an annual rate over the past three months alone). This is exactly what the trend was in August 2007 and September 2000. *Right near the market peaks.*

**Positioning:** The put-call volume ratio has been below 0.60 with near consistency since the middle of November. It’s a stretch we haven’t seen in over eight years. The BofA survey shows that global portfolio managers are running with the lowest cash levels in eight years, and have the highest exposures to equities and commodities in a decade.

**Technicals:** The fact that the S&amp;P 500 is now 13% above its 200-day moving average is an extreme gap worth noting and monitoring — it was 11% back in February 2000, just ahead of the tech mania bust and 7% in October 2018, ahead of the near-20% drawdown heading into the end of that year.",stocks,"US companies that make no money have seen their stock prices soar 19% YTD, outperforming those that *are* profitable by 15 points...

 A record half-billion dollar redemption from Ark Invest's flagship fund in a single day has led analysts to highlight the risks arising from the ETF's heavy exposure to illiquid stocks if outflows pick up pace.

Investors yanked $465 million from Ark Innovation on Monday, according to Refinitiv data. More such redemptions would prompt Wood's fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.

Ark Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.

This is one of the problem that ark funds is trying to mitigate. Many people are very bullish and saying they are 50 to 70% into the ark funds, but they don't even know what stocks are inside these funds.

It’s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. 

- Ask yourself what you’ve learned about your risk tolerance. 

- Ask yourself what lessons you’ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. 

When the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don’t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y’all. Y’all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y’all don’t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. 

About a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai 

https://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/

I think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y’all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y’all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn’t normal. 

It’s easy to say “buy and hold forever!!!” And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it’s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. 

It’s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn’t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can’t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won’t make money. 

Personal way of dealing with this: 

When it comes to volatility, I’ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It’s hard but I’ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I’m buying and know why I am buying it. I’ve done my DD over the companies I’m in and that gives me the confidence I need to keep going. What helps me, is not looking. I’ll delete the app or turn off my computer and make myself busy. This helped me the most last spring, I used to watch it like a hawk when things would dip and I’d start to panic and think about selling. When I turn it off, that impulse goes away some. What also helped me was, before I buy anything I write down on a Word Doc, why I’m buying it; and before I sell, I write down and explain what factors changed that makes me need to sell the stock, if nothing changed, I know I’m being irrational and I need to buy the dip.

DavasiaN,0.0,247.0,"TLDR: The gamma squeeze we previously saw in $GME is starting to happen in $TLRY. The price of TLRY has skyrocketed so high that all the call options the Market Makers wrote are forcing them to buy and hold shares to hedge against uncapped losses. Between the Market Makers and the Shorts, there are less and less shares available. My guess is that the price of TLRY will continue to skyrocket until next week, at a minimum.

CONGRATS fellow TLRY/APHA holders! I strongly believe we are witnessing a huge gamma squeeze underway. Today, the price of TLRY rose above the highest strike prices on the options chain ($42), which means all the available call options are in-the-money. Market Makers released new strike prices from $45 to $65. FYI: some brokers do not show the new strike prices ($45/50/55/60/65) right away because they are scumbags.

*How can we tell this is a gamma squeeze?*

Take a look at the TODAY's call options volume for Feb 12 expiration (this Friday):

* 30,633 at the $40 strike calls
* 6,810 at the $41 strike calls
* 62,786 at he $42 strike calls

That is nearly 100,000 call options. If you add up the call volume from $30 to $42 strikes, you get over 150,000 call options traded today! Open interest was much lower than volume, which tells me these are new call positions being opened.

150,000 call options x 100 shares per call option = 15 MILLION TLRY shares that Market Makers have to buy on the open market and hold until all the contracts are resolved next week. This is only for today's volume, WE STILL HAVE 2 MORE TRADING DAYS TO GO!

To add fuel to the fire, TLRY has a significant amount of short interest and low shares float (shares that are available for trading, not locked up with institutions or insiders):

* TLRY shares float: **\~95M** / short interest: **\~32M** / today's MM hedge: \~**15M**

Let's get this straight, what we are seeing today is **not 100% a short squeeze.** This is *mostly* a gamma squeeze. However, the gamma squeeze and high short interest has an amplifying effect on each other. Market makers and shorts both have to bid against each other to buy shares on the open market, causing the price to skyrocket even higher!

For APHA holders, we should see new strike prices released tomorrow, because APHA is trading at $27 afterhours which is above the highest $25 strike. Theoretically, we could see a gamma squeeze on APHA, but I think the chance of that happening is very very low. *Why?*

APHA has a LOT more shares float (shares available to trade) and much lower short interest:

* APHA shares float: **\~312M** / short interest: **\~16M /** today's MM hedge: **maybe 5M**

That is a ton of shares available for the Market Makers to tap into, and far less shorts to fight against. You would need something like 500k or more call option volume to apply enough pressure on MM to cause a gamma squeeze. I think a true **APHA gamma squeeze is very unlikely**.

The good news for my APHA holders is that you will probably see APHA trade up with TLRY due to the pending merger, but at a steep discount (40% or more). Lots of posts/comments are raving about the huge arbitrage opportunity, but that is not realistic until a merger date is set and we get close to that date. Plus, you will need to hold your shares until the merger, which nobody really knows how long that could take.

Lastly, This is a gamma squeeze play in the short term. Realize that once the gamma squeeze is over, the trade is over and you need to get out! I will add that I love the TLRY+APHA merger, and love the fundamentals of the company. I believe they are a long term winner with multiple tailwinds in the US and Europe. I might do another FA post with DD, but right now my priority is this gamma squeeze.

Best of luck to you all!

Sukh6,0.0,241.0,"My research into BB lead me to Connected Cars, following is a summary of the report. Reports worth reading, there are charts and diagrams in the report that add value, which are not included here. 


**What are Connected Cars (CC):**
A car that has *its own connection to the internet* allowing it to share internet access and data with other devices inside and outside the car. Apart of the IoTs (everyday items connected to the internet).

Per McKinsey, connected cars will provide unique customer experience + cost and revenue benefits to mobility companies (OEMs, suppliers, dealers, insurers, fleets, tech players, etc) 


**The Opportunity**
*Monetize data from connected cars* (currently overlooked) - Cars allow for regular and extensive interactions with end customers. In other words, CC could be the new iPhone

7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data based services
 
Industries are transitioning from *hardware to software-as-a-service (SaaS) and subscription business*

37% of consumers would switch car brands to achieve improvements in ACES (Autonomous driving, Connectivity, Electrification and shared mobility), in China, 56% would switch brands

39% of customers want additional digital features , 47% for premium OEMs


**Data Monetization Should Accelerate (5 Reasons)**


**1. OEMS are focused on ST profitability &amp; in making LT investments.**
Traditional OEMS must make their core business profitable in the ST while facing challenging tailwinds (CoVid 19 decreases in sales, ICE bans worldwide and stringent emissions regulation, potential defaults on ballooning auto loans, Chip shortage)

Switching from ICE to EV will result in *lower margins* as aftersales revenue will decrease due to lower maintenance, *requiring other revenue sources*

Connected services require low initial investment and have faster development timelines compared to other technologies like ADAS (billions in investment required)

CCs can therefore offer *ST revenue and profit opportunities higher margins and recurring revenue streams*


**2. Improving Customer Experience**
Currently cars provide poor customer experience (complex sign-up and log in process) - few extend beyond trail and have to compete with smartphones for customer attention

New EV OEMS are quick to provide updates to customers cars + Tech companies are developing OS that provide access to full ecosystem of internal and external applications, such as maps -&amp;amp;gt; approach is similar to smartphones not cars


**3. Using Data to respond to regulatory pressures and new security requirements.**
Data regulation is becoming more strict, although new guidelines *provide clear framework for OEMs and data customers, rather than limiting the speed and development of data monetization*

*Cybersecurity is increasingly important for connected cars*: UN Economic Commission for Europe *requires* OEMs to ensure cybersecurity throughout the development process and fix any software issues with OTA updates


**4. Dealing with technology advances &amp;amp;amp; new players**
 a) more powerful E/E (electronic/electric) architectures that enable features such as OTA updates
 b) improved *sensors, including cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), that collect additional data points*
 c) significantly increased computing power and interconnectivity


**5. Increased Importance of Life Cycle monetization and new business models**
Auto industry is moving rewards life-cycle monetization, rather than focusing on revenues at point of sale and in the aftermarket, these trends will likely accelerate due to: *Sales shifting online &amp;amp;amp; Subscriptions models will become more popular*


**Conclusion**
Leveraging car data and connectivity would enable use cases (9 outlined in the article), I will highlight 3:

 a) competitive in-car entertainment options that can compete with smartphones
 b) infrastructure operators lack data about condition and usage of their assets (battery chargers)
 c) fleet operators missing data that could help better manage vehicle maintenance and repair

These use cases could generate **$250 and $400 billion in annual incremental value for players across the ecosystem**

By 2030, 95% of new vehicles sold globally will be connected, up from 50% today

**Blackberry IVY** is being developed to ""harness data in the car""

TL;DR at the bottom.

This is the first DD I'm posting, let me know anything I should fix.

# Who is Corsair?

Corsair is a company that makes computer components such as fans, power supplies, SSDs, cases, coolers, RAM, and other peripherals. Since the pandemic, the gaming industry has seen huge growth with an influx of people looking for ways to spend time and the new dependence on home computers. It is my opinion that even after the pandemic, many will continue to purchase computer components and many will continue to work from home if possible.

# News.

Recently, Corsair has acquired Visuals by Impulse. Visuals is a streamer's tool to create overlays and alerts on their stream. With some streamers making millions of dollars per year, there is no doubt that streaming is an appealing prospect. In recent years, the number of active streamers has gone from around 3 million to 9 million with no signs of slowing down. The streaming industry is just getting started.

Streamers Per Year:

[https://imgur.com/a/WPUFhoE](https://imgur.com/a/WPUFhoE)

Corsair also released its earnings report on February 9th. Corsair beat their estimate but not expectations, so the stock dipped right after earnings from $44.70 down to $31.84 today. The tech selloff over the week has also affected the stock greatly. Other than that, the stock has been relatively quiet.

# Income and Revenue.

Corsair makes a majority of its revenue, $1.7bn up 55% from last year, from selling PC components(\~69%), and a good chunk of revenue comes from peripherals(\~31%). Corsair has seen consistent growth in revenue over the past couple of years and quarters.

Net Revenue was around 465 million, **up around 241 million from last year(\~192%).**

Net Income was at 103 million up from -8 million.

# Pros:

\- The price to book ratio is very low compared to the sector's(About 5 compared to 18).

\- The intrinsic value (at least according to my calculation) is higher than the current price even with a margin of safety of 10%.

\- Corsair is a very well respected brand in computers.

\- In the next few years, there will be big changes in the CPU market, and DDR5 RAM may come out, leading many to be looking for an upgrade.

\- The GPU shortage may end soon and people will be looking for PSUs to feed the GPUs and maybe fans and cases to better cool their PCs. Also, with the releases of the 3060 and AMD's equivalent coming soon to hopefully replace the 1060, many will be looking for new computer components. The 1060 currently makes up 9.62% of the GPUs used by Steam(gaming) users. With around 24% of Steam users using 3-4-year-old GPUs, there is no doubt that many will be looking for an upgrade soon. **KEEP IN MIND**, Corsair does **not** sell GPUs, but they sell items that are often purchased with GPUs.

\- Very high short float \~25% (Short squeeze?).

\- If you believe in Fibonacci retracements, Corsair is in the buy zone based on a 1-Year, 1-Day candle retracement from $22.97 to $51.26, -61.8% retracement puts the value at around $67.8.

# Cons:

\- There is a lot of competition in the industry, a lot of companies make SSD's, PSUs, RAM, etc.

\- Due to the silicone shortage, upgrading a PC is harder so it may lower the odds that people need new RAM, power supplies(power-hungry GPUs and CPUs), or cooling. This may be a good thing because once the shortage ends(hopefully), there should be a huge increase in the number of people purchasing products for their PCs.

\- I'm probably biased towards Corsair.

\- Current bearish momentum.

TL;DR: I'm bullish on Corsair in the long term, I believe that it is very undervalued right now. With changes coming to the computing industry, I see very big potential in the growth of Corsair.

But seriously, he's been a huge help. We've bonded over it actually, he just throws out too much at once.

I dropped all my shares in a certain drone company when the stock dropped like a brick after some bozo posted a hit piece on it without stopping to check the ridiculously written sources or use common sense. That being said, I lucked out. I sold at a tiny profit, and got back in at a much lower price. 
3. I've realized that if something causes a stock to explode, the prime time to get in on that train has already passed by the time I hear about it so there's no point in rushing to get in on it or putting everything on it. 
4. Quickly trying to turn around stocks within days for a quick buck rapidly lost its appeal and I've drifted over to mid to long term holds 
5. There's a bunch of loudmouth assholes all over the yahoo message boards and I wish it'd get moderated. I want to see useful posts, not spamming links and people telling other people how much money they have and how stupid everyone is. 
6. I do check my account all the damn time. It's addicting. 
7. Those of you who post well thought out posts backed by great DD and facts, I see you. Thanks. It's honorable to take the time to help out others when you get nothing in return. 
8. Those of you who spout off nonsense like you think you know what you're talking about but you don't, you just want to appear smarter than everyone else to make up for the fact your dad never thought much of you, I see right through you, and don't think much of you either. 
9. I get the sense that many new investors think they're special, the stocks they buy are special, they assume they're going to hit it big because they believe the loudmouths saying they made a million in a day and I suggest that you remove the egocentric view and look at it objectively. It's a VERY big lesson I learned in my long sports betting career. 
10. I'll say it again. There's much to learn. Last two weeks I've learned what all the numbers and statistics on stocks were (yields, earnings, dividend, 52 week high/low etc). Now I'm focusing on researching companies and comparing what i find to how the stock behaves. Next I'll move on to candlestick patterns and how to anticipate them. Trying to absorb everything at once you'll fail
11. Options, calls, warrants - Nope. If I don't understand it, I don't do it. I feel a pang of pity when a new investor loses everything because they jumped into that stuff without understanding it.

ramjaz,0.0,213.0,"I've been seeing some well-written posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li0rpg/blackberry_a_dormant_giant/) one and [this as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfuoe9/bb_is_not_a_phone_company_heres_some_dd/), as I'm sure you have as well. It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

\- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**",stocks,Why BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock,213.0,0.85

1) Invest only what you are willing to lose

2) Invest within your level of risk tolerance

3) Invest in companies that you have faith in, that you’ve researched, and that you’re willing to go long on

4) Build up your emotional and mental strength    because there will always be red days/weeks/months/years in the future

5) Do not panic when you see red days—this could bring about some buying opportunities

6) If you feel that you’re not ready to jump into the market, you can always A) invest in an ETF, B) invest with an advisor who will sell you a mutual fund, C) learn how to do it by studying the ins and outs of company fundamentals.

It just simple rebalancing. If TSLA losses in value they buy more and if it gains more they sell it. They maintain a certain % of portfolio value. TSLA when in losing streak and they buy more to maintain the holding ratio.

uknj,0.0,202.0,"# $ON - ON Semiconductor

First time posting DD - please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of the post.

### TL; DR - Why I'm Long $ON.

ON Semiconductor Corporation, manufactures and sells semiconductor components for various electronic devices worldwide (see below for a detailed breakdown of products / services).

- The **semiconductor industry** as a whole is expected to **increase by 8.4%** in 2021^(1). Personally, I think it will continue throughout 2021 and possibly into H1 2022 as macroeconomic should continue to improve and pent-up demand is released.

- ON has historically struggled and maintained **lower revenue growth and profit margins** over FY19, FY20 Q1 and Q2 both historically and especially when compared with its peers.

- FY20 Q3 and Q4 have shown a significant turnaround which have allowed it to exceed average quarterly revenue growth for FY19. This is in part due to macroeconomic recovery.

- They have recently brought on a **new CEO and CFO** to turnaround their business. The new CEO has **experience growing both revenues and margins** at Cypress Semiconductors. He was also a moving force behind the **merger** of Infineon Technologies and Cypress which could point out the eventual direction of the organisation.

- A primary reason for the **lower margins** are the use of several global semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) which increase the overall cost of goods. The organisation is in the process of **building a new fab** (in Fishkill, NY) and releasing multiple fabs (e.g., Belgium, Japan). The use of Fishkill should significantly **improve margins** and bring it more in-line with competitors.

- A key source of revenue (**~30%**^(2)) has been the **automotive sector**. As vehicle electrification (conversion of non-electrical vehicle systems) and the focus on the development of electric cars increases over the next few years the amount of $ON products within vehicles is likely to increase. As a result, **revenue will increase** from this sector. This area is likely to also be higher margin.

- Additionally, $ON products find their ways into **vehicle charging** and **battery technology** which is also a growing area. Global drive for **power efficiency** will also increase in the face of the ""Green Deal"" and increasing global drive for **CO2 reduction**.

- The business currently has the **free cash flow** and **shareholder backing** necessary to re-focus their business away from low-margin and revenue declining products to focus on **high growth and high-margin** areas. While this does depend on management execution at the present time, I see no reason why given historical track records of the new leadership they would be unable to deliver on this promise.

- Current P/E remains high (~69^(nice)x) however **forward P/E at 23x** is a lot more attractive particularly with the view presented above.

Please do have a read of the Bear / Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced view and an idea of drawbacks / considerations.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 08/02/2021

1. Share Price: $39.81

2. Market Cap: 15.787 B

3. Next Earnings: 31-03-2021

4. Analyst Day - 05-08-2021 (This is a day where they will talk about overall strategy and financial targets).

# Detailed Analysis

### Organisation Summary

Manufactures and sells semiconductor components focussed on 3 main segments:

1. Power Solutions Group – Target markets are industrial, and power focussed.

2.  Advanced Solutions Group – Target markets are industrial including automotive (this is a growing market segment and includes electric vehicles^(3) and autonomous capability^(4)), consumer including personal electronics e.g. laptops etc. (this is a slowly growing and relatively stable market segment barring unforeseen macroeconomic issues^(5)), computing (cloud power management - growing particularly due to remote working requirements and increasing cloud focus from organisations^(6)) and industrial communications (IoT – growing area^(7)), medical (medical imaging – stable, clinical point of care e.g. quick diagnosis / testing – most likely growing, patient monitoring – growing, portable medical devices – growing^(8)) and aerospace / defence (stable, commercial aerospace most likely shrinking to a degree^(9), space related chips – possibly growing longer term?). Also provides custom design / fabrication (probably small market segment / overall revenue contributor).

3. Intelligent Sensing Group - Image sensors, proximity sensors etc. across similar markets to ASG. Again, expected to grow both from an industry perspective but also from a product perspective^(1).

### Bull Considerations

- The Fishkill fab at maximum capacity is expected to allow for the generation of **2 B in revenues**. The current timeframes expectations are that this capacity can be reached by **2023**.

- The ramping of Fishkill is a few months ahead of schedule and the organisation is actively seeking to **sell two fabs** in Belgium and Japan which should make available some cash.

- Continued growth expected in higher margin product areas incl. automotive, communications (e.g., 5g), medical etc. (See Organisation Summary for details).

- ON may prove to be a **viable merger / acquisition target** - M&amp;A isn't an area I'm too sure on how to research so this may be way off base.

- Weiss Asset Management **increased holdings** by 4.3% (as a portion of portfolio) around the last half year / year to 5.2% could signal bullish institutional sentiment.

- Relatively high level of cash flow will mean they are likely to be able to maintain the interest payments of ~140 / year. Additionally, their assets more than cover their liabilities.

- Good growth in both EPS ($0.38 and $0.21 in Q3 and Q4 FY20 respectively - Q3 was higher due to income tax return) and free cash flow (101.8 and 283.9 for Q3 and Q4 FY20) on a quarterly basis over the last year.

### Bear Considerations

- For FY19 the largest 5 customers across each business unit (PSG, ASG, ISG) comprise 41%, 35% and 48% of revenues respectively. This means a loss in even one of the largest customers would have material downwards impact on revenue. 10 of the largest customers represent 27% of total group revenue.

- Increases in prices of raw materials e.g., gold, copper, silicon etc. would cause significant negative impact to profit margins.

- While not fully cyclical in nature they are expecting fluctuations in results from quarter to quarter over the next year. While I don't expect the dips to be significant especially when compared with '20Q1 and '20Q2, or FY19 this could still put a damper on my price expectations.

- Any significant dips in revenues and free cash flows would impact ability to repay loans, this could impact ability to repay loans.

### Neutral Considerations

- Moody’s gives $ON a credit rating of **Ba1** which is sub-prime i.e., reasonable credit risk / risk of default but speculative in nature so could have upside^(9).

- The new Head of Intelligent Sensing Group has significant experience in automotive products (incl. at Nvidia) which could indicate additional product focus on the autonomous driving side.

- No insiders have been purchased shares since 2016 and have been selling since then. However, one thing to note is that organisation executives / leadership are typically long-standing employees, and this is presumably not atypical behaviour.

- If the demand drops again then ON face underutilisation charges for their facilities and machinery which would reduce gross margin.

- Failure to execute on streamlining business would result in large capital expenditures on new / re-focussed product areas without the required return.

- Weak track record on M&amp;A activity with acquisitions to date being sub-optimal and not really synergising with current offerings or opening significant new markets. If this continues would negatively affect price and waste free cash flow.

Many of the PUT holders for $GME and $AMC are going to realize that their puts have also increased in value. They'll be like wtf? This happens because one of the greeks is called Vega which controls options prices based on implied volatility changes.

When IV increases significantly, prices for both calls and puts also increase by a large amount because an increase in vega positively correlates with an increase in prices irrespective of whether it's a call or put.

Another tip. If you really like the $GME company, you can sell far out of the money puts tomorrow (cash secured puts) for extremely high premiums. That gives you an extremely low risk and high reward. I might sell Jan 22 $20 puts.

**Introduction**

“[FuboTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV) ($FUBO) is an American streaming television service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies.

Launched on January 1, 2015 as a soccer streaming service, FuboTV changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model. As a vMVPD, FuboTV still calls itself sports-first but its expanded channel lineup targets cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated features that can be streamed through smart TVs, mobile and tablets and the web. The service is available in the United States, Canada and Spain as of 2018.""

From their [home](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome) page:

They are the only competitors in their space of digital sports broadcasting, offer 4K streaming and upscaling of live sports, cloud DVR capability ranging from 250 or 1000 hours on standard plans, and is available on Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox One, Android TV, Android Smart TVs, and Android/iOS smartphones and tablets, with plans ranging from $24.99/month to $79.99/month (not including add-ons).

[They have also recently acquired one company and have made plans to acquire another to allow for in-house sports betting. They have stated in a press release that they plan to release a sportsbook before the end of the year.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-accelerates-development-sportsbook-140000632.html) This will push them into a broader spectrum outside of only TV and sports streaming, and into the sports betting sector along with DraftKings ($DKNG), FanDuel ($PDYPY), and Penn National Gaming ($PENN).

[**Plans and Add-ons**](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/channels)

FuboTV offers three standardized plans as of February 8, 2021: the Family plan is priced at $64.99/month (normally $75.97/month), Elite at $79.99/month (normally $100.95/month), and Latino Quarterly at $24.99/month, along with offering additional add-ons. Each plan offers a range of channels, cloud DVR capabilities (which allows fast-forwarding through commercials), and casting to multiple devices simultaneously. Only the Elite plan does not offer a 7-day free trial (*Channels page).*

The Family plan includes 117 channels (mostly news and entertainment with roughly 40 that offer sports, including ESPN), up to 250 hours of DVR space, and casting to 3 devices at once. The quarterly prepaid includes a free upgrade to 1000 hours of DVR space and 5 casting devices at home with 3 on the go (*Channels page).*

The Elite plan includes 164 channels (includes an additional “47 entertainment channels”), up to 1000 hours of DVR space, and casting to 5 devices at home with 3 on the go. This plan does not offer a quarterly prepaid (*Channels page).*

The Latino Quarterly plan includes 250 hours of DVR space and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but only has 32 channels. This plan needs to be prepaid every 3 months for a total charge of $74.97 and does not offer a monthly service (*Channels page).*

Upgrades include additional DVR space--1000 hours for an additional $6.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly--and increased device casting--an additional 2 devices at home with 3 on the go for another $9.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly plans. You can also add a variety of channels and sports packages (the Latino Quarterly has fewer channel add-ons compared to the Family and Elite plans, which both have the same channel varieties). Sports Plus with NFL RedZone is an additional $10.99/month, but includes all professional and college sports broadcasting services for football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, fighting, etc. (*Channels page).*

Fubo has recently removed its former Standard plan, which included only 65 channels, up to 2 casting devices, and only 30 hours of DVR support for $60/month.

**Financials and Growth**

Fubo has yet to file an annual report as they have gone public in October of 2020, but they have filed a [10-Q](https://s21.q4cdn.com/819998841/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/16be93b6-1b43-471a-a81f-a8b07e43e47c.pdf) for Q3 2020. All numbers in thousands.

Assets-

Between December 31, 2019 and September of 2020, assets have increased from $368,225 to $799,313 (a 117% increase) . Total current assets increased from $17,973 to $58,016, but accounts receivable decreased from $8,904 to $6,975--this may be attributed to the increase in prepaid subscriptions which increased from $1,445 to $12,177 which shows strong customer satisfaction and retention.

Liabilities-

Liabilities have increased from $145,049 to $290,376 (a 100% increase). The largest contributors to their liabilities are “Due to related parties” increasing from $665 to $85,847, “Warrant liabilities” increasing from $24 to $28,085, and “Accounts payable” from $36,373 to $61,679. Long-term borrowings have decreased from $43,982 to $25,905.

Revenues-

Subscription revenues increased by $53,433, totaling $92,945 for the year. Total revenues including advertisements and licensing have increased by $61,202, totaling $112,669 for the year and an increase of 47% YOY. Q4 revenue is estimated to be between $94,000 and $98,000 which would be a 77-84% increase YOY.

Expenses-

Subscriber related expenses total $114,315 for the year. Total expenses have totaled $500,249 for the year.

Subscribers-

Ended Q3 with 455,000 paid subscribers, a YOY increase of 58%, and plans to end 2020 with over 545,000, an increase of 72% YOY.

**The vMVPD Sector**

Cord-cutting has become increasingly popular over the last few years with consumers dropping traditional cable and satellite networks in favor of streaming services--such as Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, etc.--and vMVPD services.

[In 2019 alone, 6.3 million people cut their cable connection, totaling 39.3 million. In a survey of what they might miss most from cable networks, 52% said they don’t miss anything, 23% missed live events on TV, 22% missed news, and 19% missed live sports](https://www.emarketer.com/content/most-cord-cutters-aren-t-missing-cable-tv)*.* Although not all of those that miss aspects of cable will pay for another subscription service, the sentiment exists for a sports-focused platform that offers other large networks as well.

[Another report by Parks Associates reveals that 17% of vMVPD subscribers switched from traditional TV within the last twelve months. In the same report, a survey conducted on current broadband households determined that 43% were “likely to switch to a… vMVPD within the next 12 months](https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/video/article/14196415/report-examines-vmvpd-sector-growth-in-broadband-pay-tv-market)*.""* The potential growth exists for the live digital broadcasting space, although it is slowing down.

With the spread of COVID and quarantines, people have been spending more time at home. When things open and quarantines end, that will be the true test for these providers as people will spend less time watching TV.

**The Sports Betting Sector**

Legal sports betting has taken a huge leap in recent years with the introduction of online sports betting; the ability to place wagers from anywhere at any time and have instant gratification has boomed with its slow legalization. [This sector has a forecasted value of $150 billion with other competitors already having a completed project and vast market share. In 2019, DraftKings ($DKNG) and FanDuel (PDYPY) controlled 83% of the market share](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html).

[FuboTV plans to join into this space with its own sportsbook. Their recent acquisition of Balto Sports in December of 2020, whose business was in simulating fantasy sports games, is Fubo’s first step into sports wagering. They plan to create a free-to-play gaming system alongside online sports wagering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201006185/en/fuboTV-Acquires-Balto-Sports-as-First-Step-Into-Online-Sports-Wagering-Market)*.*

[Their next planned acquisition, which was announced in January of 2021, will be to acquire Vigtory, a sports betting and interactive gaming company. According to BusinessWire, they plan to utilize Vigtory’s “sportsbook platform and digital gaming assets, and its consumer-driven betting technology, to develop a frictionless betting experience for fubo’s customers](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005596/en/fuboTV-Accelerates-Development-of-Sportsbook).""

These recent acquisitions set Fubo up to create an all-in-one viewing and betting experience, which could add new customers to their subscriber list and seal them into online wagering.

[It has been over two years since the Supreme Court has denied the federal ban on sports betting, which would have made online betting illegal in all of the United States. Currently, more than two dozen states have legalized sports betting, but most have only legalized in-person betting. More states may be willing to legalize to take advantage of the increased revenues and taxes associated with gambling and online wagering. As of 2020, six additional states plan to legalize some form of betting, although some are only allowing in-person. There are an additional 14 states that are considering the notion to allow legal gambling, whether in-person, online, or tribal](https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/legal-sports-betting-united-states-projections).

**Management and Investors**

David Gandler - CEO / Director / Co-Founder

Appointed as CEO and director in April of 2020. Prior to Fubo, Gandler had a 15 year career in marketing and advertising in local broadcast and cable TV within both general and Hispanic markets at companies such as Time Warner, Telemundo, and Scripps Networks Interactive.

Alberto Horihuela - CMO / Co-founder

In charge of marketing, Horihuela was head of Latin America for SVOD service DramaFever.

Simone Nardi - CFO

Nardi has worked as SVP and CFO of Scripps Networks Interactive where he was responsible for the finance and strategic planning for the company’s international business. Was also a key player in refinancing TVN S.A.’s billion dollar debt.

Large Investors

* Islet Management, LP with 5,108124 shares
* Morgan Stanley with 3,317,333 shares
* FMR LLC with 1,262,907 shares
* BlackRock Inc. with 956,678 shares
* Merger with FaceBank for $100 million revolving credit

**Analysts and Estimates**

Average analyst ratings put Fubo at a Buy to Strong Buy rating with an average price target of $45.50 with a high of $60 and a low of $30. EPS estimates are estimated to be -5.23 for 2020 and -1.64 for 2021.

Currently has a short float of about 75%, but the short volume has been holding at roughly 15-20% over the last month and has drastically declined from its October short volume of over 50%.

Originally valued at $700 million less than a year ago, a current valuation of $3.19 billion is respectable for this company and is on par for its current performance.

**Risks**

* Marketing fails and Fubo is never known as a household name, so consumers stick with other more known providers
* Their sportsbook fails and becomes dead weight and wasted money
* Subscriber count and streaming drops as quarantine lifts, reducing revenues while maintaining expenses
* Consumers opt for cheaper options
* People paying for the sports package cancel when the season is over, creating a boom and bust cycle if not managed correctly

**Final Thoughts / TL;DR**

With its drastic growth over the last year (400% in the last 4 months), support from FaceBank and well-known investors, and plans to join the sports betting sector, FuboTV has potential to become a household name and grow well beyond its current valuation by combining both sports broadcasting and online sports betting into one convenient place. Although unlikely to overthrow any of the current forces, it can become the best live sports broadcaster that people can turn to when they cut cable but want to keep live sports. It has many hurdles to overcome (creating their sportsbook, better marketing, increasing subscriber count, etc.) before it is any real competition to its already established competition.

At a $3.19 billion market cap and very high (75%) short interest, it will be very difficult to realize consistent growth, but it is on par for a company with almost $100 million in revenue.

I generally invest in high growth data stocks as I work in the industry and I’m beginning to think blackberry will be nicely positioned in a couple of years to dominate and worst case the rising tide will raise all the boats.

Smarter people can break down the financials so I want to focus on positioning, markets, branding, board members and the AWS partnership. I’m doing my best to clean up my last post because I realize this is a higher level of discourse.


1. Repeat CEO: you’re not paying for someone to learn on the job, John Chen has done it before and can handle the stress. I’m thinking this is his swan song. 

He has a 90 million dollar bonus at a $30 USD price point for 10 days by 2023. don’t think CEOs generally miss out on 90 million dollar bonuses but hey what do I know.


2. Potential market size: IOT security and data collection. I personally care the most about their auto investment in QNX and IVY but the board of directors reflect a whole slew of other bets that are also potentially majorly profitable. 

The military side of the equation may become more material with the New board member: Lisa Disbrow. 
Once again I’ll defer to smarter people to do market evaluation and sizing. 


3. Sales orientation/cycle: this is a company that usually deals with governments, financial institutions, and enterprise clients. They are used to the longer and more complex sales cycles associated with this so there will be no learning curve when approaching larger clients.


4. [Board of directors:](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/board-of-directors) I like to follow money and influence.


Interesting highlights:

John Chen’s: CEO that delivered an exit of Sybase. Really strong history of maintaining relationships in China and on trade boards with China. See BOD link above.

Prem Watsa: Canada’s Warren Buffett. Reddit deity of justifying this investment. Fairfax financial and a value investor. He brought in John Chen

Mike Daniels: John Chen’s Sybase buddy and cybersecurity executive. Well positioned to influence across the cyber security industry

Timothy Dattels: TPG Capital major investor in Asia.

Lisa Disbrow: New Board member. She is the military connection and was Senate-confirmed Under Secretary of the United States Air Force, and she served as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from January 2017 to May 2017.

Richard Lynch : Ex-cto of Verizon wireless.

Dr. Smaldone Alsup: Pharma positioning, take a look at [PharmApprove](https://pharmapprove.com) and you’ll get a better sense of her speciality working on positioning.

Barbara Stymiest: Big player in Canada. Current portfolio includes: director of George Weston Limited, Sun Life Financial Inc. and the University Health Network, and is Chair of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. For you Americans out there George Weston is the really big name there.

Wayne Wouters: Strategy and policy advisor on the government front. at one point he was Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister of Canada.

Just wanted to give a high level breakdown of the board and if you can give a more complete picture on benefits and risks of these players I’d love to hear it.


5. BLACKBERRY IVY:  Generally I don’t look that deeply into products but I’ll do you all a favour and break down the branding and real market value to both companies.

It’s an Amazon partnership but it’s called Blackberry Ivy. Does that strike you as being a bit interesting? They avoided the Amazon brand name on purpose. BB owns the commercial relationship limiting Amazon’s exposure to the customer and fear of being screwed by the 2nd largest company in the world.

Auto execs are all aware of competition risks coming from Apple and Google. Also on the Google front they have learned from advertising that Google like to own the data. Tesla is a direct competitor so I don’t see much risk losing OEM business to then.

It’s been branded blackberry and avoided touching anything associated with data ownership to make the product more attractive to the OEMs.

They are looking for a monopoly on the censors and data transfer and have what seems like a 2 year head start. 
This is a rounding error for Amazon but material for bb. Amazon payoff will be the number of clients that transfer to AWS because of ease of integration and reduced costs of moving the data.

6. Blackberry and Apple: every single employee of blackberry knows what happened with Apple and knows what happens when you sit comfortably on a lead as opposed to paying offence. If you are worried about a company culture that is stagnant and moving too slowly go find someone who is currently winning not a comeback kid.

7. Negatives: 
Shit brand with reputation as an loser. 

ARR: the only thing that really matters. Of course Ivy is a subscription that wasn’t a surprise. They need to show positive growth and then you can be considered a 10-20x revenue cap. Do that for 4 quarters and then you can be a cool kid and get to 50x.

BuffettsBrokeBro,0.0,190.0,"It’s hard to argue with the logic that ETFs / low cost funds are probably the best bet for most investors, if not all. But the key point is here - over the long term. While they should absolutely form the backbone of a long term investing portfolio, and it’s important to recognise we’re in a raging bull market, I think it’s also important to acknowledge that this strategy is primarily about the gradual accumulation of wealth. It can be used in conjunction with a strategy that embraces higher risk for higher reward. To make that wealth. 

It doesn’t mean that ETFs shouldn’t be at the core of a portfolio, it just means it’s also okay to get involved in more speculative plays, try to swing trade sentiment etc.

They key factors to consider are:

- don’t go all in on risky trades

- do DD. Consider the bear case for every bull case

- make a thesis on the direction of a stock. Consider throughout the “why?”, and be clear on your goals

- set clear price points for taking profits, and for getting into a stock. Don’t buy in at all-time highs unless it supports your thesis for future growth. Don’t “diamond hands” a volatile stock into being worth nothing

- being right too early is the same as being wrong. You face opportunity cost with your money tied up, and you could see a stock bleed further. 

- averaging down is a sensible strategy for good stocks, not a way to try and dilute the loss from FOMOing into a speculative stock during an all-time high.

The focus should still be on adding money into ETFs / funds, rather than trying to play the lottery with all of the savings account / pay cheque, but it can absolutely be a solid play to pick individual stocks for the higher risk / higher reward potential.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 22, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed as rising Treasury yields and expectations of higher inflation weighed on equity prices. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.

Prospects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental factors, such as favorable fiscal and monetary policy and growing corporate earnings, remain in place to support a post-pandemic bull market. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury Yield rate made by Bloomberg📷

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has so far seen just under 64.2 million doses administered to Americans as of Monday morning, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 75.3 million doses have so far been delivered to states, inclusive of both Moderna's and Pfizer's and BioNTech's vaccines. Last week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago according to data analyzed by the New York Times. The drop in cases is staggering given that on January 8, the US recorded more than 300,000 new cases. 

**Highlights**

* A lot of popular EV stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Nio (NIO), Plug Power (PLUG) and many others have been pulling back sharply in recent days. Remember Psychos, many of these stocks were overvalued 1-2 weeks ago, pullbacks like this represent an opportunity.
* After reaching an impressive high of $58,000, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back around 10% today.
* The dollar slid against major currencies, slumping to multi-year lows against the British pound and the Australian dollar, another sign of rising fears of inflation
* Australia will not alter legislation that would make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, as Canberra neared a final vote on whether to pass the bill into law. Remember, as of now, Facebook (FB) is not showing any news to its users in Australia.
* China’s bank regulator on Saturday tightened requirements on the internet loan business of commercial banks, amid heightened scrutiny of online lending by internet giants such as Ant Group, the finance arm of Alibaba Group.

codebrotherone,0.0,185.0,"**Summary**

*NIO* is a chinese electric vehicle company founded in Nov 2014 had its 1.8 Billion dollar IPO in the U.S. on September 12, 2018. NIO is traded as an ADR (american depository receipt), which is a negotiable security representing an investment in a foreign company, has only been around for 7 years, starting at $9 during its IPO and rising to $56.67 as of 2/5/2021.

It is currently the **fifth largest car company by market cap** under Tesla and Toyota, beating the likes of GM, BMW and Daimler. This is incredible considering they have only been trading in the US for 3 years, and the troubles they have gone through since then.

Pros:

* Low short interest, per yahoo finance.
* Incredibly quarterly sales growth, since having a down quarter in Mar 2020 (Q1). Since then, they have increased 166% and 24.69% QoQ from Q2 to Q3 2020.
* Strong Dec 2020 sales, and deliveries of EV cars increasing 121% YoY.
* Beating analyst estimates in Q3 2020 showing a positive turnaround and forward outlook for the company.
* Unique approach to batteries, all their products use the same battery type and have invested into BaaS.
* New records high quarterly deliveries in 2020 Q3, representing 100% You growth.
* Launch of the 100kWh battery pack, and a focus on providing users with a a choice of purchasing the pack or renting one for a monthly fee.
* Back to back positive cash flow, with vehicle margins increased to 14.5%.
* Battery swap stations are faster than charging stations.
* Delivered 12k ES8/ES6/ES6s/Ec6s in Q3 2020, with 16-17k more expected in Q4 2020.

Cons:

* \-12.1% gross margin in 2019 Q3, rising to 12.9% in 2020 Q3.
* 10/6/2 Buy/Sell/Hold ratings and overweight consensus, per WSJ.
* EPS has been decreasing, while net income was flat for Q3 2020.
* State owned rivals such as Li, Xpeng, and Tesla could pose serious risks.
* They needed a US $1 billion bailout in 2020 because they couldn’t sell their vehicles and even missed payroll in Feb 2020, almost going bankrupt.
* High capital investment industry, with low room for error.
* Overvalued, as investors chase the ‘next Tesla’.

Conclusion

Nio is currently being described as the ‘next Tesla’, though it is 1/10 of Tesla’s market cap. Though Tesla is considered as over-valued by analysts, I believe that Nio has not been profitable long enough to match the level of enthusiasm that investors feel for Tesla. [Nio has had a rocky start, and a recent dip (as of 2/5/2021) as some investors have chosen to cash in on their investments. ](https://investorplace.com/2021/01/december-figures-keep-both-sides-nio-stock-case/)

Take a look at the vehicle margins in Q3 2020 (14.5%) which is a huge turn around from almost going bankrupt in 2020, and not being able to pay for payroll in Feb 2020. They have had an incredible gain in gross profit as well, seeing positive growth from the cash injection they had in 2020. They are also projecting higher estimates for 2020 Q4 (expected in Mar 9, 2021) for vehicle deliveries, while providing unique services that decouple the user from having to go to a charge station.

Tesla had toyed with the idea of swappable battery packs as well, but have never actually deployed them as they re-invested in their supercharger network. Nio has already established a network of swappable battery stations in China, and is actually able to lower the prices of its EV lineup by offering customers the option of renting a battery pack via a subscription model.

This is a turning point, and a make or break moment for Nio. Today I heard they announced the intention to sell vehicles in the U.S. I think they could be huge if they can continue to deliver on vehicles, and I am extremely bullish on it.

Overall a fantastic quarter/year but I question their ability to continue to grow revenue in a rising interest rate environment and shrinking real estate market. Leadership clearly is aware of the problem and are working on ways to grow but I really don't have a ton of confidence that this will be possible given that the historical growth in these arms has been minimal and throwing more money at the problem isn't necessarily a solution.

rareliquid,0.0,183.0,"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry this is wrong in the title). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom. Would love to know all your thoughts as well.

**What Does Palantir Do?**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization’s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir’s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir’s customers is Skywise, an aviation platform that has become the central operating system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company’s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company’s total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir’s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir’s expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer’s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially using Palantir’s software for its operations and Palantir can also upsell to the customer by continually offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase, In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what’s known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir’s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir’s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it’s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir’s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir’s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir’s differentiated services and business model is one of the company’s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company’s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir’s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don’t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir’s growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn’t foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir’s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I’m adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade
   * The remaining 80% is available to trade starting February 19th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and government revenue by 68%
   * With all this said, one piece of concern in Palantir’s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially near break-even
   * However, the company’s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company’s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I’m Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.

ChairSoggy6394,0.0,176.0,"I think this is the best advice I've received when it comes to the stock market. You can have the greatest system in the world, but if you're not mechanically applying your rules and committing 100% to them (win or los), you'll create a cycle where you condition yourself to break your system on a hunch, feeling, or whatever.

My personal mentor told me that if she's lost money on a position, she's proud to have lost it because she didn't compensate or compromise her rules. Can you imagine that? If she's made money on a position, she's equally proud and for the same reasons. In essence, she defines her success by the measure of how close to her rules she executed, not by how much she makes. Which is a lot I can tell you.

It's a way to decondition yourself from thinking in terms of win or lose. Win or lose is a very binary and primitive condition. To be a pro, you have to have principles, rules, and mechanical execution. It requires discipline and probably years of an almost zen like state of trading when you see nothing but red figures or green figures. Panic or greed simply do not exist in such a state.

**Mohawk Group Holdings ($MWK)**

Summary:

* Mohawk uses AI and machine learning to identify and acquire DTC brands.
* They recently acquired Healing Solutions, an essential oils brand that is expected to increase their revenue by $20-$50 million.
* They've already made several strategic acquisitions like this and plan to continue this approach to scale their revenue.
* Their software gives them a unique advantage over competitors plus allows them to make more profit from the brands they acquire.

**What they do:**

Mohawk Group taps into 2 major trends that aren’t going away anytime soon: e-commerce and artificial intelligence.

Their Artificial Intelligence Mohawk E-commerce Engine (AIMEE), Mohawk uses huge amounts of data and machine learning to research and identify which consumer products sell online then either launch or acquire brands in these niches.

This has allowed Mohawk to build a mini-conglomerate of consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands that sell mainly through Amazon.

**Why they’re getting hype:**

According to Unbiastock.com total Reddit mentions of Mohawk Group increased by more than 2500% from 02/19/21 to 02/21/21. This was most likely due to Mohawk’s strategic acquisition of Healing Solutions, a leading online seller of essential oils.

The acquisition is expected to bump MWK’s revenue upwards to around $340 million to $370 million, as indicated by Mohawk’s adjusted outlook for the 2021 financial year.

**Why MWK could be valuable:**

Mohawk has already made a number of acquisitions and plans to continue making more in the future.

Mohawk’s management never explained exactly why they acquired these brands but you can bet it was because AIMEE identified something in the company or the market that made Mohawk pull the trigger.

Mohawk’s acquisitions can become profitable fairly quickly too.

For example they acquired Healing Solutions at 3.8 times operating income, a surprisingly cheap multiple, but one that is normal when dealing with smaller CPG companies. If profits stay at these levels or grow, Mohawk will recoup all of its acquisition cost in just a few years.

Once they acquire these brands Mohawk also uses AIMEE to optimize sales and marketing in a more efficient manner to hit bigger revenue targets than what the company would do on its own.

Mohawk is able to rinse and repeat this strategy to keep boosting their net income.

Mohawk also sells its AIMEE software to other online sellers through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.

Revenue from the segment is currently only a tiny portion of Mohawk's overall business, but it has high margins and a huge market opportunity. For reference, there are over 2.5 million active sellers on Amazon alone that Mohawk can target with this software.

**What the risks are:**

Mohawk’s model relies heavily on Amazon’s platform to reach their customers. For now this isn’t an issue but there can be risks relying on one main source of traffic to their stores. If Amazon decides to make major changes to their algorithm or seller rules this could hurt Mohawk’s brands.

Their market cap is around $840 million and the stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 3.9, making the valuation a bit rich, but not overblown when considering what management believes long-term profit margins can get to.

If you believe in the growth of third-party sellers on Amazon and other e-commerce platforms and want to put your money behind it, Mohawk Group could be the best way to do that. The stock might be up over 400% in the past three months, but it is still early innings for this tech-enabled CPG conglomerate.

**Hims &amp; Hers Health ($HIMS)**

Summary:

* Hims makes it easy to order health products as well as speak to doctor's remotely using their platform.
* In late January 2021 Cathie Wood's ARK bought around 461 thousand shares in Hims giving investors a huge boost in optimism for the company.
* Hims was founded in 2017 and quickly hit $27 million in sales in their first year and are now on track to generate $179 million in 2021.
* They now have plans to expand into other ""telehealth friendly"" services as well as international markets.

**What they do:**

Hims is an internet pharmacy and telemedicine startup that went public via a S.P.AC  in late January 2021.**I analyzed 3 legit stocks that I found using different tools that track social mentions and sentiment data**

The company aims to help men (and women, thanks to a new expansion) save time, money, and the potential embarrassment of a doctor's appointment by delivering health products to customers' doorsteps, with no shipping costs.

These include prescriptions for erectile dysfunction, hair loss, skincare and anti-aging solutions, mental health services and even COVID-19 testing kits.

**Why they’re getting hype:**

According to Unbiastock.com, Reddit interest in Hims increased by 7244% when comparing February 2021 to the previous month.

This spike happened around the same time Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management disclosed an ownership position in the company adding \~461k shares to their portfolio.

For those who don’t know Cathie Wood a.k.a Aunt Cathie grew ARK’s assets by 11x in 2020 to $34.5b with their focus on innovative, high growth tech stocks. Her investment in Hims is a huge vote of confidence in the long term prospects of the company.

**Why HIMS could be valuable:**

The rise of the telehealth industry is one of the biggest megatrends that benefited from the global pandemic.

That’s not the only thing Hims has going for them. Their primary target market is millennials.

They’re well positioned to continue building up their market share in this still-young demographic, with the oldest millennials turning 40 this year and the youngest ones at 25 years old.

As millennials get older, they aren’t going to be satisfied with the “old school” healthcare model. So, Hims has the potential to capture the market now and hold onto it in the coming decades.

They’re also growing fast. After starting in 2017 they managed to hit $27 million in sales in their first year. They’re now projected to generate $179 million this year and $233 million in 2022.

Hims estimates that the telehealth industry could reach a $500 billion total addressable market. They also have plans to expand into other “telehealth friendly” markets with international expansion on the table as well.

**What the risks are:**

Healthcare startups including Hims and their competitor Roman have been criticized for making getting a prescription for hair loss treatments, ED pills, and beta blockers a little too cool — and possibly too easy.

They have been the subject of reports from Bloomberg, The New York Times, and other outlets questioning the ethics and legal implications of pushing prescription medication with very little (or no) oversight.

It’s possible Hims could find themselves in a regulatory battle similar to Uber or Airbnb as they continue to grow.

**Vuzix ($VUZI)**

Summary:

* Vuzix creates wearable VR/AR technology for consumers and businesses.
* Vuzix was another stock picked up by ARK who bought 292 thousand shares on 02/19/21.
* Vuzix already has several big name customers including Verizon and Clorox Co. Their technology is being used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare and telemedicine.
* Wall Street analysts are still bullish Vuzix has room to run despite surging over 500% during the past 12 months.

**What they do:**

Vuzix Corp is a supplier of smart glasses, AR technologies, and products for consumer and enterprise markets. Founded in 1997, Vuzix is one of the pioneers of AR, wearable computing, optics, and display engines.

While AR—alongside virtual reality (VR)—only became buzzwords in recent years, Vuzix has been delivering tech solutions to customers for more than 20 years.

**Why they’re getting hype:**

Reddit interest in Vuzix has surged by more than 17000% in February alone according to Unbiastock.com.

Vuzix was also recently snapped up by ARK who added 292k shares to their ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF ($ARKQ) on 02/19/21.

Even though they’ve already surged over 500% in the past 12 months, analysts are bullish Vuzix still has more room to run as the adoption of AR technology becomes more mainstream.

**Why VUZI could be valuable:**

AR and VR are usually associated with gaming.

But you won’t find a Vuzix-branded gaming headset. Instead, the company is mostly known for providing AR head-mounted displays in the form of smart glasses. These products have enjoyed increasing adoption in the enterprise and health-care world.

For example, smart glasses can help with barcode scanning, order picking, and fulfillment in warehouses. In the manufacturing industry, they can facilitate work instructions, step confirmation, and quality assurance.

For field services, smart glasses enable remote support. Thanks to their lightweight design and flexible hardware, Vuzix’s smart glasses are ideal for use in health care and telemedicine.

Although Vuzix is not a big-name company, they already have many big-name customers.

Some notable examples include Verizon ($VZ) who are working with Vuzix to co-develop a 5G-enabled smart glasses emergency medical service (EMS) solution and Clorox Co ($CLX) have started using “Vuzix M400” smart glasses to address the operational challenges brought upon by COVID-19.

**What the risks are:**

It’s still early days for Vuzix. Their current share price has already priced in big expectations on their future profits.

Five-star rated Wall Street analyst Jack Vander Aarde still thinks they have a lot of room to run “we believe it would be reasonable for VUZI to trade at a premium to peers, based on our view that VUZI is well-positioned for multi-year revenue growth of 100%+ (which we consider rare).""

“We believe its commercially ready technology and product portfolio is ahead of competitors, which we expect to result in VUZI having a dominant share of the nascent and rapidly expanding AR/VR wearables market.”

If you want to bet on the future of AR and VR technology Vuzix could be a great opp.

SLUT_STRANGLER,0.0,172.0,"You can look at their books, but I believe it’s difficult to make an informed decision about $RBLX without some experience with the website and games themselves. Here are some of my thoughts from being an active member since 2007. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the platform.

Roblox has been available to the public since 2006; you’re not investing in a new up &amp; coming company. It’s been around for 16 years, which is very long for an online game. That in itself is a good sign, but its potential and success is pretty cemented as of now. The lack of worldwide reach (with the majority of users being from North America) is worrisome, but there may be room for growth.

They recently reached over a billion registered users, and are currently sitting at 2.4 billion. The daily active user (DAU) count is somewhere around 30 million. Thus, the vast majority of registered users are inactive users or bots who prey on dumb kids to steal their account info via cookies. Their security and captcha, to summarize, sucks.

Roblox itself is a game client, but the website houses a variety of games made by users, of varying quality. There are some real gems but some real garbage as well. The front page cycles the same popular games and not a lot of up-and-coming ones. I can imagine it would be quite difficult to break into the algorithm if you’re not already a popular developer. Some people use/pay for bots to pump up their game’s likes and user count. This is obviously against the site's TOS, but it’s difficult to get ahead unless you pour hundreds into on-site ads.

Years ago, they shut down the forum, which contributed to a lot of helpful and insightful on-site discussion. They did so because they believed it was becoming difficult to moderate. Hire more moderators? That on top of the fact that the chat filter (both on-site and in-game) is becoming increasingly overbearing, it’s difficult to hold a conversation on the website, let alone form a tight-knit community. I feel a community is **essential** to the success of a social game platform like this one; right now, it feels like a soulless, barren corporate wasteland, compared to what it was before. Take a look at their [logo change](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Roblox-Logo-History.jpg), which summarizes the company’s new ethos well. There’s the argument that the chat filter needs to be overbearing because of the possibility of online predators - which is true - but there’s a difference between overbearing and broken. Sometimes, every second word is censored, even completely innocent ones.

Their customer support is pretty dismal. Not much else to say here, but I’ve personally dealt with it, and unless you are asking something really basic that can be answered by looking at the FAQ, they’re not much help. Just your typical outsourced copy &amp; paste replies. When it comes to accidental moderation resulting in bans or account deletion, or account theft, they’re not very helpful. I’ve had an account made in 2010 deleted in 2016 for something I did not do (account theft; the account itself was stolen) and they were no help.

Years ago as well, the “free” currency Tickets were removed, leaving the premium one, Robux. Tickets were awarded on daily login and could be used to purchase cosmetics and such. Now, join any game and almost every avatar you see is the default one because the vast majority of kids aren’t paying for the premium membership which gives you monthly Robux, nor are they paying for Robux itself.

Thus, parent’s wallets are the limiting factor on how much Roblox can grow, because a lot of the older base such as myself shares the same sour sentiment regarding the website as a whole. Even newer users are seen calling for the “glory days” of Roblox to come back, which is odd since they themselves did not experience those “glory days”. That being said, the general community sentiment seems that not many people are happy with the site in its current state, which makes me wonder if it’s current young user base is sustainable or if Roblox depends on cycling generations of kids and isn’t really capable of building an older following in its current state.

Moving on, there’s a thriving black market for Robux and limited cosmetic items because of the aforementioned poor on-site economy. The cosmetics catalog used to have sales for holidays like Black Friday and Memorial Day. These are no longer a thing as of the last few years, which seems like a simple enough thing to do to keep Robux flowing in the economy, but they refuse to do so. (??)

Speaking of site-wide events, celebrations like a yearly Egg Hunt, events which were dear to many users, are no more. Instead, they are replaced with corporate promotional events. These don’t yield independent games made by Roblox themselves like the Egg Hunt; instead, independent developers are “contracted” to shimmy these elements into their games. Doesn’t make for a very memorable experience, and I don’t know if the microtransactions yielded are any higher than they were for the previous events.

The search function on the website is pretty broken; for example, if you search the cosmetics catalog for “Adidas hoodie”, that can net you “ADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS” named items that may not be a hoodie or relevant to what you’re looking for at all, just something that’s spammed the tag you searched for. This has been the case for years and no attempt to remedy it is evident.

Recently, user-generated content (UGC) has been introduced to the cosmetics catalog, in which approved users can upload hats and other cosmetics rather than just Roblox themselves as before. One of the only good features introduced in the last few years in my opinion, but as a result, Roblox itself has essentially stopped making any cosmetics themselves.

Basically, with the content creation almost exclusively done by independent users and developers, the site now runs itself. As a result, it feels the platform has been stagnating creatively for years. Beyond updating the game client, it’s not really clear what (if anything) Roblox does behind the scenes to promote growth. There’s a lot of very simple improvements and features that could be introduced to satisfy the user base and maintain the appeal to kids and the older audience, but Roblox seems to be reluctant to do so for some reason. For instance, it’s weird that users are begging for on-site sales, which are such a cornerstone of almost any business, or site events, which should be essential as a social game platform. This makes me worry they are forgetting that their user base made them successful in the first place. In short, it doesn’t seem to have the exponential growth it saw from 2007 to the early/mid-2010s, which is worrisome as the platform as a whole is not doing a good job at creating a loyal user base.

All that being said, this is my perspective of a player. I hope a developer can chime in with their thoughts on the pros and cons of developing on Roblox, what their Robux income looks like, and how that translates into real-world currency.",stocks,Thoughts from my personal experience with Roblox over the past 15 years,172.0,0.92

(Not directly bullish) -The gaming market and streaming market are up from 2020. \[5\]\[6\]

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corsair has bad fundementals, however I believe this move into streaming is a good one. Targetting people who want to become streamers and selling corsair products is a great way to increase profits within the companies attmosphere. Corsair's CEO expressed interest in streaming boot camps and training. If heading into this direction, Corsair can eat up Chinese market share when looking to create stablized boot camps to create streamers. If Corsair does go in this direction they can create a new revenue source by contracting the streamers they trained, taking a percentage of their profits and advertising Corsair products to the audience.

I see a lot of people compare Corsair to Logitech $LOGI which is fair until you realize that Corsair is more than just a gaming accessories company. They create computers and buy software related to streaming. Logitech is a company that makes products for gamers and trational companies and consumers while Corsair focuses on gamers and now streamers. This difference seems small until you realize that Corsair doesn't have a real direct competitor.

The blue ocean strategy approach Corsair has taken to be able to cement themselves into the gaming community will pay off 10 fold in the future. I believe that Corsair will be synonyms with gaming and gaming culture making it worth more because of the brand rather than the fundemental book value.

I believe that paying anywhere $38.50 - $42.60 per share is a good investment for **short-term** investors. As a **long-term** investor buying in at any price will pay off in 5 to 10 years.

Corsair Gaming has a lot to offer and I am excited to see where it goes in the future.

dig000,0.0,162.0,"I've always loved Honda cars, and recently took a position in HMC after looking over their financials.

When you look at their financials, and how that relates to their stock price, it's pretty amazing that they aren't trading *way* higher. I should disclose that this is using the year data ending 3/31/20 for HMC (I know, a bit old, but you'll see why it doesn't really matter):

Current Market Price: $29.17

Book Value per Share: $43.19

PE Ratio: 5.04

Market Value divided by Book Value: 0.68

2020 Estimated Shipped Cars: 4.5M

Gross Profit: $29.1B

Let's just stop for a second after those figures. The one metric that is truly astounding is HMC is trading *below* it's book value. Honda is one of the largest automotive and motorcycle manufacturers in the world, aside from other products, and yet it trades below its book value. Call me crazy, but even if all it did was reach its book value, you would see a 48% upside. That's already good enough for me.

Now let's talk PE ratio. The current S&amp;P500 PE ratio is right around 40, give or take a bit on when you calculate it out. That's definitely high compared to historical numbers, and there are a whole host of reasons for that that I won't get into. The average S&amp;P500 PE ratio for the past twenty years is 24.9, and its just above 20.1 for the past ten years. With that in mind, HMC's PE ratio of 5 is laughably low. Even if it gets to the S&amp;P500 ten year average PE ratio, which wouldn't even be high by any standard, you're looking at a 298% increase in share price.

Alright, so we're already looking at easy upside from those two metrics, let's slap on another one for good measure - market value/book value. As I mentioned before, you're looking at a 48% upside if the stock price just gets to it's book value. Here's the thing - many stocks these days, including HMC's competitors trade well above their book value. Toyota, for instance, trades at about a 2.6 market/book ratio. If Honda did that, it's share price would be $112.65 right now. Honestly, that seems far more reasonable than where it's at now.

So, even with just those few metrics, it seems clear that Honda is massively undervalued, but it's fun to compare it to the all-scary monster of a stock, TSLA. Take a look at those same metrics and figures again:

Current Market Price: $29.17 vs TSLA at $798.15

Book Value per Share: $43.19 vs TSLA at $24.04

PE Ratio: 5.04 vs TSLA at 1246.88

Market Value divided by Book Value: 0.68 vs. TSLA at 33.19

2020 Shipped Cars: 4.5M (est) vs. TSLA at 500k

Gross Profit: $29.1B vs. TSLA at $6.6B

That's right, HMC has a higher book value than TSLA, and not by some measly margin. TSLA's astounding PE ratio is just outright scary, and that's the type of information that makes Michael Burry's short of TSLA not so crazy, even if he does have a price target of $100 (nearly a 90% loss). That doesn't stop me from having TSLA shares though, which brings me to my next point.

Investor sentiment seems to mean more than anything right now, and HMC has none. It only takes a quick look at trade volume in the last 6 weeks to see that:

TSLA: 925M vs. HMC: 20.2M

My view on sentiment is that it has a lot of power, and sentiment generally sticks for companies that are going places. In my mind it's partly what drove AMZN and TSLA share prices to such insane levels, and not to mention GME. If you look at the 5-year chart for HMC you don't see much sentiment at all. HMC is a safe haven, and seemingly forever a stock that you could sell Iron Condors on just picking up cash. That could all change if people start to catch on that HMC is primed and ready to do *whatever the f it wants* with the $25B it has in cash.

So, here's where I stand. Getting to $43 (book value) would be a correction. Getting to $108 would make it on par with market and similar to Toyota, which I could also view as a correction. If it catches investor sentiment, well, buckle up.

**TL;DR: HMC is massively undervalued by any metric. Upside of at least 50%-300% is more than reasonable, it would be a correction. Comparing it to TSLA is hilarious. Solid financials priming it ready to make moves and catch investor sentiment.**

I’m not really seeing much inflows into any other asset type. The money just seems to be.... out of the markets. The whole “there is an alternative” theory doesn’t make sense because if people were buying bonds, rates wouldn’t be rising.

And if inflation is the main fear driving the sell off, why are precious metals selling off?

Here's a few we've been considering (let me know if any of these sound interesting):

1. **Sentiment Analysis scanner** \-- users can run a quick sentiment analysis on any stock symbol, company, or topic. I also think it would be useful to compare multiple stocks side-by-side using this. It might also be useful to see which stocks have a correlation between sentiment and stock price over time.
2. **Trading bot designer** \-- users can design and run a trading bot without needing to code. Basically, you could drag and drop logic blocks to build a custom trading algorithm. Each algorithm will observe technical indicators and output signals. Then you can run the bot and get email alerts / text alerts when a buy/sell signal gets generated.
3. **Portfolio builder** \-- users can select stocks and see where their portfolio is weak or risky and get recommendations on how to improve it based on things like MPT. I also want to see option-based portfolios which incorporate strategies like covered-calls and bull-put spreads.

Anyways, let me know what you think -- we'll probably build something no matter what (since it's fun to make web apps) but really we hope it ends up being useful for everyone as well.

nafizzaki,0.0,158.0,"Wrote this for wsb, but it also goes here, I guess.

TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. Just for clarification, there is lots of asset inflation, for example, bonds are very inflated.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return(just like Munger said) in this decade, yet I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to a stranger on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man!

Edit: My post couldn’t have been more timely! Warren Buffett has warned quite clearly in his annual letter about the ""bleak future"" for debt investors.

“Fixed-income investors worldwide — whether pension funds, insurance companies or retirees — face a bleak future,” he wrote. “Competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons, must focus on bonds. And bonds are not the place to be these days.”

I always had a wide range of posts on my feed with different quality posts. Before the whole GME ordeal I actually found most of the subs to be at least 30 percent quality posts on an average day, with stocks being more close to around 60 percent. These are based on the top threads I would look at when browsing the subreddit. 

Nowadays stocks seems to be going through a ""DD renassaince"" where people are posting DD about any company that catches their eye.

I have a few suggestions for the mods but of course they aren't perfect, I'm just brainstorming. 

1. Several flairs will require character limits. We don't need three paragraph DD's, or constant speculation without discussion. I think any flair relating to a company or industry should have a minimum of 10,000 characters. Mods can play around with the character limits but if someone can't even make up that much which in alll honestly is a 5 min read on an average blog page, then they aren't looking for a discussion. They are creating an ad. 
2. There should be a new rule that every DD, must include at least ONE negative thing about the company in which they are talking about, whether it be debt, competition etc. Perfect unicorn companies are once in a blue moon. EVERY company has faults, the point is how they deal with those faults and overcome them. 
3. There should be weekly megathreads to contain discussion of whatever stock of the week there is.

kayaarr,0.0,147.0," JAC Motor said Thursday it signed a letter of intent today with $NIO Holdings Ltd. to set up a joint venture.

The company, to be located in Hefei, is tentatively named Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing Technology (Anhui) Co (江来先进制造技术(安徽)有限公司). The name takes the first character of JAC's Chinese name and the second character of NIO's Chinese name.

The company plans to have a registered capital of 500 million yuan ($77 million ), with JAC contributing 51 percent and NIO 49 percent.

The company's board of directors will consist of five directors, three to be appointed by JAC and two by NIO. The chairman will be appointed by JAC and the vice chairman will be appointed by $NIO.

The joint venture will build a new ecology of ""advanced manufacturing + industrial internet"" with automation, networking and platform, relying on industrial internet and manufacturing management experience, JAC said.

The purpose of the joint venture is to integrate the advantages of JAC and NIO in manufacturing, production operation, quality control, supply chain management, to serve the manufacturing operation of products scientifically, JAC said.

The business scope of the joint venture includes manufacturing, R&amp;D and sales of electric vehicles and components; supply chain management; technical consulting and personnel training related to intelligent electric vehicles.

JAC emphasizes that the letter of intent for the joint venture is not legally binding and does not constitute an offer, and the two sides strive to agree and sign a formal agreement as soon as possible.

# This is the latest move by NIO to try to enter the lower-priced EV market with a new brand, and it looks more promising than any previous moves.

In April 2017, NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Changan Automobile, planning to set up a joint venture to develop new products together. The agreement at the time noted that the cooperation was different from JAC NIO's OEM model.

On August 17, 2018, the joint venture company Changan NIO was officially settled in Nanjing Jiangning Development Zone, with William Li, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO as chairman of Changan NIO and Li Wei, executive vice president of Changan Automobile, as vice chairman.

In December 2017, GAC Group and NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement, and in April 2018, GAC NIO was officially established.

However, so far, Changan NIO has not yet presented any new vehicle plans or clear development plans.

## Bearish Arguments

**Head to Head:**

\- NEM beats KGC by 16.71% in shares held by institutions.

\- NEM beats KGC by 0.03 in debt to equity ratio. 

\- NEM beats KGC by 5 in ESG risk rating

**Company/Stock:**

\- Kinross Gold's debt to equity ratio is significantly higher than the metal mining industry's average debt to equity ratio. This could be explained by the sharp increase in production (linked to gold prices appreciating) and choosing to take on debt to finance operations \[15\]\[17\]\[20\].

\- Kinross Gold's share price has dropped 29.5% in the last 6 months \[5\].

\- Kinross Gold performs very poorly among its competitors for its carbon footprint \[21\].

\- Kinross Gold performs poorly among its competitors for its water conservation \[21\].

\- Share price is below 20 and 200 MA (bearish signal for some, bullish for others).

**Market:**

\- Gold price decreased by 10% in the past 6 months and 5% in the past 30 days \[20\].

\- In 2020, global gold production fell by 5.2%. In 2019, global gold production fell by 1% (first time since 2008) \[24\].

\- *""Based on known reserves, estimates suggest that gold mining could reach the point of being economically unsustainable by 2050, though new vein discoveries will likely push that date back somewhat."" ""...It is unlikely that large-scale gold mining will continue past 2075 without either huge mining technology advances or the discovery of currently unknown massive gold deposits""* \[22\].

\- *""Gold mining can significantly alter the natural environment. For example, gold mining activities in tropical forests are increasingly causing deforestation along rivers and in remote areas rich in biodiversity.""*  \[23\].

## Bullish Arguments

**Head to Head:**

\- KGC beats NEM by 62.4% in 12 month price change.

\- KGC beats NEM by 9.77 in PE ratio.

\- KGC beats NEM by 0.74 in P/B ratio.

**Company/Stock:**

\- Kinross Gold's projected revenue of $4.6B for 2021 is 2.4x higher than current total debt of $4.2B and has the potential to decrease the company's debt to equity ratio, moving it closer to the industry's average \[13\]\[15\].

\- Kinross Gold has seen significant gains in net income in the past 3 years, growing by 5788.14% \[11\].

\- Kinross Gold's share price has grown 56.6% in the last 12 months \[5\].

\- Kinross Gold's stock has a low short % of shares (1.19%) outstanding with a high % of shares held by institutional investors (67.4%) \[3\].

\- Kinross Gold announced in September 2020 that the dividend would be reinstated. Management has displayed confidence in the near- to mid-term by restarted dividend payments. Based on current production projections, the payments are expected to continue until 2023 \[25\].

\- Kinross Gold's updates on development projects, exploration and mineral reserves, and resources show successful signs of progress with no delays. The company reported extensions of mine life at several sites as well as an expansion of mineral reserves \[27\]. 

\- Kinross Gold has an EPS growth of 44%, compound, over the last three years \[28\].

\- Kinross Gold is JP Morgan's ‘top pick in the gold sector,’ rated as Overweight (i.e., a Buy) \[29\]. 

\- Kinross Gold has beaten analysts earning estimates the last 4 quarters \[30\].

\- Average analyst recommendation rating is a Buy with an average analyst price target at $12,08 \[13\].

\- Kinross Gold is a top performer among its competitors for its pollution prevention, workplace health and safety, and diversity of corporate leadership \[21\].

\- Kinross Gold performs well among its competitors for its employee satisfaction and pay and corporate governance \[21\].

\- Kinross Gold has shared new plans and renewed commitment to decrease carbon footprint and water conservation \[31\]\[32\] 

**Market:**

\- Investing in a growing gold company can act as leverage to the price of gold. When gold appreciates, gold mining companies can increase their production and grow revenues. The price of gold has increased substantially by 561% over the past 20 years, 36% in the past 5 years, and 5.8% in the last 12 months. This has provided smaller mining companies like Kinross with the leverage they need to grow their sales \[11\]\[20\].

\- There's a general weak US dollar outlook, especially once COVID worries subside. Gold is a good hedge against inflation when the value of the dollar falls \[33\].

\- 7.5% of worldwide demand for gold comes from the consumer technology industry. As the industry grows, demand for gold will grow with it, driving up the price. Consumer technology is projected to generate $2.06 trillion in 2023, compared to $1.69 trillion in 2019 \[34\]\[35\].

\- Gold is widely regarded as a good hedge against economic turbulence and uncertainty, and is therefore considered a recession-proof investment.

\- Global gold production is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021 \[36\].

Redditor45643335,0.0,141.0,"I know many people had money during 2020, saw the crash but thought it was going lower so they didn't buy in. Then when it started going up they still didn't buy because they missed the bottom or they became convinced a second crash was coming and the lows would be revisited and they'll have their chance to buy.

Well we know how that turned out.. they might just be thinking this recent correction is *the* infamous second crash they've been predicting all these months.

I know there's a lot of uncertainty going on in the markets recently and you'll find plenty of doom and gloom stock market articles on the internet if you look for them.. You might be looking at this recent correction combined with reading doom and gloom headlines and gleefully rubbing your hands thinking to yourself ""I knew my time would come, now I just need to wait a little bit more and then I'll buy, probably close to the bottom"".

But this will almost certainly be a terrible mistake, and it would be the same terrible mistake you made last time. I get it, psychologically you want to buy at the cheapest possible price so you get the biggest return AND you lower your downside loss potential. It's very attractive and the temptation to try and time the market sucks you in, you become so fixated on not losing money and buying the cheapest price that you end up never making money either because you never pluck up the courage to actually buy in the first place.


---

I have a friend who pulled his money out of the S&amp;P in 2008 at around the 1000 point market (a 30% loss) to try and buy in lower, and while the market did in fact go lower, he was unable to time the bottom because he waited too long and was too greedy. To this day he still has not bought back in... Not because he thinks the price is going back to 1000, but because he is so bitter that he made this mistake he just cannot bring himself to pay the now 250% - 300% increased price.

At first he waited, then he waited some more and after a few years he lost interest because the price was so much higher than when he sold, especially when the price went past the previous ATH, he completely gave up on the stock market as being a viable investment and instead put his money in a savings account. I've not seen or spoken to him for a few years but I know him, there's no way he would have bought into the market, he was too bitter.


So what's the moral of this story / rant? Don't be like my old friend... Don't try to time the bottom. Don't be greedy. Just accept the discount that's on offer and buy in, then if it drops more, buy some more using your salary. Because if you don't, you're very likely to be stuck in the perpetual cycle of waiting for a correction that you end up inevitably missing the timing anyway. 


And I know there are some people who will read this, or posts like it, and they'll tell themselves they are right and they can time the bottom but however strong your conviction, just know that you are almost certainly going to miss the bottom, so why bother trying?",stocks,"If you were one of those people who sat on the sides throughout 2020 because you missed the bottom, do not make the same mistake twice!",141.0,0.92

""Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others  are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try  to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical  analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which  measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to  be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  

In trading on  Thursday, shares of NIO Inc (Symbol: NIO) entered into oversold  territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.7, after changing hands as low  as $37.59 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the  S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is 41.2.

Stocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent sellof. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021’s gains. 

The moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. 

* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week.

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

As Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits.

“The first rule of investment is ‘buy low and sell high’, but many people fear to buy low because of the fear of the stock dropping even lower.

Floofyboy,0.0,127.0,"First of all, when you think about it, Nasdaq only lost 7% in a month. That means the huge majority of smart money is still holding and doesn't think there's a reason to panic. When smart money panics, you have the covid crash.


Secondly, its important to understand why there is so much red recently. The main reason is the fear due to the rising 10 year old treasury yield. When we woke up this morning, it did spike in a scary way, but now its going back down sharply, we are fine: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=^TNX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch


Now, even if this stupid 10 year old treasury yield did not go down, most people would agree these fears are irrational. Check this quick interview: https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/philadelphia-fed-harker-don-t-011809466.html


Historically, the rates, they go down, not up. The fear of massive interest rates are irrational, and as i said earlier, its only ~7% of people who are pulling out of nasdaq, that's a small number of people who's irrationally fearful. Feds have been under their target of 2% for a LONG time, they aren't concerned about this.


Additionally, Biden agreed to tighten the covid stimulus requirements. This is good news because it means its less likely to over heat the economy beyond control. And when that stimulus does get released, its hard to imagine it won't at least give a small boost to the markets.



I also think we need to look at the bright side. Historically, most crash happens when the market overheat. Corrections like we are having right now help avoid a real full breakdown of the market, and they help buy cheaper dips.

It's 1/8th the valuation of CHWY with very similar market shares (approx. 5-6%) and revenues ($4B-$5B range) as of the end of 2020. Chewy is definitely growing faster rn no doubt. However, the WOOF CEO started in 2018 and came from HPQ. He was definitely blindsided by the pandemic in orchestrating the turnaround. HPQ and its stock performed very well while he was el presidente, and it actually seems to have dropped quite a bit ever since he left. 

Long term debt is the elephant in the room, but the IPO will cover a portion of it (maybe 1/3), and a successful turnaround will take care of the rest. I like the omnichannel focus, the brick and mortar footprint (bc of in-store veterinary services) coming out of the pandemic, and a tech oriented CEO. If they can make big inroads with marketing and customer service (seems to be their biggest issues rn), they will be on equal footing with CHWY. Another small factor is that WOOF doesn't sell the trash pet food that CHWY does. Lots of other factors of course, but I like the stock and the opportunity for a turnaround. The $97B TAM means CHWY and WOOF combined only have like 10-12% of the marketshare, which leaves plenty of room for both CHWY and WOOF to thrive and not have to fight each other tooth and nail. 

Not as sexy as CHWY, but I think given CHWY's current valuation there is better risk/reward and upside for WOOF. Wish there were 2022/23 leaps available. Only goes out to September 2021 rn.

**Macro Upsides: Currency Recovery Play**

In January, the Real depreciated 33% vs. USD due to COVID risks prompting a flight to safety. For newbies, a ""flight to safety"" is when USD appreciates vs. everybody and JPY/Euro appreciate to a lesser extent vs. developing world currencies. This put a short-term squeeze on developing world businesses with global supply chains.

Why? The challenge for developing world businesses is that their ***income*** is derived from local currencies - in this case, Brazilian Real is the main one, but also CAD, Argentine peso, &amp; Chilean peso - but their ***costs*** are primarily derived from US Dollars, because international commodity contracts are denominated in US Dollars. So, if the company wants to buy sugar for soft drinks or barley for beer brewing, they pay in USD. But when they sell, they earn income in real or pesos. Currency pressure therefore puts pressure on profit margins.

Going forward, emerging market currencies should remain stable or appreciate vs. USD as vaccine rollouts continue; the real economy stabilizes; and institutional risk appetite normalizes. Coupled with Brazil's recent pension reforms and relatively strong financial picture in the banking sector, I find it highly likely the Real has bottomed-out and will appreciate in the intermediate term.

Note: This is my judgment, as someone who taught undergraduate development economic policy courses for a decade. There are competing opinions, which I discuss below and include in the sources.

* Credentials, for those who care: MA International Development 2009 (American University); PhD (ABD) @ UC San Diego).

(An aside: I am curious if newbies appreciate this kind of content. If so, **let me know in the comments or PM me** \- I'm likely starting an economic policy substack to help folks understand the broader picture on regulatory issues and such.)

**Monthly and Weekly Technicals:**

Trading at Long-Term trend support on the monthly chart. Monthly Trend Resistance is around $2.90-3.00.

Daily/Weekly charts have it in the middle of an upward channel trade, but still significantly below 2019 prices. Immediate support levels are at $2.77 and $2.50

Monthly resistance levels: $4.15, $5.15, and $6.00.

My current target is in the $4.50-$5.50 range.

**Downside risks:**

* Slightly declining market share in Alcoholic beverages sector to Heineken and Cervejara Petropolis. A lot of this due to Heineken's previous acquisition of Kirin, aggressive marketing, and the robust craft beer market in Brazil. This has led to increased marketing costs and a slightly declining operating margin. I consider this the most relevant critique. However, I think it is mitigated by multiple factors.  

   * The most recent filings from AmBev show expanding craft beer portfolio with solid growth in those brands.
   * AmBev still has a substantial moat at \~60% market share. Market share erosion is likely to subside given the dominant position.
   * Pressure from the downturn in the real and COVID will exert disproportionate pressure on smaller businesses. Given AmBev's rock-solid financial position and dominant market presence, this creates excellent brand acquisition opportunities.
* Potential currency risk from two things:  

   * Vaccine rollouts in South America being undermined by political actors, the most likely being Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Given Biden is US president, support from international development institutions, and elite desires to reopen, I find this fairly unlikely.
   * Currency risks may continue if vaccination proves a challenge or there is a new COVID surge. Again, I think fairly unlikely - the dominant likelihood is capital flows returning to emerging markets as vaccination rollouts continue.

shootermgavin_crypto,0.0,123.0," Hi all,

I was inspired by the choppy market action to do a write up on losing control when you trade. It's extracted from my blog (no self promote, no links or sneaky sheet), maybe it resonates with you:

It's about losing and regaining control on the holy grail of trading YOUR trading plan:

What Happens When we Lose Control.

I posted this in Daytrading but the exact same applies for investors or long term traders.

Many destructive emotions or situations stir up feelings associated with loss of control. **Some examples of what's happened to me in the past:**

*You buy a stock, it goes down, you sell it to avoid losing money and it literally goes back up the next second, so you jump back in and it goes down again!*

Essentially, you are trying to control whether or not you make money. The obvious problem here - **you don't control price.**

This is probably one of the most common root causes of over-trading. And comes down to a few things:

1. You do not have a trading plan that you understand
2. Emotions are acted on instantly
3. Fear is in the passenger seat and you are trying to gain control of your emotions
4. Your current system doesn't suit your personality

Trading is so full of paradoxes it would make you sick to your stomach, in fact, it does make some people literally sick to their stomach. The very need for control and our primitive brain  is basically wired to stop us from making money. Admitting we don't know where a stock will go is the first step to recovery, and a long road it is.

**Example 2 (Based on the above):**

*Holding onto losses in order to avoid the pain of ""loss"". There are many terms for this, for more info you can look into the disposition effect. Here we have the metamorphosis of a ""trader"", someone who always tells you when they are winning to an ""investor"", someone who holds shit stocks while they tank.*

Again, this ties into control (and ego) which quite frankly are like peas in a pod and feed from one another.

By trying to control the outcome of a trade, we find all sorts of ways to really fuck up our trading strategy in all sorts of creative ways. The very things we try to avoid, which in ""normal life can be easy"", in the stock market, are impossible. If your wife/husband asks you if you look fat, you can tell a white lie. If a stock goes down and you own it, no lie will bail you out.

The stock market doesn't give a shit about how much money we make or lose, it's totally objective. Therefore, saying it's ""rigged"" or ""manipulated"" is totally irrelevant because it is rigged for all of us with few exceptions.

What we Can't Control

The reality of trading in terms of control is simple. It's much better to avoid things we can't control as the energy expended in this way removes focus from what we can control.

Very easy to say but the long term impact will be successful trading or mediocre trading. As it turns out, we can't actually control the entire world - who would have thought! Some examples:

1. If a stock goes up or down
2. Black Swan events #Rona-19, 2008
3. How much the central bank prints or doesn't print
4. How governments will react to certain situations
5. Anything to do with the news
6. If country A decides to bomb country B
7. People (long term)
8. Interest rates

Ironically, the things outside of our control are what freak us out of positions, push us into making rash buying or selling decisions and trigger our fight or flight reactions and derail any half-decent trading plan.

I will openly admit I spend too much time on what I can't control. When it comes to people, stressful situations and even macro-economics. It is very hard to drown out the inputs from social media, friends, family and others. Even worse still is to avoid holding strong opinions on all of the

**So What Can we Control**

All is not lost though. If we could not control any variables in our stock market endeavors it would be pretty damn pointless to trade. The ingredients for success are truly found in the decisions we make in relation to:

1. When we buy a stock
2. When we sell a stock
3. What strategy we decide upon
4. Our environment
5. How much of whatever we buy or sell
6. The types of things we decide to watch, listen to and or read
7. The people we surround ourselves with
8. The daily habits we create around trading
9. Keeping a trading journal
10. Trading reviews

The significant difference between what we can and can't control is this little thing called **effort**.

It takes **significant effort** to find, test, understand and lose money when we start trading, the learning curve really can't be understated. Even worse, those who do well initially end up getting ruined because the precedent is set that ""this is easy"". That lack of experience always catches up, be it in stocks or any other pursuit. This is the Dunning Kruger effect in action.

Having logged my trades for a number of years, many patterns show up and repeat themselves most notably in times of duress. For me personally this included the following  - for which I now am 100% accountable.

1. Buying too soon, usually due to FOMO
2. Selling too soon, usually due to fear
3. Buying on tips from Twitter and friends - the worst of the worst, I still fall for this one
4. Not taking trades out of fear

These are just a few which were underpinned by one major theme: **not following my trading plan.**

Sure, I still have my days and even months where I have lost control of my process and am tired, sick of everything and slip up. Yes of course, it costs me money every time and if you think I have down days because of it - you are absolutely correct. The real difference now is I know where I am going wrong, that I can improve it and make serious money trading stocks in the long run. **I know what I can and can not control.**

It all starts with having a clear plan, a very understandable unambiguous trading system, tons of real trades and a meticulous journal to keep track of where you are winning and losing.

Over time, taking these lessons and reshaping habits, patterns and hang-ups to eventually become consistent and eventually have it down to a performance art.

The apex of these points is total control over what you do during the trading day, how you can manage your emotion and execute that trading plan. The ability to follow this plan and learn from will either create or destroy potential traders, especially in the long run.

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? 

- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? 

- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.


## The Fundamental Constraint

This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on fingerprinting. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank.

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

Now let me just go ahead and take the opinion here - I don’t think PayPal will achieve this in the US, but their investment in MercadoLibre might take them there in some way. Latin America is a particularly interesting case study in underbanking. The reason I hate this is because I feel that a lot of their services are disconnected and low-quality. For example, Remitly allows me to send money to Mexico in a highly informed and smooth way, while Xoom (a paypal remittance service) just about shits the bed the moment I touch it. Sure, that’s anecdote - but I want my investments going somewhere where the design is ALWAYS built around the customer. PayPal’s management resulting in the shipment of an unfinished and thoughtless product is just an awful red flag to me. I should not be getting unknown error alert when I send money to another country. 


# The Underbanked

Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted:

&amp;gt; “...to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. Twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet standard, like SMTP (email protocol). For a variety of reasons, all reasonable at the time, we took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter. But a lot’s changed over the years.”

Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and first-time entrepreneurs while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:

- Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy
- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth &amp;amp; culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

1. The ability to start a business
2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
3. The ability to invest and educate in bitcoin
4. The ability to save on basic purchases
5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

# Speculation

This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:

1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings.
2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.
4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with orgs like Visa or MasterCard.
5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
6. Square will foray into equal housing.

Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. 

Let's talk most recent timeline:

**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.

Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. 

**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. 

**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.

**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:

1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;amp;amp;V elements.
2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. 
3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)

Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. 

**Surviving to 2025:**

This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. 

Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.

There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. 

Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

**Beyond 2025:**

[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:

Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M

Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN

Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share
2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share
3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share

What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.

Let's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. 

If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. 

**Beyond 2030:**

**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**

The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.

1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.
2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.
3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.
4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.
5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.

**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**

While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.

**Let's Talk Technology:**

[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. 

Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. 

The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. 

In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

**Bear Case:**

1. What if it explodes?
   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.
2. SpaceX:
   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;amp;amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.
3. It is a hype driven stock:
   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**.

notouchmygnocchi,0.0,121.0,"There is a simple fallacy overlooked about the saying ""buy low, sell high."" It is the desired outcome, but it childishly misses the actual method/goal, which is to ""gain a +% change, and avoid a -% change.""

This subtle nuance has extremely important differences in how you make your trading decisions, because people who are only thinking in terms of ""buy low, sell high"" are likely to fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy where if they have bought in at a price and then realize that the price is trending down and likely will continue to trend down, they foolishly accept this -% change because they expect in some longer term the trend will reverse so that they can sell higher than they bought in.

However the smarter trader will recognize a downturn as an opportunity to sell before eating all that likely -% change. And will then buy back in when he believes the price will start increasing, thereby gaining all the recouped -% change that he avoided and stacking his future +% change on top of his previous sell price from before when he expected the price to go down.

In summary the question you need to ask yourself is ""Which is more likely, a price increase or a price decrease?"" And to trade accordingly to make the best and safest bets.

For example I've been seeing many people here foolishly complaining about having bought into stocks that ""became meme stocks"" because ""how dare people pump up the price of my long term investments so that I can get gains now that would have taken much longer, I'm not happy about this unsustainably high price that I got in on the ground floor of so I'm going to hold until the price goes back down and then I'm going to hold until my longterm profits eventually get the price up this far in a sustainable way."" Really great way to miss out on a lot of money. If you asked almost anybody yesterday about MJ stocks, they would tell you that the price was pumped and that it would crash soon, so the obvious conclusion to the smart person was to get out before losing from all that far more likely -% change rather than risk an unlikely further +% change. Going forward MJ is still expected to be a likely and high longterm +% change, so most people should be cautiously looking to see if the current floor holds or if it continues to bleed a further -% change before buying in on the anticipation of more +% change.

Another fallacy: ""Timing the market vs. Time in the market""

This is a false dichotomy, which favors the previously mentioned longterm ""sell high"" fallacy in ignorance of the actual ""gain +% change and avoid -% changes"" The correct method is always to do both as best you can. If you invest during a high stock market, wait 10 years and then check your investments, it won't matter how long you've been in the market if you miss-timed a longterm play and are currently in a market crash which are typical due to typical large ebb/flow economic trends.

""gain +% change and avoid -% changes"" do this for as much as you are able, if you day trade, sell when you expect it will go down and buy when you expect it will go up. If you swing trade look at the broader trends of news and the price history and buy when you expect it to go up, sell when you expect it to go down. If you're a longterm investor look at the company's fundamentals and buy those that are undervalued and will go up.

Some of The best plays are those that combine expected long term +% change and expected short term +% change for reduced likelihood of unexpected dips and more +% change opportunities.

Ultimately the future prices are probabilistic and may often not match your expectations and you will often miss out on trade opportunities, you just need to keep trying to make the plays that will net you the best +% changes, and if you make good decisions you should average positive % gains.

&amp;#x200B;

Other things: absolute price#/stock#/etc. are mostly arbitrary, except for their implications with meaningful metrics like market cap. It is mostly irrelevant to you how many shares you bought, what price it is, etc. all that matters is what proportion of your funds have you invested, what % change do you expect the stock to undergo in the future, and how quickly do you expect it to happen.

Utilizing outside normal hours volatility gains/spikes is often a great time to sell (which is why retail investors are sidelined from trading then by most brokers, can't have a level playing field or the house wouldn't always win), afternoon lows are frequently great buying points and decently reliable.",stocks,Understanding The Stock Market (Todays MJ APHA/TLRY etc. example),121.0,0.9

I believe, in a time like this, a lot of people need a fresh glass of some ice cold water...

# Splashed right into their faces.

Tl;dr Ape explanation: I want GME to moon, but I am concerned about people being fed false information. 1. The claim Melvin said they didn't close their short position at the hearing is a lie. Their opening statement specifically had them saying they DID close it. 2.  The strategy of ITM calls boosting the price was tested last time &amp; failed last time. These are covered calls. 3. There isn't enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding. The profit comes when HF close positions, but you won't know that happened until it's over.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to see GME rocket to the moon. And I believe there is a scenario where that can be possible. But I want to go over the popular scenarios that will deceive you into believing THEY are the scenarios that will lead you to the moon. This is not a bear post against GME. This is reality.

* This is for those of you newcomers who thought you missed out on the last GME wave.
* This is for those of you who were stuck holding the bag last time (me, included) and are looking at profiting from this time to make that money back.
* This is for those of you who just didn't learn your lesson, and need a reminder of what went down last time.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, there are scenarios where GME can be squeezed. But what scenario is that? And what scenarios are not that?

&amp;#x200B;

1. First thing first, I want to stop a lie that I have seen spread like wildfire. The blatant lie that Melvin Capital, during the Gamestop hearing, admitted to not closing out their short position on Gamestop. This is not true. Now, I am going to assume whoever came up with this lie, did it as a *valiant* effort to help boost the price of Gamestop, and probably hoped no one would call them out on their BS, because nobody else decided to waste their time, watching a 5+ hour congressional hearing about stocks. Those are about the two most boring things in the world, combined. But, you don't even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the BS that it is. In Melvin Capital's opening statement, within the first minute of it, they state they closed out of their short positions in GME days before any restrictions were put on it. You can look up videos of the opening statements, yourself. I won't baby you that much. So, in conclusion, don't rely on the scenario that Melvin never closed out their short positions. It's a lie and it needs some water doused on it.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Scenario Two, possibly the most believed strategy on GME Thursday/Friday: ""Keeping the price over **(insert dollar amount here),** by Friday close, makes **(insert number here)** of calls ITM, and when they cover, the price is going to rocket!"" Now, I am not going to say this scenario is impossible, but it is not very likely, and it is what got many people burned the last time. Yes, it is true, keeping the price over a certain price, making a lot of calls ITM, can be good for the stock... **IF** those calls aren't covered calls, which I believe that almost all of them are. The week ending Jan. 22nd, there are probably a lot of naked calls. That hurt the sellers, bad, when GME closed at a very high price. Nobody expected it. That helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike. But then, let's run down what happened that following week. Yes, RH restricted buying on Thursday, 28th, which I do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed, but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the ""Calls ITM"" strategy that followed. That Thursday, the price plummeted into the $200s. That Friday, you heard a lot of chatter of ***""As long as we can get the stock up to $310, a lot of calls will be ITM and we will be golden, my fellow apes! Get it to $320 and that's bonus points. That will be 90k calls that will be ITM and have to cover. That's 9 MILLION SHARES!""*** And yeah, A lot of that was true. There were 90k calls that would be ITM if we closed above $320. And you know what we did? We closed above $320. We closed around $328, in fact. This was it. Come Monday, that price was going to the moon. *""10k isn't a meme!""* We chanted. We couldn't be wrong. We did the maths. We had the DD. Diamonds don't crack, baby! Well, come Monday, there was no lift off. It was the Space Shuttle Columbia all over again. The stock fell, and it fell hard. Going back into the low $200s, dipping into the $100s even, before closing in the $200s. That's okay though. That's fine. They had until Wednesday to *actually* close on those Calls, you'd hear. So Tuesday came and went. Then Wednesday too. We never saw $300 again. In fact, by Friday, we were barely even seeing $100. So what happened? What went wrong? We had maths **AND** anime on our side. Well, what I believe happened is, those Call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended Jan. 22nd, when they got screwed. They didn't let their calls be naked the following week. They bought up GME stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week, if they didn't already have them. This allowed them to resell those stocks at $320 and under, making them the big winners in all of this. But that meant these weren't NEW stocks that would help us go higher. No, these were stocks bought on the way up. They helped us peak but wouldn't help us go ***over*** the peak. So, when those calls executed, there were suddenly a lot of new holders of GME stock. Holders who saw their stocks were worth $300-$320. These weren't diamond handers, like you or I. These apes wanted their bananas ***NOW.*** So they sold when they got them. Gotta cash in those profits at some point. As WSB loves saying ""*You can't lose if you don't sell""*. Well, you also can't win if you don't sell. So now flash forward a month later, and the same theory is being pushed. ""*Keep the price over $100 and we will rocket to $800 come Monday. No, scratch that, $1000. No, wait, even better. $69,420!""* You hear in the echo chamber, bouncing off the walls like GME does in the first 30 minutes of market open. That's not going to happen. These are covered calls that are ITM. You're not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price. You are just buying stocks for $50-$100 that were already bought at $40-$60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant. And none of this is even mentioning that the amount of ITM calls this time is like a third of what it was last time. So, do not rely on this strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Scenario Three: *""tHeY hAvE tO cOveR. tHeN wE cAn sEt oUR oWn pRicE""*. This is probably the most ignorant reason, and is why I typed it out like that. Yeah, I'm mocking you. Get over it. it is true, they do have to cover eventually. But not with your stocks. GME short interest is somewhere around 45-50% (too lazy to relook up the actual number), and this is after new reports showed 1.3 million more shares were shorted on Wednesday. Now, yes, that is a high amount of short interest. But that isn't high enough for the **""Diamond Hands""** approach. There's still 50ish percent of shares out there, not shorted. And yes, Diamond Handers hold a lot of those, most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money, not the message. They see a 3x profit? They sell. They sell to whoever is willing to buy. Could be more Diamond Handers, could be hedge funds. But eventually, Apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with. That's when the Hedge Funds can swoop in, buy up these stocks, cover their short positions. The people they borrowed from might not be Diamond Handers, and end up selling to more Hedge Funds. When the short interest is only around 50%, you can't win with the Buy/Hold strategy. When the short interest is 50%, the short squeeze happens and you don't know it happens until it is over and the Hedge Funds have covered. You win by riding the wave up as Hedge Funds cover and then you get out near the top. That's the end of your ride. The ride doesn't just keep going up. You can only set the price when you own most of the market, and in this case, we don't. And on top of all of that, you also have people who are doing this with their bill money. The 1st of the month is coming up, that's a lot of rent needing paid. No shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills. But, that's more shares that will flood the market. Probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there, but pennies add up to dollars eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

And those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning. Again, I cannot stress this enough: I **DO** believe a short squeeze can happen with GME. But I do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen. I'm just tired of seeing people being fed these these  delusional optimistic claims that throw truth, history, and **REAL** DD &amp; common sense out the window, treating GME more like a pump n dump than an actual short squeeze.  it's okay to drink the Kool-aid, but maybe check to make sure it isn't spiked first.",stocks,A Slap Back to Reality,126.0,0.71

rareliquid,0.0,126.0,"Hello! Below is some diligence on Fastly, one of the innovators of the CDN / edge computing space. TDLR and resources used at the bottom.

**What are CDNs and Edge Computing?**

* Before I get into Fastly, I first need to set the stage by defining CDNs and Edge Computing (or else the rest of the post is confusing)
* **CDNs are defined as a group of servers that help deliver Internet content,** so even this Reddit post you’re reading right now is delivered to you through a CDN
   * To put it simply, all else being equal, a good CDN will help something like a web page load really fast while a bad CDN will be slow and cause noticeable lag
* **Edge Computing is a relatively new term born out of CDNs** and is a field in which Fastly is one of the primary innovators
   * For the average person, it may seem like digital data can be transmitted instantaneously, but in actuality, the farther away servers are to a user, the more time it takes for digital data to travel, compute, and be stored
   * **Edge computing brings computation and data storage as close to the user as possible through small, distributed data centers placed all over the world**
      * It also allows for a lot of the data processing to happen on edge devices, like smartphones
   * To really hammer this home, imagine having to travel to Texas every time your car needed gas instead of just traveling to your nearest gas station
      * That’s the difference between how data used to be processed (traveling to Texas = data traveling to a few, faraway data centers) to what edge computing now provides (nearest gas station = closest edge server or devise)
   * [Here’s a visual representation I find helpful](https://cbi-research-portal-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/01/08144511/Edge-Computing-Graphic-768x432.png)

**The History of Fastly**

* Fastly was founded by Artur Bergman in 2011. He was previously the CTO at Wikia. Artur became frustrated with the capabilities of CDNs around 2010 due to the long wait times it took for updates and the constant reliance on slow technical support.
   * Artur believed he could create a better solution and thus founded Fastly and the company branded itself around CDNs until about 2017, when references to CDNs were replaced with moving computing to the edge
* What’s important to know is that from its early beginnings, **Fastly’s team had a fundamentally different mindset and a custom-built approach** that know gave the company an edge
* Here are 3 notable differentiators:
   * **1) Silverton - Fastly’s customized distributed routing agent**
      * In its beginnings, the Fastly team first examined approaches to handling networking traffic into and out of their Points of Presence, or POPs, which are a collection of devices that store data that CDNs can pull from to quickly deliver content
      * Instead of using standard, off-the-shelf equipment, Fastly purchased Arista switches that allowed them to run their own software aka Silverton which gave Fastly more control over traffic routing and thus leading to better content delivery
      * This also saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars for each POP deployed
      * But more importantly, software can be changed while hardware cannot, which means that over time, Silverton becomes better and a stronger competitive edge
   * **2) Less but more powerful POPs**
      * Most legacy CDN companies like Akamai have invested into hundreds or thousands of small POPs across the world and continue to tout this as a strength, but **the problem with smaller POPs is that the amount of content that can be stored is limited**
      * This means that if a data request is sent to a small POP that’s full, the request will have to travel all the way to an origin server, which could increase the time by a factor of 10x or more
   * Legacy CDNs (like Akamai) built their architectures based on the old Internet backbone aka dial-up which required these smaller POPs that are now nearly impossible to upgrade
   * Fastly examined all this and took a different approach
      * If legacy POPs are local convenience stores in which you have to visit multiple to buy all your groceries, Fastly’s POPs are Costco-style supermarkets where you can buy everything at once
      * Fastly’s POPs have much more storage space which significant reduces the need for requests to go back to origin servers
      * In addition to that, Fastly utilized SSDs to store cached data which is more expensive but offer much faster retrieval times (in a [blog post](https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-having-more-pops-isnt-always-better), Fastly compares this to “having all of your items waiting for you at the supermarket checkout stand instead of having to walk around the supermarket with a huge cart hunting for each item on your list”). The SSDs Fastly uses are orders of magnitudes faster than standard hard drives
      * The punchline is just that Fastly created a super modern internet architecture through powerful POPs that result in much faster average content delivery times for their customers
   * **3) Developer customization**
      * Fastly’s founder Artur was frustrated by the lack of control from the CDNs he worked with and as a result, Fastly since its early days has been focused on serving developers and engineers
      * While legacy providers required technical support to roll out changes, Fastly added programmability to content control through Varnish, an open-source web accelerator
      * [Varnish](https://www.fastly.com/blog/benefits-using-varnish) allows for powerful features, such as instant purge of content, reverse proxies, and real-time data monitoring and management
      * Perhaps most importantly, Varnish allows developers to adjust caching policies based on their unique needs, giving developers much more flexibility and control and resulting in happier customers
* So to sum up, from the very start, Fastly took a **different approach to its content delivery and customized nearly every step of the process** which is ultimately what helped the company disrupt the legacy CDN industry

**Fastly’s Products**

* I won’t cover too much of Fastly’s CDN products because I’ve basically mentioned what Fastly does there (deliver content to users real fast)
   * One thing to note, however, is that even with Fastly’s unique positioning, **the overall sentiment is that CDN is a commoditized industry** and so there will be significant competition on pricing moving forward
* That’s why Fastly’s future areas of growth is not in CDN but in its **Edge Compute Technology and Cloud Security**
* **Compute@Edge**
   * Starting with Edge Compute Technology, in November 2019, Fastly announced the launch of the beta testing for Compute@Edge
   * **Compute@Edge is a platform that allows developers to build applications at the edge rather than in centralized data centers,** and this provides the benefits of better security, performance, and scalability in a severless compute environment. This goes MUCH MORE beyond a traditional CDN.
   * Traditionally, cloud-based applications **centralize logic in a data center (imagine a really big office space full of servers)** that eventually hops over to a user’s device regardless of where that user is geographically located
      * The problem with this is that computation costs money and it becomes more expensive the further out from the origin that you get
   * Lucet
      * In response to the 4 aforementioned requirements, just like in its early days when it was developing its CDN, Fastly took on a customized approach by building Lucet
   * In the latest Q4 2020 earnings call, management highlighted that Compute@Edge has seen considerable progress, naming multiple use cases in the gaming, machine learning, language, and ad-tech industries
   * With all this said, while Fastly is a pioneer in the edge compute space and Compute@Edge could be a source for a lot of growth, it’s also likely that other competitors will quickly copy the company's approach and there are no guarantees in the eventual size of the market
   * As a result, this product is something **investors need to keep a close eye on in 2021** to see how the product develops and how competitors react
* **Secure@Edge**
   * The second product to highlight is Fastly’s Cloud Security services, which is known as Secure@Edge
   * While Fastly's previous security offerings were comparable to its competitors, Fastly notably bolstered its competitive position with its acquisition of **Signal Sciences** in August 2020
   * To give a bit of background, Signal Sciences was founded by 3 former Etsy employees who were frustrated by the limits of existing security solutions to protect web apps
      * Just like Fastly, these founders designed a new Web Application Firewall or WAF that was both **modern and developer friendly (similar to Fastly’s story)**
      * From these beginning, the team built a WAF with 3 key advantages including **higher accuracy, increased automation, and flexibility**
   * And since then, Signal Sciences became one of the world’s hottest startups and was selected by Forbes in May 2020 as one of the top 25 fastest growing startups likely to reach a $1BN valuation
      * In February 2020, Gartner compiled reviews from customers of WAF products and Signal Sciences was the most highly rated amongst all competition with a 4.9 out of 5 rating
   * Through the combined company, Fastly is offering what’s known as Secure@Edge and is arguably a leader in the web app security space
   * **Secure@Edge will be built on top of the Compute@Edge platform,** which means cloud applications won’t require a separate security layer in front of them which is a gamechanger and results in lower costs and higher effectiveness
   * Perhaps most importantly, what this does is help accelerate **edge computing adoption,** which again is the big bet Fastly is making on its future growth
   * The last thing I want to highlight are just a few of the metrics of the deal
      * Signal Sciences was acquired for $775 million of which $575 million was Fastly stock, which is good because that means the Signal Science’s team are Fastly shareholders and incentivized to help the company succeed
      * Signal Sciences also about 42 additional enterprise customers to Fastly which the company can now more easily cross-sell other products to
      * The company generated annual recurring revenue of $28 million as of June 2020 and was growing at 62% vs. Fastly which typically grows in the 30s and 40s
      * Gross margins are above 85%, which is much higher than Fastly’s which is usually in the 50s
      * And lastly, gross retention of 96% shows that the stickiness of Signal Science’s product which is a great sign
* **To recap, hopefully by now you see that Fastly is much more than a CDN company. Through Compute@Edge and Secure@Edge, Fastly is building the next generation’s edge computing platform**

**Competitive Positioning**

* Fastly [markets itself well](https://www.fastly.com/why-fastly) as a company with a developer-first mentality, which is a very modern marketing approach versus in the past where legacy CDN companies used to target C-suite executives
   * The 3 key strengths Fastly touts are lower costs, more control, and better security - all 3 of which are things we covered
* The key competitor names in edge computing that you should know are Amazon’s Lambda@Edge, Microsoft’s Intelligent Edge, Akamai’s Intelligent Edge Platform, and Cloudflare’s Workers platform
   * I’m not going to go into Fastly’s competitors too much because I’ll be making another post later about Cloudflare which is Fastly’s main competition
* When looking at all these competitors, Fastly boasts the fastest cold start time at 35 microseconds, which far beats out any of the legacy competitors and its biggest competitor Cloudflare
* The last important thing I want to mention in regards to Fastly’s competitive positioning is its management team
   * Fastly has assembled a world-class team both organically and through acquisitions and this is one of those intangible strengths that’s hard to measure but very important for a company that’s trying to disrupt an industry
   * This [blog](https://softwarestackinvesting.com/fastly-and-signal-sciences/) has a really great description of the company’s management team (search the term “brain trust” and you can read a bunch of management bios there

**Customers**

* Fastly focuses on large enterprise customers, which the company defines as a customer that spends **more than $100K annually**
   * This is a primary distinguishing factor from Cloudflare, which is another leading CDN company that focuses on small businesses
* According to their Q4 2020 earnings report, Fastly has a total number of customers of 2084, of which 324 are enterprise customers
* Fastly serves some of the most highly innovative digital companies in the world who which really validates the company’s services (Microsoft, Slack, Shopify, etc.)

**Financial Overview**

* Highlights from Q4 2020 results:
   * **2019-2020 full-year revenue growth of 45%** (a bit inflated due to Signal Sciences acquisition, but nevertheless, very solid)
   * **Non-GAAP gross margin of 60.9%** (up from 56.6% and this should trend upwards due to Signal Science’s high gross margin
* The key revenue-related metrics (besides growth rate) you need to keep track of each quarter (which are also provided in the quarterly earnings report) are the following: 
   * **DBNER** \- 143% this past quarter which is really high, and means that if a customer was spending $100 last year, they spend $143 today (but declined slightly from 147% from Q3 2020)
   * **Net retention rate** \- 115% which is also high but declined from 122% from Q3 2020
      * DBNER excludes customer churn while the net retention rate does take into account customer churn (i.e. customers lost)
   * **Annual revenue retention rate -** 99%, meaning Fastly lost just 1% of customers (obviously very good)
* In its latest quarter, Fastly’s DBNER and NRRs showed to be on a slight decline due to the company’s own incredibly high standards, but still this is a bit worrisome to investors
* Valuation
   * At its share price around $73-$74, Fastly is currently trading at a \~23X 2022 sales multiple, which at a \~40% growth rate is very attractive given the current environment
   * Company has been hit hard recently because of potential loss of TikTok as a customer (this is something still looming over the company’s head and in the latest call, management didn’t really confirm or deny anything) and relatively soft guidance of $375mm-$385mm for 2021, which represents a 30% growth rate ($291mm for 2020 revenue)
      * In my view, I think management is doing a good job being conservative and in the long-run, investors will be pleasantly surprised with Fastly’s growth as long as the company can execute on its Compute@Edge and Secure@Edge products

**Resources Used**

* [Software Stack Investing](https://softwarestackinvesting.com/tag/fsly/) **-** This blog is a godsend. SO much great information for a lot of top tech companies. Pretty dense to read through but this was a source for a lot of my DD post

* [Earnings transcript](https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Fastly-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript.pdf)

**TLDR:** Fastly is a leader in the CDN and edge computing space with 2 innovative products (Compute@Edge and Secure@Edge) that could be strong growth drivers for years to come (given strong execution). The company is boasting strong growth and has been a victim of its own success but is trading at relatively reasonably multiples for a leading software company. ",stocks,Fastly (FSLY) Full Due Diligence Post - Promising Company at Relatively Fair Valuation,126.0,0.93
EarbudScreen,0.0,123.0,"Disclaimer: Turn away if you believe that BABA is going to be broken up because Ma hurt some feelings over Ant.

I personally discredit claims that BABA is in significant danger due to Ma's comments. Ant was dramatically overleveraged, and regulators  stepped in to prevent a collapse. [https://www.techbuzzchina.com/newsletter/signup/extra-buzz-19-ant-group-the-biggest-ipo-that-wasnt?fbclid=IwAR3T9V0ThoGj3W-vS3e-TCZJ1wpyKXJkmBZoUXLYeMBIpBcaMy1COgw2Qbs](https://www.techbuzzchina.com/newsletter/signup/extra-buzz-19-ant-group-the-biggest-ipo-that-wasnt?fbclid=IwAR3T9V0ThoGj3W-vS3e-TCZJ1wpyKXJkmBZoUXLYeMBIpBcaMy1COgw2Qbs)

Now to BABA, they trade at 27 times earnings. Coca Cola, the trusty dividend company, trades at 28 times earnings. Forward PE is even more egregious. BABA has sturdy competition in its retail business from Pinduoduo and JD, but BABA operates a platform with ancillary tools to keep merchants there, giving staying power. BABA is the leader in the transition to cloud (47% in 2019 according to Canalys). BABA is the inversed Amazon in terms of profitability. BABA makes money from their retail platform, doesn't get into the weeds, and is currently sacrificing profitability for market share in cloud.

Furthermore, BABA has stakes in a wide range of logistics and consumer service companies. Even after appropriately discounting ADR and BABA being a Chinese company, to me it's criminally undervalued trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO while having clear future growth. Would love to hear how BABA deserves this low multiple.

TLDR: BABA has growth in cloud, even after writing off their retail growth, with stakes in many companies, acting as a counterweight to the giant Tencent, all while trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO.

Position: 3 shares at $246 (sad college kid noises)

Edit: KO is a comparison to show low the market is pricing BABA's future growth.

2nd Edit: ""Criminally Undervalued"" was my Substack writing bleeding over into real life. Apologies for that sensational diction. Much thanks to all who commented substantive counterpoints and rationales about the nature of ADRs, market sentiment, and fair value. However, comments that just say ""CCP"" or ""because it's Chinese=fraud"" A) doesn't change anyone's sentiment, B) is overly reductional and C) doesn't add anything to the core discussion of the company. First time in a while making a post like this, and I appreciate the feedback with points like mentioning dividends!

Warren Buffett’s conglomerate could reveal that equity holding when it discloses its stock investments as of Dec. 31, 2020 on a securities filing expected late Tuesday.

Speculation is that it could be Walt Disney ￼ (ticker: DIS), PayPal Holdings ￼ (PYPL), Google parent Alphabet ￼ (GOOGL), Home Depot ￼ (HD), Exxon Mobil ￼ (XOM), or Chevron ￼ (CVX).

When it released its most recent quarterly filing in mid-November for about $250 billion of equity holdings, Berkshire (BRK.B) said that it had made a confidential filing for unnamed investments, stating “Confidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.”

Berkshire CEO Buffett has rarely made use of a confidential filing in the past decade. The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 ￼ (PSX).

The SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.

The mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.

Gary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.

Black has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company’s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.

In recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire’s holding in Goldman Sachs Group ￼ (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase ￼ (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo ￼ (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie ￼ (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb ￼ (BMY).

I think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd.

Disney will be also favorable since it is the best recovery play stock with huge grow opportunity with streaming. What do you guys think.

HaveADrinkOnMeCosby,0.0,113.0,"The most undervalued stock on Wall Street AND a high short %

Huya operates a freemium platform. It sells ads across its platform, but it generates most of its revenue from virtual gifts viewers can buy for their favorite broadcasters. Last quarter, Huya generated 94% of its revenue from its live streaming business, and the remaining 6% from online ads. Remember this last part. 

Huya's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 18% year-over-year to 172.9 million last quarter. Within that total, its mobile MAUs grew 16% to 74.2 million, and its total number of paid users increased 13% to 5.3 million.

CEO Rongjie Dong attributed that growth to an increase in e-sports tournaments throughout the shorter summer and its deeper ties with Tencent, the world's largest video game publisher. If Huya closes its planned merger with Douyu next year, its MAUs could more than double to nearly 370 million, with over 13 million paid users.  

PINTEREST has less monthly active users and is worth 50 BILLION!!!!

Huya generates higher profits because it shares a near-duopoly with Douyu, is backed by Tencent's massive video game business, and generates most of its revenue from higher-margin virtual gifts instead of lower-margin digital ads.

Wall Street expects Huya's revenue and earnings to rise 40% and 74%, respectively, this year. Next year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 36%, respectively. Based on those estimates, Huya looks incredibly cheap at 19 times forward earnings and just two times next year's sales.

Those forecasts don't account for Huya's potential merger with Douyu, which could easily double its annual revenue. But its valuation should remain roughly the same after the all-stock merger, since it will grant current shareholders of Huya and Douyu equal halves of the new company.

Tencent holdings is about to merge DOYU and HUYA into the biggest online gaming streaming service in China (roughly 80%). 

I predict tencent (the “kingmaker”) will turn it into an advertisement giant, they will have roughly 370 million active users (think Pinterest at 50B mcap) at a market cap of 10B (post merger). 

This is a HIGHLY shorted stock at 35% of float. It is being manipulated, I believe, because the shorts are having a problem covering with the recent run up (they just filed the merger with the SEC) so an “analyst” gave it a downgrade to help them out today. 

This is a buying opportunity of a lifetime. Huya/DOYU will be a dominate player in the biggest growing sector there is right now (Chinese gaming)... and UNLIKE GameStop, it is a highly profitable business and IS severely undervalued at it’s current price.

   1. January 29th, 2021 ($EH - $66.36) - EHang receives $40M investment from Carmignac. Carmignac is a French [asset management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management) firm founded in 1989. What is important to note is that they one of the largest funds in all of Europe with $35 billion under management. And furthermore their flagship fund the Carmignac Patrimoine was one of the few funds during the volatility of 2008-2011 that outperformed their peers. I would imagine being one of the premier benchmarked asset management firms in Europe that their DD would have been successfully completed.

The close and professional cooperation between the specialist teams of Austro Control and FACC led to this milestone.

Of the portions of the research that are suspicious, or have clearly a bias, or have questionable content as they cannot be confirmed or verified in the report and should be ignored in the report.

1. Suspicious Timing  

   1. As the Chinese New Year is in full swing, it is a week long federal holiday. This ensure that panic sellers will not be able to reach with out any additional information.
   2. Slow releases starting around 1200EST-1400EST or roughly 2300-0300 in China, which also ensures that any response will be delayed until after panic selling has been complete.
   3. This in fact caused the stock price to drop almost 62% which brings to price back to roughly \~1 month ago before its run up.
2. Lack of Personnel in EHang Locations, Video Released by Wolfpack Research:  

   1. No metadata on Youtube video, unable to verify date and time stamp. Claimed to be shot during January *but no exact dates are provided.*
   2. Video taken over the federal holiday, there of course would be no people in the building.
   3. But what we are able to see is that there are actual EH216 vehicles that are being built and/or assembled, with lots of parts in boxes. If there were actual fraud, there would be absolutely no reason to even spent the effort in having all those parts and pieces. In fact there would be ample security to ensure that no one would ever discover the deception.
3. eVTOL expert Dr. Moore from Uber and NASA  

   1. Regarding his opinion of the use of hobby motors and general quality. Working at NASA we have seen how stagnant NASA has become due to their over redundancy and unwillingness to take risk compared to how SpaceX operates. But redundancy is waste, especially in startups that do not have the federal money. If ""hobby"" motors work, then why over-engineer something? I think we can draw parallels to early Tesla motors but the key thing is that they worked and that is all that matters.
   2. Lack of research budget, when you work for NASA anything that is not in the billions would of course be considered anemic, but the company is working first to pioneer passenger VTOLs and then moving on getting acceptance for autonomous technology.
4. Flight Autonomy Dream (Headline: It is not, its already here and it works)  

   1. Flight autonomy is already well used in the the aviation industry. In fact the majority of your domestic and international flights utilize autopilot where the pilot has pre-entered in a specific heading and altitude.
   2. DJI with their Mavic Air series are able to perform limited autonomous flight in a consumer drone for under $1000 including takeoff, object detection and avoidance, GPS flight routine, landing, and return to base landing. If a consumer drone maker can do this it is not a leap of imagination to think that the same principles can be applied here.
   3. ***There is nothing special regarding autonomous flight.***
   4. In fact you can see from this Wikipedia image regarding autonomous control levels shows that as early as in 2000s with the Predator and Global Hawk autonomous flight was already widely used in the defense sector. Today the focus into the future are fully autonomous swarms, far far ahead of what is necessary for autonomous drone flight.

Autonomous Control Level Trend

1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Office Visit - Distributor of EHang  

   1. Interview with employee who ""claimed"" to be the finance manager pushing to sell their own drones, which does not make sense because Kunxiang does not make any drones and is a distributor. Also the finance manager reportedly said that their drone had *4 hours flight time* which is an absolutely unbelievable claim versus EHang's 30 minutes of total flight time which is far more realistic. No additional evidence was provided by WolfPack regarding the ""claimed"" finance manager, name, title or any of substance.

Of the portions that provide a negative attack and are at best circumstantial evidence

1. \# of NewsWire PR Articles - Apparently having 55 news article in 14 months constitutes a pump and dump scheme.
2. Lack of Infrastructure Progress and Investments - Because not all progress has gone according to plan, I wonder what other large companies have had the same issues that have become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
3. Misleading English/Chinese Press Release  

   1. While the titles maybe misleading, Googling the original Chinese press releases identifies does not actually mislead any of the readers. It does not make any false claims regarding passenger vehicles or their permitting, in fact it is actually Dr. Mark Moore who is making the *assumptions based upon the title*. And you know what they say about assumptions, they make an a\*\* out of you and me. I would think that a NASA engineer would take his time reading the article, I mean they certainly are taking their time with SLS.

Of the portions that have merit:

1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Price Disparity  

   1. Of all the points in the short research, this maybe one of merit.
   2. The buyer purchased EH216 at widely varying prices from 1.5 million RMB per unit to 150 million RMB as stated in two difference SEC Sales Contract reports. This wide disparity is a note for cause.
2. Rapidly Growing Accounts with low account receivable and allegation of fabricated sales  

   1. Is this not similar to how TSLA presold cars? Additional research needs to be done into this.
   2. Again the research does not say it is evidence of fabricated sales but only that is a textbook indication. ***Again circumstantial evidence is not real evidence.***
   3. ***Why is this buried at the tail end of the report? At page 19 out of 33.*** If this was truly damning than it should have been at the forefront.
3. Ongoing Lawsuit  

   1. Could be a future issue, however without knowing the full evidence of the trial it is difficult to make judgement.

WolfPack Research History so far (two words, desperate &amp; terrible)

[https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports](https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports)

Of the 6 short researches, all of them insisted that the various companies committed fraud and yet ***5 out of the 6 stocks*** are up since their report. I will not mention the tickers as they have all been banned by the mods. With a singular exception, they say a broken clock is wrong twice a day. If ever there was a clear evidence of false reporting and market manipulation this is it. In my opinion WolfPack research utilizes its financial disclaimer purporting that this research is only an expression of their opinion to side step any legal ramifications.

I have to state that $EH has been on a tear lately and as a very young startup it has been on a tremendous run up. It more than likely would have drop due to a pull back but I believe that air transportation will be the next TSLA, especially in China where the population density is 153 per KM2. Electric air transportation is the only way to alleviate the congestion that is plagues their streets and their cities.

But I like this stock!

GoldnDiesel,0.0,109.0,"Full Disclosure - I'm holding about 100 shares @ 38. 

There was plenty of DD about CRSR leading up to earnings, everything I looked at showed amazing future potential for this company that is consistently showing it is making alot of money and doing the right things to keep the company growing. 

After the drop in price after earnings, the research I did showed that this is normal for a stock that had alot of movement before an ER. 

That said, what usually happens after it finds its support, or resistance level, it will start to climb back up. I think we are currently at this point of consolidation before a upturn. It has held around $42 for a few days now, and with money coming out of Weed stocks and possibly out of pump and dump selections, it only seems logical that money will start being put back into safer, profitable, future potential companies. 

This is why I like CRSR, I have seen reports saying it's new price point is $50+. I agree with that price, and think that is a very safe evaluation with the possibility of reaching $60 by end of year. 

This isn't a DD, if you want to read up on it, check around all the subs, plenty of great long detailed posts discussing their potential. I am just reminding people to not forget about it if you are looking for a safer investment after making money (or losing) on the recent pump and dumps. 


;TLDR - CRSR has plenty of future potential, looks like it's hit it's support level and should start to trend back upwards. Take a look for yourself at the many great DDs posted before earnings, and then at how well they did last few quarters. Very large upside potential here for the long term as a safer investment.

akokaz1,0.0,108.0,"I created an algorithm that scans popular trading subreddits and logs when stocks are mentioned. It also analyses the posts and comments that the stocks are mentioned in and calculates the sentiment and context the stock is mentioned in.

The algorithm tries to track the overall hype and prevalence of the stock across the different subreddits, rather than simply calculating the amount of times the stock is mentioned.

**How do I currently use this?**  
Normally, I would browse different subreddits to try and learn about new stocks that are trending or being discussed. I would use those stocks as the basis of my due-diligence research over the next few days.

What I found was that this was not only time-consuming, but by the time I had done my research, the stock had already shot up in price based on the news or events that were being discussed on Reddit, or simply from the fact that now everyone is aware of this upcoming stock.

The algorithm serves as an early detection system, allowing me to pick up stocks such as SRNE or PLTR before their big price shifts.

**What is it not?**

This is an early detection tool, you should not base your investment decisions solely on the results of this algorithm.

**Please do your own DD before investing.**

**Results**

The results represent the most discussed stocks across the various sub-reddits over the last week, their price movement over the last 2-weeks *(first value in percentages)* and their overall bullishness sentiment score (second value, in bold, ranging from 0 (*negative*) to 100(*positive*)).

[https://ibb.co/vk0hLL0](https://ibb.co/vk0hLL0)

of the top 3 discussed stocks in there, **Aphria Inc (APHA)** **+45%** is the most interesting for me.

This was actually a stock my algorithm has identified for a number of days now, peaking a few days later, however given the continued chatter, and the long-term outlook for this stock, I think there is still a big upside for this stock.

Aphria Inc is a Canada-based international recreation and medicinal based cannabis distribution company. The Company’s Canadian cannabis operations are comprised of its Aphria One greenhouse facility (Aphria One), facilities held through its wholly owned British Columbia-based subsidiary, Broken Coast Cannabis Ltd. (Broken Coast) and its Leamington-based subsidiary, 1974568 Ontario Limited (Aphria Diamond).

APHA also manufacture and distribute bottled, canned and draft craft beers. The Company currently has established operations in Canada, Germany, Italy, Malta, Colombia and Argentina.

With a market cap of $5.9bn, it’s currently one of the largest cannabis companies globally, and will only grow even further once its merger with **Tilray (TLRY)** *(this is another stock my algorithm picked up on)* is complete.

To keep things brief, I will skip over discussing the merger in this post, focussing on the company financials and growth landscape instead *(I can cover this in detail if this is something people are after)*.

**Revenue**

APHA has had consistent revenue growth, going from $237m in 2019 to $543m in FY 2020, an increase of **125%**. By comparison, its closest rival Canopy Growth Corporation had a revenue increase of **%76**.

While revenue growth this year will be slightly subdued this year due to COVID supply issues and temporary closure of retail shops, pent-up demand (fuelled not only by a desire to make up for lost time, but also as a way for people to cope with the built-up anxiety of lockdown) and further mainstreaming of recreational cannabis products will only support growth long-term.

In November, Aphria purchased Sweetwater Brewing, one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US. This, along with the fact that TLRY has a contract with InBev, one of the largest beverage producers in the world, and the growing demand for more flexible ways to consume cannabis, opens up a completely new revenue stream. It’s price since that merger is up **311%**.

**Politics**

In the US, Democrats now control all of Congress, Senate and the White House. Their more progressive stance on recreational drugs compared to the previous administration means decriminalisation at a federal level is a lot more likely. This is highlighted by Chuck Schumer’s announcement that a draft of the bill be introduced at some point H1 2021.

Full US decriminalisation not only unlocks a massive market, but also places focus on European countries to follow suit with full de-restriction and regulation (this is already happening in some countries, with France currently undergoing a public consultation).

When this happens, Aphria’s European operations and scale means they can go to market at scale quicker than most rivals.

**Possible downsides**

Cannabis stocks are volatile stocks at the best of times, given the hype that has emerged on WallStreetBets surrounding this sector in the last few days, expect price to be volatile, with some more potential downside as the hype cools down.

Furthermore, some analysts are skeptical of the true size of the recreational cannabis market, suggesting growth has plateaued, pointing to sub-par market performance compared to projections historically. Personally, I believe this is all short term, as the market becomes more embedded and accepted, we will see more ‘casual’ users entering the market.

**Summary**

Underneath all the volatility, APHA has some solid fundamentals that stand out compared to peers in the sector, that’s without taking into account the TLRY merger, which personally I believe will be a game changer.

In terms of investment play, this is a long-term hold, so if you are interested prepare to purchase and hold for 2–3 years. There is lots of volatility surrounding the stock, especially currently, I would suggest a small portfolio allocation, entering either before the merger, or before US decriminalisation if you miss that boat.

NameInsertedHere,0.0,101.0,"I'll start by providing a chronological history of the company, then I'll explain the three pillars of Score Media and Gaming which drive the company today and some further context.

Their History:

* 1993 - They launched SportScope, a Canadian TV channel with a sports ticker/scroll banner at the bottom.
* 1997 - SportScope morphs into Headline Sports.
* 2000 - Headline Sports morphs into ""the Score Television Network"".
* 2007 - theScore is the first multisport news and data app launched on Apple App Store.
* 2011 - theScore established itself as market leader in the mobile sports coverage space with 1 million active users.
* 2012 - theScore Inc is created after theScore sells its TV company ""theScore Television Network"" to  Rogers Communications.
* 2015 - theScore creates its eSports platform on YouTube.
* 2019 - They partner with Bet.Works to create betting backend technology. They launch sports betting in New Jersey in partnership with Monmouth Racetrack, becoming the first and only US media company to create and operate a mobile sportsbook. They also enter into a strategic multi-State market access partnership with Penn National Gaming
* 2020 - They launch sports betting in Colorado and Indiana and up list from TSXV to TSX.
* 2021 - They've launched in Iowa and have announced their IPO for the NASDAQ. They stated that there will be more state expansions to come this year for theScore Bet.

**The three pillars**

*theScore*

* theScore app is one of the most popular mobile sports apps in North America, ranking 3rd in North America and in Canada among multi-sport news and data applications. In Canada, theScore app had approximately double the users of its closest competitors, TSN and Sportsnet, and approximately ten times the users of ESPN’s app.
* theScore app generated approximately 3.7 billion user sessions over the last year, with average monthly sessions per active user growing at approximately 9% from 2016 to present.
* Users of theScore app engaged with the application for approximately 101 minutes per month on average, ranking first among their peers
* Their user chat features are very popular, particularly among users focused on sports betting, with approximately 48% of users who chat sending betting-related messages, and approximately 40% of their overall monthly active users consuming public chat content.
* They recently announced their all time record in revenue generated from ads in their app.

*theScore esports*

* theScore esports produces and shares original videocontent pieces across its web and social platforms, including features and documentaries on high-profile teams, games and players from across the world of esports, as well as highlights and interviews. theScore esports’ video content is distributed across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.
* They have approximately 1.6 million subscribers to their YouTube channel.
* 1.1 million followers on TikTok as of Dec 2020
* Their esports video content generated approximately 357 million views across all channels during the three-month period which ended November 30, 2020. Representing a 358% year-over-year growth in total views of their esports video content from the same period last year.
* Worldwide, it's estimated that 495 million people watched esports online or on television in 2020, and that viewership could grow up to 646 million people annually by 2023. As a result of growth of interest in younger generations of sports fans, it is estimated that esports will become one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long-term.

*theScore Bet*

* theScore Bet is authorized to provide sports betting services in New Jersey, Colorado, Indiana, and in Iowa. They also have market access for up to nine additional states via their multi-state market access agreements with Penn National Gaming
* theScore Bet has market access to operate an online casino in New Jersey via a multi-year agreement with Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. and anticipates launching its product in the state in the second half of calendar 2021. This is important because
* Approximately 50% of users of theScore Bet on iOS devices are also users of theScore app, engaging with their content and their integrated media and betting ecosystem. This means that because they already have the userbase through their media that they don't have to spend as much on marketing compared to their competitors.
* The total online gross gaming revenue generated in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $18 billion, of which approximately $6.4 billion is estimated to be generated in the states covered by their market access agreements.

**Further Context:**

Canada is on the brink of legalizing single event sports betting through bill C-218. It passed the 2nd reading by a vote of 303 and 15. It's estimated that wagering will begin by September (Start of the NFL). This is important for thescore because of their strong Canadian user base.

On February 11 2021 theScore completed a 10-1 share consolidation for the purpose of up-listing to the NASDAQ. They announced their IPO this week ~~and several sources indicate that their pricing will take place tomorrow. Usually the stock starts trading 1 day after the pricing, therefore it will start trading on the NASDAQ on Friday. I expect to receive an official statement from theScore tomorrow.~~ The stock will trade under SCR on the TSX and the NAS.

The two key factors to their success as a betting company will rely strongly on the integrations between their media and betting platforms which no other company can compete with and their massive user base from their sports media app converting to bettors. As I stated above, almost 50% of the users who chat via their media app also bet.

SCR'S market cap currently sits at 1.64B, in comparison DKNG sits at 23.61B and PENN sits at 18.69.

This shows the kind of opportunity that theScore has and the unique position that it is placed in.

EDIT: theScore [announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thescore-announces-pricing-upsized-initial-010000199.html) that they will be trading on the NASDAQ as of FEBRUARY 25.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Just-Principle,0.0,100.0,"Hi All,

I very rarely post my trading ideas on reddit but I have seen this company gaining traction in a number of investment related sub-reddits and I've been researching it quite heavily over the past couple of weeks. With the earnings call out of the way and a good entry point at hand,  I'd like to discuss my outline of the business and my short-term price targets. After that, I will discuss how I am approaching this trade, namely through cheaply priced long-term call options 

**Core Outline of the Business Model:**

I presume most people are familiar with CVS in some capacity but you may not be aware of the whole of their current business model. As you might imagine, a large part of CVS is its pharmacy sector. CVS sells and manages prescription and OTC drugs, receiving most of its revenues as reimbursement from insurance. CVS also provides a number of pharmacy services (vaccinations, minor check ups, etc.) This has been a growing part of their business as I'll discuss later. You also probably know that CVS has a large retail sector. They sell candy, household goods, etc. Not very exciting. 

However, if you have not been following this company, you are probably unaware that since 2018 CVS has also owned Aetna, an insurance provider, and Caremark, a PBM (pharmacy benefit manager). Aetna obviously collects premium and partially or fully covers the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs for its clients. Caremark, as PBM, negotiates with drug manufacturers on behalf of clients and takes a cut of the money that it saves consumers. 

I'll discuss the potential developments in each these sectors but first I'd like to state my central thesis:

**Price Target, Fair Value Estimate, and Spreadsheets Galore**

**The Central Thesis:** CVS is deeply undervalued at $70-75 dollars a share (EV/EBITDA \~9) given its consistent, if moderate, revenue and earnings growth. This cheap pricing  likely reflects market fears over 1. CVS' debt and 2. Competition with Amazon. I believe that these fears are unsubstantiated and should be dispelled as CVS begins to pay off its debt with its strong cash flow and fully integrates its newly acquired insurance sector and its growing service business. The market should accordingly award CVS a higher earnings multiple and this in-addition to growing earnings should provide investors with an above market return. This investment also provides a good opportunity for considerable leverage considering the cheap pricing of long term options contracts. 

***2 Year Price Target: $100***

***Long Term Fair Value: $130-140*** 

I will try to keep the rest of this post mostly to text. However, since I am providing a concrete price target and fair value estimate, I should provide concrete numbers to back them. 

The  full forecasting I used for my 2 year price target can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnS5nVvVcAfRu4TrPwXL7IFEMXP9OLTJI5HRe5EuBV8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnS5nVvVcAfRu4TrPwXL7IFEMXP9OLTJI5HRe5EuBV8/edit?usp=sharing)

The fair value estimate comes from u/EnduredMarkets: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPR0TqRXZOYqM81nUfuUGIRsot9kfDIif93L7H3y1YQ/edit#gid=1734015007](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPR0TqRXZOYqM81nUfuUGIRsot9kfDIif93L7H3y1YQ/edit#gid=1734015007)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is CVS so cheap?** 

You'll notice looking at the CVS chart that CVS has traded in the $70 range for a long time putting it at a very cheap (9-10x EV/EBITDA) despite its strong earnings and revenue growth. In fact it was down almost 5% today on a earnings report with almost no surprises. What is the market concerned about? 

1. Debt: CVS acquired ALOT of debt in 2018 when it acquired Aetna. As a result of this, CVS has had a rather concerning Debt/EBITDA above 5 for the past 2 years. However, I believe these concerns are overblown. Debt is obviously a detriment to a business because its represents future earnings that will not be paid to share holders. However, debt is only really a concern when it puts a company at risk of default. This is not a concern with CVS. CVS's free cash flow from operations has allowed them to consistently service their capex, debt, and share holder obligations with almost a third of this cashflow left over. CVS, in fact, could have been more aggressive about paying down this debt for the past couple years but chose not to. This is likely because the cost of servicing these debts was so low (interest rates) and because they saw opportunities to expand their buisness. CVS (both in their own earnings reports and by analyst estimates) is expected to pay down this debt over the next two years and should reach a much healthier 3x debt/EBITDA by the end of 2022
2. Amazon: Amazon has recently introduced Amazon Pharmacy, a mail service for prescription drugs. Obviously as soon as Amazon gets into your industry you should just close up shop right? Not necessarily. Amazon has not been particularly aggressive in expanding their pharmacy business. As far as I can tell, they have not pursued aggressive pricing schemes like in other industries they've attempted to disrupt. In my view, Amazon Pharmacy is intended to act as an added incentive from Prime members rather than an industry disruptor. However, even if they should become aggressive, CVS has two key advantages.  First, CVS has great synergistic benefits from their insurance and PBM buisnesses which they can use to keep customers in the CVS ecosystem and offer attractive pricing. Second, healthcare is an area where consumers are likely to stick to known trusted brand names. Amazon is well positioned to disrupt ""low stakes"" businesses (groceries, consumer goods, etc.) where you can ""just give it a try."" You may not be as likely to switch to them from known healthcare provider which has records of your regular prescriptions/healthcare info and may be entrusted to deliver critical, lifesaving medication. I believe that this will become apparent to markets over the next couple of years as CVS continues to grow revenue and earnings in a post-covid world. 

If we, as investors, do not believe that these factors are of concern, then we can assume that CVS's earnings will continue to grow as they have over the past couple years (mid single digit per year) and that the market will award CVS a higher earnings multiple as it does so**. My 2 year price target of $100/share assumes that this scenario plays out (i.e. CVS maintains it status quo).**

**Added Business Drivers**

As I just stated, I attempted to have a conservative outlook in my price projection. However, there are two key additional developments in CVS' business which may propel earnings and price further than expected in this estimate. 

1. Aetna-Caremark-CVS synergy: For a traditional pharmacy, there are a lot of negotiators to work with. Customer, PBM, Drug manufacturer, insurance provide, and pharmacy all have to agree to certain terms which fit their best interest. With Aetna and Caremark under its wings, CVS controls all parts of this system except of the customer and drug manufacturer. This provides a number of synergistic benefits that can be used to drive revenues and improve margins. For example:

a. Aetna may offer consumers lower co-pays to get their prescriptions at CVS pharmacies

b. Aetna and CVS pharmacy can merge their collected customer data to recommend preventative treatment which will lower customer and insurance expenses by avoiding costly procedures as a result of a health crisis

c. Caremark may use the added leverage of its association with CVS pharmacy and its gains in customer base (due to the advantage its able to provide due to these other synergistic effects) to negotiate better drug pricing from manufacturers (thereby increasing their profits and reducing customer costs.)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Health Hubs: CVS has, for a while now, had ""minute clinics""  in CVS stores where customers can receive shots and basic health assessments. However, CVS has recently introduced ""health hubs"" which offer a much wider range of services. In essence, these health hubs can provide almost all of the healthcare services provided by a primary care doctor at a much lower cost. These health hubs have not been fully rolled out yet and are only being tested in a few cities. However, they are expected to become increasingly prevalent if they are successful. Not only do these health hubs provide an additional source of revenue to CVS, they can be a good way of introducing customers to CVS' system. Using a ""health hub"" provides CVS with the opportunity to recommend that a customer switch to Aetna as an insurance provider by offering them low or zero co-pay at the health hub. Aetna can then incentivize them to use CVS as a pharmacy. Caremark gains the negotiating power of another customer. A fully integrated, healthcare ecosystem.

I'm not an expert in this industry. I have no idea if these additional factors will play out. However, if they do, they will likely bolster earnings and CVS' share price

&amp;#x200B;

**Cheap Options Pricing**

If you're only interested in holding shares, you can stop reading here. This is a great play as a shareholder looking for above market returns and you can earn a good dividend along the way. 

I, however, am adding leverage to this play with long dated, ITM, call options (LEAPS). Because of CVS's low volatility, options pricing is incredibly cheap. Buying, ITM options for Jan 2023 will allow you to at least breakeven, even if CVS only returns 8% over the next 2 years. If CVS hits my price target, this play will provide \~100% return. If the extreme bull-case plays out, \~200-300% return. Obviously, the use of options introduces considerable risk. If you're wrong and hold to expiration, you will lose all your investment. However, I believe that CVS is priced so cheaply it is unlikely to trade much lower and I see good potential for it to reach my current price target. If you access the ""what contract should I buy"" and ""ROI Calculator"" tab of my spreadsheet above, you can see how these return scenarios play out given different prices at expiration. **Note that the option prices listed here do not automatically update. You will need to update them with real-time quotes.** 

Explore and decide what is best for you. Personally, I am holding Jan 2023 $65 calls. 

I am not a professional investor and I mostly learn by researching company's  making a predictions and testing them by investing. I would appreciate any criticisms, added knowledge, or other ideas you're willing to provide. We all learn together

rareliquid,0.0,120.0,"Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.

Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting).

**Why ARK?**

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations**
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies 
   * To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point*** **for more research**

**My Process &amp; Selection Criteria**

* First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.
* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.
* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings):
   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 71%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26%
   * LTM revenue growth: 46%
   * LTM gross margins: 48%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36%
   * LTM revenue growth: 27%
   * LTM gross margins: 87%
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%)
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data.
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 57%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15%
   * LTM revenue growth: 33%
   * LTM gross margins: 53%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products

**Edit:** One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys. Just that they are attractive from a financial perspective + it helps that the ARK team vetted the company.",stocks,ARKK (Innovation Fund) Top 5 Stock Picks - Week Ending 3/7/21,120.0,0.95

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

-	SpaceX completed a raise of $850 million last week, people familiar with the financing told CNBC, sending the company's valuation to about $74 billion.

-	The company raised the new funds at $419.99 a share, those people said, or just a cent below the $420 price that Elon Musk made infamous in 2018.

-	SpaceX's latest raise also represents a jump of about 60% in the company's valuation from its previous round in August, when SpaceX raised near $2 billion at a $46 billion valuation.",stocks,"SpaceX reportedly raised $850 million, jumping valuation to about $74 billion",97.0,0.98

Hey everyone! I’m just a college student who got bored and wanted to find the fastest way to through away my loans. GME afforded me that opportunity, so now I’m going to try my hand at making money. Or at least analysis. I’ve been following AMD since they released Ryzen Gen 2. Intel had been sitting comfortable in the throne, barely improving chips (how long did they use 10 nm nodes lol?) each generation and hoarding cash because they didn’t have a competitor. Ryzen 2 changed that, Ryzen 3 made AMD the market leader, and I believe Ryzen 4 will solidify it. The difference is even though AMD is at the top, they haven’t slowed down improving their product. Intel got complacent and now they’re paying for it. Pigs.

Fundamentals:

EPS: 20.7

Market Capital: 113.6 Billion

Profit Margin: 25.5%

Operating Margin: 14.02%

Revenue: 9.763 Billion

Total Debt: 572 Million

Free Cash Flow: 777 Million

Let's start off with the easy part. AMD is raking in money. Their margins are growing and their finally feeling comfortable. At the beginning of 2016 AMD's already meager revenue was down 20% to 4.3 Billion, Intel controlled 82% of the CPU market, and Nvidia controlled near 80% of the GPU market. Fast forward to 2021, their revenue for 2020 is 9.8 billion and AMD controls 50.8% of the CPU [market](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/revenue). Which is more than Intel if you can't do math. That's a remarkable turnaround, and I think the trend will continue. There's still nobody who wants their gpu's, but that's okay. CPU's are their forte, GPU's are just extra cash. For the most part I will compare AMD, INTC, and NVDA because those two are AMD’s biggest competitors. I’ll start with P/E, it goes Intel last w/ 12.5, AMD middle at 45.5, and Nvidia way ahead at 132. No one has been able to challenge Nvda for Market leader in something like two and a half decades, so this is not surprising. However, AMD’s revenue has increased 45% in the last year compared to Nvda’s going down nearly 7%. Intel’s margin is still slightly higher at 55% and AMD at 45, but AMD just began pricing at a higher cost than Intel, so I expect that to change. There is a large discrepancy in the P/B ratio: INTC at 2.36%, NVDA at 12.56% and coming in at the top, AMD at 19.05%. However, we are in a historic bull run, and [Jerome Powell](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00n6xPgB2VSYgvh3QW6B6IjOz0sUQ:1613338536956&amp;q=Jerome+Powell&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3yIo3LjK1fMRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uJC08Sxi5fVKLcrPTVUIyC9PzckBAK_YEhRWAAAA) said don’t worry about the interest rates, so I won't. Every stock looks overvalued, yet they keep going up, so I think AMD is still undervalued relatively. They beat earning predictions by 10% last quarter, and projected that they grow by 37% vs the consensus of 27% this year. AMD has a measly 113 Billion market cap contrasted to 250 billion for Intel and 370 billion for Nvidia. Yet AMD is still taking market share away in both the CPU and GPU sector. Every time I’ve bet against Elon Musk or Lisa Su I’ve lost, so now I’ll ride her coattail to $110. The stock has been flirting with the all-time high for the last week, and I think it’ll jump to $110ish, retreat back to high 90’s, then climb back to $120 where it will settle. Let's go over the good and bad. In 2016

We all know about the supply issues. It's a widespread issue and no one knows really when it will end. One good sign is Biden committed to signing an executive order to conduct a supply chain review and develop a long-term strategy to avoid future shortages. I’m not sure if it will have any tangible short-term effects on either the stock price, or the supply but I do believe it will increase investor confidence. If the government backs it, it literally can’t go tits up. (To be clear, the government is backing the semiconductor supply chain, not AMD. They could go tits up, but I really doubt it.) Another good sign was at the CES keynote, Lisa Su said they’re expecting “tightness in the first half of the year,” meaning supply will be back to normal in the second half of the year? But take this with a grain of salt because back in early 2020, she said supply would be back to normal by Q4 2020. It’s entirely possible supply will return since covid is receding everywhere except the US. There’s a lot of money on the table right now for whoever can get hardware out. She also said they’re investing in new facilities to avoid this problem so hopefully between the new factories and government intervention their supply chain will be future proof for a while.

I’m not sure where what paragraph to talk about this under, so it’s getting its own. Up until their exemption expired two months ago, AMD was paying 7% tariff rates on certain good from China that most other people had to pay 25%. Biden didn’t extend the discount and he hasn’t committed to repealing or leaving the taxes in place. This will impact their margins significantly.

I think the supply issues are overplayed. Obviously it’s a large issue, but it’s not entirely because the supply has gone dry. There was a perfect storm in 2020 between COVID, the PS5, Xbox, AMD/Nvidia GPU’s, Intel/AMD CPU’s, automobile manufacturers, and the tech industry booming. Covid added on to that. Covid simultaneously caused a significant boom in demand for electronics and disrupted supply.

The Semiconductor Industry Association said sales for semiconductors would rise 8.4 percent in 2021, which is 164% the growth rate in 2020 ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)). A notable jump when there were 433 billion semiconductors sold in 2020. I’ll do the math for you. That’s 710 billion semiconductors being sold during a ‘supply shortage’ this year. Imagine how many would have been sold if supply kept up with demand. Every device has multiple chips. Chips to control the display, manage power, operate connections, or pick up location. And demand is only going to skyrocket as more electronics/sensors are put into more things. On top of that, short supply is a better problem to have than exorbitant excess of quickly depreciating assets. Trying to guess how much of a product you need is tricky, then when companies realized there weren’t going to be enough semiconductors to go around they all tried to get theirs, and in turn increased the discrepancy between supply and demand. The last cause I felt worthwhile to put in here is the tariff war Trump had with China. Trump bared the biggest foundry in China from getting advanced chip manufacturing gear and barred US companies from dealing with them. This also decreased the supply of semiconductors substantially. China still may have an impact though, they announced that semiconductors will make up a substantial portion of its “Made in China 2025” plan. They are currently aiming to produce 70% of the conductors used in China, the majority through SMIC, and have backed their statements up with billions of dollars. However, they’re still far behind private companies though and SMIC has been successfully sued for intellectual property theft on two separate occasions, the first for $135 million, the second for 200 million, 8% of shares to TSMC with the option to obtain around 10% should they think about stealing again. So, I wouldn’t count on this. Should SMIC find a way to make 7nm chips while it’s still the standard, and get around US restrictions, they could provide relief to a thin supply chain right now and make a lot of money. I don’t think it’s likely it’ll happen soon enough to take advantage of the shortage, but I’ve learned to never count China out when it comes to making money. I’ll keep it here because of the possible impact given they figure it out.

Let’s move on to AMD’s near Future. They just released new chips and GPUs in the second half on 2020, so I wouldn’t expect any largely impactful releases soon. I expect them to finish out their product line with midrange GPU’s/CPU’s. Meh, whatever. What I’m excited about is Zen 4.It was scheduled to release late 2021, and in December 2020 they said they were still on schedule, then early this year it changed to sometime in 2022. I expect it to be early 2022 based on leadership sticking to the late 2021 timeline up until Dec 2020, but this is pure speculation. Leaks have Zen 4 forty percent faster than Zen 3. It’ll probably be closer to twenty-five percent, but I’m welcome to AMD surprising me. Even at twenty-five percent, Zen 4 will once again outclass anything Intel is putting out. Also, this will be the first release where AMD is already established as the market leader. Zen 2 let everyone know they were back, Zen 3 showed that it wasn’t a fluke, Zen 4 should cement that and farther sway market share. It’s being built on a 5 nm process node, something Intel hasn’t dreamed of yet. Intel will be outclassed for at least 2 years, likely closer to 5. They haven’t had to compete in so long they forgot what it was like. [Here](https://wccftech.com/amd-5nm-next-generation-zen-4-ryzen-epyc-cpus-to-feature-over-25-ipc-increase/) is a more detailed map of AMD’s releases in the next two ish years. A lot is unknown about Zen 4 now, but hopefully I’ll make enough money from AMD to get one and I’ll let y’all know how it is. They’ve also bought Xilinx for $35 Billion. Xilinx is a market leader in chips with logic gates. They are entirely different from chips we are familiar with today. They can be altered after leaving the factory. People can use this to specialize their CPU for a task. This show where AMD thinks the future of processors is and by having the market leader in that sector, AMD is already ahead. Not much has been said outside of there being a merger.

AMD has some stiff competition. I’ll focus on the CPU market then move to GPU’s, then smaller markets. There has been a shift toward ARM based processors recently: Apple M1, Qualcomm chips, Microsoft building one currently, and AMD had it in their plans but nothing else has been mentioned. They gave a window from 2017 – 2022, so It didn’t seem that important to them. I don’t see this affecting them or forcing them to switch over. Lisa Su was asked about it and she believes the x86 is still the future, so I’ll take her word for it. Who is Apple anyways? Anyways, arm powers the vast majority of mobile devices and high-powered embedded systems. Arm makes money selling the license to design chips based on their intellectual property. They have tech giants like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Nvidia all paying for the right, it’s undisclosed how much they are paying though. Maybe if we all pool our money we’ll have enough to partake in the fun. While not too important to AMD currently, it could be in the future. Nvidia announced they were buying ARM late 2020. If they succeed it will allow them not pay licensing fees anymore! In addition, they’re flirting with anti-competitive laws, aka a monopoly. All the companies currently leasing the ARM architecture are under strict guidelines restricting how much can be changes, and thereby restricting innovation. This hasn’t been a problem because everyone one had the sameish rules. Nvidia owning arm would give them control over those restrictions and handicap all other competitors. Should they desire to get into the smartphone market, they could innovate freely while restricting or just outright block others access to arm. Objections have been made based on anti-competitiveness by Qualcomm and Microsoft (lol). The deal is also being investigated by the UK, EU, and probably others. The US congress is on a well-deserved vacation for a while after doing nothing for the past 4 years so we’re sitting this one out it seems. Nvidia owning arm could have some scary repercussions. Since we’re focusing on AMD, if the deal goes through just assume AMD will have 0% market share in the mobile industry. Here’s some quick Nvidia DD, if deal = success: Buy.

On to Intel. According to [techspot](https://www.techspot.com/news/88507-intel-grabs-cpu-market-share-back-amd-first.html), AMD’s x86 market share fell from 20.1% to 19.3% even though the X86 market grew 20.1%. I attributed this to lack of supply. To back this up, consider Intel sales jumped the day after AMD said shortage will last at least several months.(10 minutes, maybe more!) I think people were waiting for AMD to resupply, then when they found out there wouldn’t be stock for a few months, they bought Intel. As a whole AMD’s market share declined .7% in Q4 but was up 6.2% for 2020. Now let's walk through what Intel’s up to. They got a new CEO finally. It was going to be another sears if that didn’t happen. Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO, seems pretty solid. I’m seeing comparisons to Steve Jobs returning to Apple. Pat didn’t start Intel, it’s not his child, so I don’t see how that works. But he could reinvigorate some life. He began as an Intel quality-control tech when he was 18. He got his bachelors from Santa Clara, then his masters from Stanford, all while moving up the ranks at Intel. Not bad. He ended up working at Intel for 30 years, which happens to be how long Intel will be using 10nm processors. Also he was the first ever Chief of Technology Officer for Intel from 2000-2005. I’m not sure what that is and I don’t have the energy to look, but most positions with a C in front are important, or at least well paid. He was the CEO for VMware up until a few days ago, and they seem to being doing well, current stock price of $145, no massive amounts of debt or anything. Nothing wild, stable growth. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/patgelsinger?challengeId=AQEEh2JtIcpqrgAAAXei0TxLObNVwusIH5OQIEz5fQ0IhjxFtNNGjXVQUjKWuSrCf6Ys6H8bh0Apq1z-FXymHtqn4g3dC1A4Xg&amp;submissionId=611eae20-25c0-6316-847c-037cbaa1386a) is his LinkedIn if you want to check it out. He takes over Intel on the 15th of February (the day after I’m writing this). The stock went up 11% after the announcement came out, giving a necessary break from the constant stream of bad news out of Intel recently. Pat Gelsinger hasn’t said anything of his plans for Intel outside of “make better products” 4head. I’ve read a few articles that claimed he would pretty much stick to Intel status quo, but I disagree. What’s interesting is he has been offered high positions by Intel between when he left and when he comes back tomorrow but he supposedly he turned them down because he couldn’t change things. Which goes directly against sticking to the status quo. Even still, he’s not God and he can’t make 7nm chips out of bread and water so while he might be the catalyst in an upward trend for Intel on the long long haul, they aren’t doing well now.

Intel plans to release their 11th-generation Rocket Lake Processors as early as mid-March (unconfirmed by Intel, subject to change). This seems positive as AMD can’t supply enough processors so ideally Intel fills this gap. Unfortunately, the chips still suck. Benchmarks have been leaked, [here](https://premiumbuilds.com/comparisons/intel-i9-11900k-vs-i9-10900k-vs-ryzen-9-5900x/) is a “good” comparison to AMD. I’ll summarize for those that don’t want to read. Do your own research people, I could spout some bs right now and you wouldn’t know any better. Anyways, Intel’s best 11th gen is about 20% better than their best 10th gen if the benchmarks are to be trusted. I expect they’re cherry picking which specific CPU they’re benching and giving it every possible advantage. A lot of the system info given on the benchmark is blurred out. I suspect they blurred everything other than the speed, socket, and chip to hide that they blew their budget on their cpu and couldn’t afford a good gpu. Ta da, both me and Intel are using a 1070. (: If you scroll a little bit on the link above you’ll see a “good” comparison to AMD’s last gen chips, I’ve been writing for around five hours and can’t be bothered to summarize, to I’ll just quote it.

Even when it comes to competing with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X, which is priced in the range of the i9-10900K, the i9-11900K is about 9% faster in single core speeds. Of course, the i9-11900K will severely lack in multi core speeds, as it is missing four cores and eight threads. Also, if the leaked clock speeds are to be trusted, the i9-11900K will have a significantly faster boost clock speed, reaching 5.3 GHz, versus the 4.8 GHz of the Ryzen 9 5900X. But if we are to compare the i9-11900K with a Ryzen CPU that has an equivalent number of cores and threads – which in this case is the Ryzen 7 5800X – we see that it has a 12% faster single-core speeds, and just about the same multi-core scores.”

I put quotations around good because this is bad. Intel’s next gen chips should not be competing with AMD’s last gen chips. To give an easier frame of reference, here’s an example of how next gen chips should measure up at minimum. I compared last gen i9-9900K (Intel's Best 9th gen chip released Oct 2018) vs Ryzen 7 1800X (AMD’s best 1’st gen Ryzen released March 2017) \*I’m ignoring the Threadripper line because they are targeted at a different, smaller audience. [Results](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-7-1800X-vs-Intel-i9-9900K/2966vs3334). As you can see, the i9 beats the 1800x in every category except thread/core count because Intel refuses to move into the future. And this is pretty much Intel’s best processer they will be releasing until 2023. Pat has stated that Intel is figuring out how to make 7nm chips much quicker now but what is he supposed to say? “I don’t know how tf Bob Swan managed to lose this much market share in 2 years when Intel was so far ahead of AMD.” No, he needs to say something that inspires confidence in new leadership. When Bob Swan was Ceo 7nm chips were pushed back until 2023, and I’m not sure Pat has the power to advance a timeline that quickly. They’re taking a backseat until they cough up 7nm processors or tap a different market. To show how confident AMD is in their position, they priced chips above their intel counterpart after making Intel slash prices one-two years ago. They have the superior product and finally have the recognition to act like it. Intel has been relegated to the budge chip for a few years minimum. Because if you think Zen 4 won’t blow whatever Intel is about to release, you’re wrong. Intel will also be releasing Alder Lake in the 4th quarter of 2021. I couldn’t find any leaks or information about it but I assume it’ll be 10nm just like the rest of their chips. For those that don’t know, the smaller you can make the processor the faster clock speeds you’ll get, manufacturing cost go down, and quality improves. A quick example is: Say you have a wafer with 3 defects on it, but you can fit 100 processors on it, because they’re so small. You have 97 usable processors from this single wafer. While if you were Intel you could only fit one processor per wafer, and it’s unusable because there’s 3 defects on your processor. Exaggerated, but gets the point across I think.

One thing Intel has going for them is brand recognition. They were the market leader for more than a decade and did well to establish that. AMD was a great value brand. It will take a while for that sentiment to change, especially with those that don’t keep up with tech.

Last paragraph about Intel. I promise. Last fall Pat said if their factories can’t reliably deliver on processors, he’d consider outsourcing. The only suppliers realistically big enough for this are TSM or Samsung. TSM already makes chips for self-driving cars on behalf of Intel, so advantage TSM. I suspect circumstances have changed though because Pat Gelsinger stated during an earning call on 1/21/2021 that he was “confident the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally.” Given that they haven't started outsourcing, it’s possible. If they do outsource it was result in the loss of at least 30,000 jobs. I don’t know if they care about that though. Extra DD again, if the deal goes through, buy whoever gets it. Maybe buy TSM anyways. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-may-outsource-production-of-some-top-chips-to-samsung-tsmc-report) that Intel was in discussions w/ both companies to outsource products starting 2023. (I don’t' have a Bloomberg subscription, so I’m taking crn’s word for it.) Additionally, Intel was awarded a huge defense contract by the US government. Whoever managed that should get a raise. They’ve also entered a three-year collaboration with Sandia National Labs to fight nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Not sure if that’ll make them money or what.

The server market represents a lot of potential for AMD. Intel dominates the market with like 90% market share, but amd’s share increased from 5% to 8% in 2019 and is double digits in midway through 2020. This is the most recent accurate data I could [find](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/16/amd-is-about-to-double-down-on-a-huge-opportunity/). Their current market share doesn’t matter anyways. It’s not about where they’re at right now, it’s about where Lisa Su is going to take them. AMD showcased their 3rd gen server processors named “Milan” by pitching them in a weather prediction simulation against Intel’s Xeon Gold 6258R. The Milan was 68% faster in single-socket performance and 46% faster in dual socket. Now, I know, I know. “Wtf you just bitched about Intel comparing their top-of-the-line next gen cpu with old hardware. Yes I did. I think this is different because AMD blew them out of the water. The presentation was given by AMD, so everything was hand-picked in their favor, but it’s still impressive. If you’re skeptical about it, good. Wait until Intel releases their server chip and see how the two compare. But guess what. The Milan is based on a 7 nm node. It was pitted against a 14 nm node, and Intel’s new server cpu will be ….......10 nm. Morons. If they can take away a significant portion of the server, Intel could start to lose their hold as the staple processor. Who knows what will happen then? Rain upwards? Walk on your hands? Me passing CS? Doubt it.

We can run though laptops quickly. AMD is releasing their 4000 series sometime this year, hopefully it’ll be good. Intel is still entrenched in this market and they have a lot of support from people like Dell and HP who keep putting overpriced underperforming Intel chips in their best computers and limiting AMD processors w/ weaker hardware. But again, AMD market share here went up 10%, so we might be seeing the shift happen. I looked up the best laptops to buy because that what I imagine people who don’t understand tech do. The top 3 on nearly all websites are Mac’s or Intel driven. I think that just shows mainstream sentiment hasn’t changed much. Or maybe I was looking up all my Intel data before then, so then they recommended all Intel. The mobile market followed a similar trend, just imagine everywhere I put laptops it says mobile.

Lastly, the graphics card market. Their 10-K doesn’t say a lot about it or what they plan to do. Just that they are competing with Nvidia, Intel is developing their own high-end gpus. Of topic, but both Nvidia and Intel are trying to break into each other's respective markets. Nothing serious has come out about Intel’s GPU’s so I can’t tell you much about that. Nvidia is the market leader, there is no question in this market. AMD was in the same position vs Intel five years ago, so it’s possible, but hard. Intel slowed down innovating, Nvidia has not. AMD cards also have a bad reputation of being buggy and having bad drivers. Nvidia has a nice program in Gforce and GSync. I don’t see AMD leading this market unless Nvidia hands it to them. However, they have a few things going for them. Competition is good for the industry and I think people realize that after Intel didn't innovate until they were forced to. There's also a large entry barrier, so it's unlikely they'll have to compete with anyone outside of Nvidia and Intel. And I'd give Intel at least a few generations to work out the kinks. It ends up being Nvidia vs AMD for a few years minimum and I believe AMD will take some market share. Not lead, but hold their own.

Consoles were a big win for AMD in 2020. They won contracts to provide chips for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Sales between the two equate to 9-10 billion dollars. However, both console sales have been trending down while Switch sales have been trending up for the past three [years](https://www.vgchartz.com/article/442352/switch-vs-ps4-vs-xbox-one-global-lifetime-salesjanuary-2020/). Particularly the Xbox. I’ve the argument that as consoles catch up to PC performance they will take market share [away](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/290387-report-20-million-pc-gamers-could-switch-to-consoles-by-2022). I don’t agree with this analysis but I put it in here so you can choose for yourself. My reasoning is:

1. Cross play is becoming common, don’t have to get a console to play w/ console friends,
2. PC has a higher entry barrier usually, but last longer, and can upgrade one or two things at a time for a few hundred dollars instead of getting an entire new system
3. Not that many must-have exclusives anymore (Microsoft punching the air right now)
4. I’m not sure how the Switch fits in, Nintendo is always a wild card to me. Also, the KFC console hasn’t set a release date, but if it does drop I can see the market shifting on its head and going 100% toward KFC. It will be powered by Intel. I’m not actually sure I would want my brand associated with KFC, but Intel didn’t ask me for some reason. That sounds like something a 60 year old guy names Bob Swan would do.

In conclusion, I think AMD will be the market leader in CPU’s for at least 8 years. I think their stock will keep bouncing for a while until the supply squeeze goes away, then earning will come out, Intel will be broke, and AMD will laugh all the way to the bank. There are a few big ifs, the supply chain being fixed, the ARM deal, and figuring out what Intel's new CEO is up to.

I noticed that my broker indicated that from 9:30 today until 20:00 Feb 16 this stuck is traded under SEC 201 rule, meaning that short sellers are not allowed to sell under the highest bid price. It is interesting twhat this simple rule unveiled about this stock: that it is not going down because there is something wrong with the fundamentals, but it is going down because short-sellers are forcing it to. As soon as this rule was executed, the stock started going back up to $3.7 (as of now) from $2.80 in the first 5 minutes of the market (before Rule 201 was imposed and it was going down hard with heavy volume \[aka short sellers\]). This means that there are more bulls than bears behind this stock, right?

As another example in contrast to this one, the same thing happened to AEZS on Feb 9 or 10, after a spike in price. But this time the price kept going down, meaning that the price was too high even for the bulls. Is that a correct way to think about this? I appreciate your feedback.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

psychotrader00,0.0,88.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 2, 2021**

Stocks retreated on Tuesday, pulling back after rallying yesterday, underscoring how volatile the market is right now. Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \[economic\] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. 

Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March. 

In Washington D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that the House of Representatives recently passed this week, though he did not specify when a vote would be held. 

**Highlights**

* Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, “RKT’s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock – GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.""
* After posting strong earnings and rising more than 8% after-hours yesterday, Zoom’s (ZM) stock price cratered today, with the stock going from 8% up to more than 9% down in today’s session.
* After posting disappointing earnings, NIO’s stock also cratered today, falling more than 12% in today’s session.
* After the recent controversies, Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack MA is now the fourth richest person in China, falling from first place. 
* In a memo to employees, Ant Group’s executive chairman Eric Jing said an IPO was still in the cards.
* Vizio Holdings, a maker of smart TVs, has filed for an IPO. The company has sold 82.2 million televisions and 11.8 million sound bars since its founding in 2002, the prospectus said.

I think we all agreed about the moving of the us stock market has great impact on the crypto market, but how about the opposite? 

Before people don’t think crypto market can influence the stock a lot, but now things are changing. 

If we look back to what happening in the last few  weeks or months, we can clearly see the connection between stock market and the crypto market are fundamentally changed, because those crypto companies like $riot are actually in the stock market now, not only a concept sort thing. And also companies like $tsla are publicly admitted they invested in the crypto. So the moving of the crypto market will directly influenced the price of those companies and the influence the whole stock market.

This totally changed the big picture. We can imagine, since the us stock market only opens in the the certain time, but the crypto markets is 24/7, and also the other big players Chinese and Europeans are totally in different time zone, the impact between those traders are delayed, so it’s possible making a feedback loop. Think about if a investment institution invested in $BTC a few days ago. Then the stock market start moving down. Then they have to dump some $BTC to make up the loss, then drive the crypto market down, then at night the European Chinese might consider dumping a bit to avoid the risk as the market going down. The. The next morning the institution sees the BTC going down, he might need to dump some stocks to make up the loss of the $BTC. 

So the trend might be enhanced by this loop, up or down, either way could be. And that might explain the moving of the market in the last few days and foreshadowing the future.

$CAH  - this is a strong support, no real trendline here. It did break the 200EMA so keep that in mind. All indicators are low, so will this hold? Either way, very low risk play here.

$EMP  - Great beginner play. Only 5-6% reward but very low risk as well. Great support area here. All indicators super low which is great.

$HLIT - Gorgeous channel up, but the 50EMA broke. 200 is near by, but we have a beautiful support line here too. Indicators low, so I think a reversal is near.

$MAS  - gorgeous channel right and up; it is showing higher lows. Indicators are fair, but the price action here is absolutely beautiful.

The PDF of my full DD (**19 pages but easy to read**) can be downloaded here: [link](https://ln2.sync.com/dl/1b6673550#njmc5ixz-8iyw2ump-4bde2e78-qzrvq677).

Below is a summary of my DD.

&amp;#x200B;

# Orange Business Overview

In one sentence, Orange is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. It has 266 million customers worldwide, employs 89,000 people in France, and 59,000 elsewhere. It is the tenth largest mobile network operator in the world and the fourth largest in Europe after Vodafone, Telefónica and VEON. The company seems currently undervalued.

**Because Orange is pretty huge, I will only focused on Orange 5G + FTTH, and Orange Cyberdefense.**

&amp;#x200B;

Orange develops and markets many  families of services:

1. Residential, personal and business communication services: landline, internet (modem, ADSL, optical fiber - FTTH), VoIP, videotelephony, digital television and multimedia content (ex: VoD)
2. Personal communication services, i.e. cell phones.
3. Business communication services: Orange Business Services ([link](http://www.orange-business.com/)). It operates in over 220 countries and territories and employs over 21,000 employees in 166 countries. Over the last few years, 700 million euros were invested in research and development with dedicated 8,000 employees including scientists, engineers, developers, designers, sociologists and marketers. Orange certified partners include Microsoft, Splunk, Cisco, Amazon Web Service, VMWare, Dell, Cisco. 
4. Banking services: Orange Bank. I don’t know much about this one.
5. Orange Money: mobile money service of Orange S.A., available in most of the group's affiliates in Africa. Its users can deposit money into an account linked to their mobile phone number, and then access a range of services, in particular transferring money domestically and internationally, paying bills and buying airtime top-up.
6. Domotics: [link (french)](https://boutique.orange.fr/maison/domotique/). I don’t know much about this one either.
7. Orange Cyberdefense: [link (UK)](https://www.orange.com/en/newsroom/press-releases). Works mainly with the private sector. Acquired  SecureData and SecureLink in 2019 ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/uk/blog/uncategorized/when-forces-unite-our-rebrand-journey-to-orange-cyberdefense/)).

&amp;#x200B;

# Orange Business Model

&amp;#x200B;

* Convert existing ADSL clients to optical fiber
* **“Convergence” (see PDF)**: Make clients use Orange as an ISP **and** as a mobile network carrier by giving discount if you are already an Orange Customer
* Develop software for Orange Cyberdefense
* Acquire cybersecurity company to develop Orange Cyberdefense (see bull case)

&amp;#x200B;

# The Bull Case

* Orange’s internet access (ADSL, FTTH) is the best in France.
* News of 09 feb. 2021: Partnership agreement with OVHcloud. OVHCloud is a French cloud computing company that offers VPS, dedicated servers and other web services.
* Orange Sells 50% Stake In €2.67B Fibre Project For Rural France. France Orange SA announced an exclusive agreement to divest 50% of its fixed fibre assets for about €1.3 billion ($1.58 billion) to help rollout networks in rural France ([link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/orange-sells-50-stake-in-eu2.67b-fibre-project-for-rural-france-2021-01-24)).
* Orange’s main competitor is Free. Free will offer 5G packages at the same price as 4G, while offering wide coverage of the territory (cf. Bear Case below). However, the bandwidth will be much less than Orange’s 5G ([link](https://www.ariase.com/mobile/carte-5g))
* Orange is working to make an European tower company ([slide p. 15](https://www.orange.com/sites/orangecom/files/2020-10/Q3%2020%20Presentation%20-%20EN%20-%20vdef.pdf)).
* Orange Cyberdefense is a strong asset during the lockdown. Moreover, 24 Jan. 2019, it obtained the PDIS certification (Security Incident Detection Service Providers Certification — Prestataire de Détection d’Incidents de Sécurité). In 2019, Orange Cyberdefense revenue increased by 24% ([link](https://www.hebergementwebs.com/orange/orange-is-considering-listing-orange-cyberdefense-on-the-stock-market)). In the first half of 2020, Orange Cyberdefense's revenues also recorded an increase of 11%, despite forecasts. Some more interesting news:
   * **11 Jun. 2020**: Orange Cyberdefense Launches Malware Cleaner in The United Kingdom and South Africa ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/uk/news/security-intelligence/orange-cyberdefense-launches-malware-cleaner-in-the-united-kingdom-and-south-africa/)). “Widely in use throughout Europe by local government, defense contractors, energy providers, automotive manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and their global satellite offices, Malware Cleaner adds a layer of reassurance preventing malware traversing from USB devices and Android mobile phones into internal networks.”
   * **17 Apr. 2020**: AkzoNobel partners with Orange Business Services to drive digital transformation with secure end-to-end global connectivity services ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/uk/news/uncategorized/akzonobel-partners-with-orange-business-services-to-drive-digital-transformation-with-secure-end-to-end-global-connectivity-services/)). “Solution includes software-defined networking and security services, including a CyberSOC IT/OT network convergence driven by productivity and operational security requirements “
   * **11 Jul. 2019**: SecureLink now officially part of the Orange family ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/be/news/orange-cyberdefense/securelink-now-officially-part-of-the-orange-family/)). “SecureLink, based in the Netherlands, is one of the largest independent cybersecurity services providers in Europe, with on-the-ground presences in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Denmark and Norway. Founded in 2003, SecureLink provides a full range of cybersecurity services to support its clients. Its offering includes specialised security consulting, security maintenance and support with 24/7 service desks (SOCs) as well as advanced managed detection and response capabilities (MDR). The group is also a leading value-added reseller of security software and hardware solutions, holding more than 1,000 technical or sales accreditations with blue chip security vendors. With over 660 employees and 14 offices, SecureLink recorded IFRS revenues of €248m in 2018 and served over 2,100 customers across a broad range of industries” ([source](https://orangecyberdefense.com/be/news/orange-cyberdefense/orange-signs-an-agreement-to-acquire-securelink/)).
* Orange doesn’t really have a competitor in France. Free, SFR and Bouygues Telecom are competitors of Orange only regarding mobile and FTTH. However, Orange has multiple services its competitors don’t or partially have: Orange Bank, Orange Money, Orange Cyberdefense.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Bear Case

## Multiple controversies in the history of the company (cf. Wikipedia)

## Past CEO

* **2008 January - 2011 April: Staff suicide**. On December 20, 2019 former CEO Didier Lombard and Orange were found guilty of moral harassment towards their employees.
* **21 March 2007 -  August 2008: Controversies in the UK regarding the quality of service**. On 21 March 2007 Watchdog, a television series by the BBC focusing on consumer protection, published the results from a broadband survey they held. According to the survey Orange is the worst ISP in the UK. 68% of Orange customers that took part in the survey said they were unsatisfied with Orange's customer service, it was voted as the most unreliable broadband provider, and it had the highest number of dissatisfied customers. Two thirds of Orange customers experienced problems cancelling their Orange broadband.In August 2008, after well publicised problems with iPhone 3G performances, customers compared their download speed and discovered that Orange in France was capping 3G download bandwidth. Orange admitted capping to 384kbit/s, well below the theoretical 7.2Mbit/s provided by the iPhone. Orange uncapped 3G and 3G+ by mid-September 2008.
* **2009: Accusations of false advertising in France**. Three users lodged a complaint against Orange for false advertising concerning its ""Unlimited 3G Key"" service. These customers criticised the operator for the misleading way in which this service is presented, since it isn't in fact unlimited. While it is true that there is no time limit, the user cannot download more than 1 gigabyte per month, thus limiting browsing. Unaware of this, the three plaintiffs browsed beyond plan limits and had to pay additional fees as a result.

## Current CEO

* **2011: Access to some sites limited**. Following complaints by Internet users, Megaupload accused Orange of not providing sufficient connectivity to its site, thus severely limiting throughput from France, an allegation Orange denied.
* **January 2011: SMS and MMS propagation of 1 January 2011 in France**. Orange users’ SMS and MMS were sent and billed multiple times. The operator agreed to reimburse the excess costs to consumers, explaining that the error came from a ""third party operator"" (which turned out to be Bouygues Telecom), said not to have sent acknowledgements, which caused the messages to be resent. 
* **March 2011: Corruption in Tunisia.** The information website OWNI uncovered a questionable financial deal with “Marouane Mabrouk clan” that enabled the Orange group to acquire a 3G license.
* **28 July 2011: Anticompetitive practices in French overseas departments.** On 28 July 2011, the Competition Authority fined France Télécom €27.6 million for having improperly impeded the development of new competing operators in the French overseas departments (primarily Réunion).
* **2015 - 2016: Accusations of antisemitism and calls for boycott**. The French chairman and CEO of the Orange telecommunications company, Stéphane Richard said in Cairo regarding his company operations in Israel, ""Believe me, I would cancel the contract tomorrow if I could. We want to end this and to fix this; we don't want it."" Later, Orange announced its desire to discontinue use of its popular brand name by its Israeli operator Partner Communications Company. The president of the State of Israel Reuven Rivlin said in response ""Just yesterday Israel faced attacks from anti-Israel and anti-Semitic bodies, who have chosen to delegitimize the state of Israel, and to launch rockets at us from the Gaza Strip. We must face these challenges together, right and left,"" Rivlin said. Israeli culture minister Miri Regev said, ""I call on Jews of France and the world to disconnect from Orange unless Stéphane Richard takes back his words. In September 2015, Orange reaffirmed their commitment to Israel with an investment in Hola, a video distribution network. In February 2016, Orange and Partner decided to terminate their agreement. As a result, rebranding has resulted in Orange Israel becoming part of Partner. Richard rejected the accusation of antisemitism and went on the record to say, ""We \[Orange\] love Israel. This has absolutely nothing to do with the kind of political debate in which I don't want to be."" He said that the decision to withdraw from Israel was purely a business decision, not a political decision. The decision was to disallow companies to license the Orange brand that does not use Orange's services, which is the practice of the Israeli company Partner. Orange plans not to renew its contract with Partner once the terms of the contract are complete.

## Bearish news

* Orange and Free end talk ([link - FR](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/actualites/orange-met-fin-aux-discussions-sur-un-accord-de-partage-de-reseau-mobile-avec-free-c4e4a5dd736806e36e88a2dd49bfd38a?symbol=1rPORA)): Offensive on several fronts, Free has decided to offer 5G packages at the same price as 4G, while offering wide coverage of the territory. With aggressive prices and coverage of 40% of the population, it replicates the strategy that had been successful in 4G. Still on the national market, Iliad (parent company of Free) wishes to conquer the business segment, currently dominated by Orange and SFR. The group owns Scaleway, a cloud player, which allows it to position itself in this segment. Internationally, Iliad continued its European expansion: after Italy and Ireland, Free's parent company has invested in Poland, thus asserting itself as the sixth European operator. 
* 5G implementation was delayed because of Covid-19 ([US link](https://www.orange-business.com/en/blogs/5g-us-where-are-deployments-and-what-can-we-expect-next)).
* Earnings were impacted because of Covid-19.
* Orange is behind Free regarding 5G implementation, and is also more expensive (Orange lowest: €40/month, Free:  €20/month). Regarding 5G, Orange only has 742 sites when Free has 5640 sites. However Orange’s 5G sites are 78% 3.5 Ghz, while Free only has 5.7% 3.5GHz sites (579 sites for Orange, 322 sites for Free). Which means Orange’s sites have a better quality than Free regarding internet speed.
* Except buzz words, not much is detailed about Orange Cyberdefense. It is pretty new (since 2016), but that’s not an excuse to be that vague.
* Orange is considering listing Orange Cyberdefense on the stock market. “However, this solution could impose itself within the staff of the incumbent operator as a means of bringing up the Orange 's share price, which has been steadily declining for a year, during which time it was close to 15 euros, to be below 10 euros since the second half of August last.”

# Conclusion

To conclude this DD, I think Orange is undervalued because it’s P/E and P/CF ratio are low compared to this company's earnings, and even lower compared to Free (Iliad). It also has a lot of room to grow with FTTH + 5G and with Orange Cyberdefense: Orange mobile is present in many countries and so is Orange Cyberdefense. Orange does not really have a competitor except on the 5G/FTTH market : the “combo” Bank-Money-Cyberdefense does not exist in Orange’s competitors. I think Orange Cyberdefense will become a big player in the next 5-10 years.

However, I may be more cautious than analysts, because of Orange’s historical controversies, and if Orange Cyberdefense is listed on the stock market, the value or Orange (ORA.PA) will decline even further. It also makes sense to keep Orange Cyberdefense with Orange, since cybersecurity and telecoms are closely linked. I cannot find any announcement regarding Orange Cyberdefense listing on the stock market, and I can hardly find more than just buzzwords about Orange Cyberdefense (which technology does it use? Does it develop some SaaS or just buy startups? How many?). My advice is to wait to know if there is a public announcement about it. If you have any additional information let me know.

Regarding France’s 5G deployment, in the short term I think the lowest-income consumers will prefer going to Free since it’s less expensive and it costs the same as their 3G/4G subscription. Moreover, most people will not notice the low quality of the 5G deployed by Free compared to Orange’s 5G.

Nevertheless, Orange has the potential to challenge Free’s low cost 5G with Sosh: a low-cost mobile company owned by Orange. It may provide low 5G subscription in the future to counter Free’s low cost subscription.

Here is my estimations about Orange (ORA.PA) :

* **Short term (\~1-2 month(s))**: stabilisation around €9.7(±€0.2).
* **1 year**: long if Orange Cyberdefense stays in ORA.PA. I would say the company is worth €12.5 to €13, depending on how well Orange Cyberdefense and the 5G deployment are doing. If Orange cyberdefense is listed on the stock exchange, I'm bearish on ORA.PA to €7.5 or even €7.
* **long term (+ 5 years)**: very bullish if: 
   * 5G and FTTH continues to grow (this one is a no-brainer)
   * The controversies stop
   * Orange Cyberdefense stays with ORA.PA
   * Orange Cyberdefense objectives and activities become clearer
   * Orange Cyberdefense continues to grow, for example: 
      * development of SaaS like Splunk or SolarWinds; 
      * partnership with cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, OVH, Gandi).
      * development in other countries. To me, it should focus first on development in the USA, China, and Europe since the market is huge. Targeting the african continent could be a very interesting move too, since this continent is emerging.
   * Low cost 5G subscription with Sosh. With Sosh, Orange already challenges Free’s fees as an ISP.
   * If those “if” are satisfied, I am very bullish on Orange and I think €25 is the minimum target price in + 5 years, because Orange Cyberdefense will become a huge player and IoT security will be a challenge.

## My Position 

30/11/2020: $50 at €10.71, down 9.12% (-$4.56).

Yeah I made a DD for $50. 

Yeah I will do it again.

Bochingenuc,0.0,89.0,"SOS Ltd. is undervalued (imo) and unnoticed player in the crypto world. Its share price is now **$7.44** (actually \~$4 few days ago). I am writing this post because I think this stock has potential for a huge profit when comparing to stocks already grew up like **MARA ($38)** and **RIOT ($49)**. I am certain that $SOS can actually hit **$30** in the near future.

**TL;DR at the bottom**

Crypto is getting more and more attention when **Cathie Wood** and **Elon Musk** being bullish on it. **Tesla** bought about **1.5b** of BTC and is going to accept it as a payment method. BTC hit its ATH and helped MARA and RIOT explode. As BTC's price going up, it will also help **$SOS going up**.

When comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS, you can find that $SOS has only gone up around 250% (actually only 100% few days ago) when $MARA, $RIOT going up over **1500%** and **1100%** respectively in the last three months. $SOS is just a train with **untapped potential**.

When comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS then we can see that $SOS has been unnoticed so far and with those two companies going up over **1500% and 1100%** respectively in the last three months while SOS has only gone up around 200%. This is just **untapped potential**.

$SOS has a market cap of $484 million. Take a look at others like MARA and RIOT. MARA currently has a market cap of $3.6b and RIOT has a $3.3b market cap. With the catalysts I will mention below, I can see $SOS going at least **5x** this year from the current price. For the sake of being conservative, I will only give it a **price target of $30**. (Market cap \~$2b)

***About SOS Limited***

SOS is an emerging block-chain-based and big data-driven marketing and solution provider, with a nationwide membership base of approximately **20 million** in China. Recently, SOS has outlined its strategy in **block-chain and crypto**, which include a series of initiatives to expand its business into crypto mining as well as **crypto security and insurance**. The core infrastructure of SOS' marketing data, technology and solutions to insurance and emergency rescue services is built on big date, block-chain-based technology, cloud computing, AI, satellite, and 5G network, etc. We have created a SOS cloud emergency rescue service software as a service (SaaS) platform with three major product categories: basic cloud, cooperative cloud, and information. This system provides innovative marketing solutions to clients such as insurance companies, financial institutions, medical institutions, healthcare providers, auto manufacturers, security providers, senior living assistance providers, and other service providers in the emergency rescue services industry.

SOS Ltd. is a **first of its kind** in the crypto industry. SOS is the first **crypto insurance**, **crypto bank** and on top of that they're also **mining crypto**. They're mining BTC and ETH. Their goal is to be the first complete **crypto institution**.

Recently they just bought a **cloud computing company** which is capable enough to mine **3-4** **BTC daily and over 50 ETH**. Now with the rising value of crypto their revenue is only going to keep going up.

Announced on February 5th, SOS Ltd. entered a framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower station in Heijang to secure **cheap and renewable electricity** for its cloud crypto mining center.

Adding on top of that, February 9th, they announced their receipt of **5000 pcs of Mining rigs** which arrived ahead on schedule. This rigs can generate about **BTC Hash Power 175P and** **ETH Hash Power 350G**. If these machine operates as expected, **the annual ROI (return on investment) is projected to be significant based on the current crypto price momentum**. The seller also confirmed that they have enough inventories of crypto mining rigs and that they can fulfill the next two batches of shipments as scheduled. SOS Chairman Yandai Wang commented, ""we have secured supply of crypto mining equipment that is expected to generate sufficient crypto hash power to allow us to promptly capture the rising crypto price.""

$SOS actually purchased **15645** Mining Rigs. They have another **10645** Mining Rigs on the way which will provide good news as catalysts in the future when they arrive. From my understanding, MARA only has near amount of mining rigs right now but is valued at 10x $SOS current price.

$SOS just announced a $110 million direct offering on 12 Feb. This sent the price down to **$5.48 (-13%)** before it promptly skyrocketed back up to close at **$7.44, up 18%** from the previous day despite the offering.

$SOS has announced intent to acquire FXK Tech Corporation(""FXK""), a Canadian-based company, specializing in the block-chain technology consulting and operations and support for crypto exchanges and cloud crypto algorithmic power exchanges, to further extend SOS ecosystem of block-chain and crypto, **as well as to expand its operations to North America.**

***Financials***

SOS Ltd.'s balance sheet is just beautiful. Here we can see that they have a really good amount of cash in hand to improve and their debt is only \~$200k.

[Balance sheet source](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sos/statistics/)

Market cap is 484m with the share price of $7.44 as of market close 12.02.2021.

If we take a look at the performance of the stock we can see that it hasn't had its boom yet unlike $MARA and $RIOT who have gained over 1000% in the last few months. This gives me **more confidence** that there might be a **breakout** soon when more people find out about this company.

$SOS is projected to make more than **$277k USD/day** in revenue once all **15645** Mining Rigs are running. This is projected from the current crypto prices (Actually it's only $200k USD/day before tesla bought BTC, the price of BTC is going up). So you can understand the potential of $SOS.

***Technical indicators***

The technical indicators are also looking positive. We're seeing a **good volume increase** which usually indicates a breakout soon and it getting more traction. We recently just **broke the last resistance** ceiling as well and we are in a continuous **upwards trend** at the moment. Volume increase is also usually a **bullish indicator**.

**Summary/TL;DR**

SOS Ltd. is a stock which **has not boomed yet** (or just started to boom maybe) in this bull market. We still have chance to get on the train before it leave the station. SOS has a great balance sheet and positive technical indicators showing an **upwards trend** at the moment.

**SOS's revenue will increase** by each year as we can expect BTC and ETH to soar in the next few years, probably even few months as BTC just hit a new **ATH**. BTC has a lot more confidence now growing as well since the most well known and richest man on Earth, **Elon Musk**, just invested into BTC worth $1.5b.

With good performance this week, we can expect it to do better in the future.

Position: 1800 @ $5.5

Unfortunately for those reading this post but not yet holding $SOS, this post maybe a little bit late. $SOS announced an offering on Friday (yesterday), so it was the best time to buy the dip (although it actually close at up 18% finally). I bought in at $5.5 yesterday. I am 90% sure that $SOS will blow up next week and it may be hard to find an entry point. Its stock price somehow managed to go up with offering news......

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday’s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday’s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&amp;P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.

&gt; * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday’s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&amp;P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.

*****

&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.

*****

&gt; # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage

&gt; * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill — which is seen passing the House on Friday — on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.

*****

&gt; # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&amp;J’s single-shot Covid vaccine

&gt; * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn’t have to follow the vaccine committee’s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies’ two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.

*****

&gt; # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO

&gt; * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.

I’ve been seeing numerous comments about accounts being down 30-50% over the past month, which absolutely blows my mind. I’m going to sound like a boomer here, but situations like this month is why you have lower beta stocks or ETFs, like the... SPY! sure, your upside is limited relative to QQQ or ARKK, but there’s less downside risk as well. If you take the huge 30-50% drawdown, it becomes even more difficult to Get back to where you were.

SnooObjections2665,0.0,80.0,"I think that cybersecurity will be this years winner (yes, maybe even more than semi-conductors). I want to pick 3 stocks to hold for the next 5+ years. I have a brief description (from yahoo finance I know...) what they do, my suggestions are: 

  
**CRWD - Crowdstrike Holdings.** provides a broad spectrum of solutions with their main aim being intrusion and breach prevention, such as some of the breaches they helped investigate – high-profile cases such as Sony Pictures and the DNC.

**FTNT** \- **Fortinet**  is one of the dominant players in the Unified Threat Management (UTM) space, which is one of the fastest-evolving segments in the network security space.

The company’s ability to meld next-generation, cloud-based firewalls with SD-WAN allows it to grab an early lead in the SASE market. Its Opaq Networks buyout in July will act like a catalyst. Also, this company has been gaining from heightening cyber-attack risks that are propelling demand for its FortiMail platform.

**PANW - Palo Alto Networks** is a giant when it comes to providing firewalls and various cloud-based services to extend the functionalities of these firewalls. They have a multinational market, outperforming even Cisco in this year’s second quarter.

Equally, when it comes to trading, the number of bullish hedge fund positions moved up by 8 in recent months. The company was in 59 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020. The all time high for this statistics is 52. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock **currently sits at its all time high**.

**OKTA: Okta** provides identity authentication services. This means building a way to verify and enforce who accesses what at any given time, from your run-of-the-mill passwords to biometrics. Okta has been a strong up-and-comer since last year it almost doubled its revenue and beat analysts’ predictions by some $11 million.

Starting with a mainly SMB-oriented client pool, Okta has since leveled up to serving **over 1400 enterprises** with **revenue over $100 000** out of 8000 reported clients. This number continues to grow rapidly.

**NET** \- **Cloudflare**: is a leader in edge computing. It handles a good part of the traffic the average consumer goes through online today. With services such as DDoS mitigation and internet security, it acts like a reverse proxy between you and the websites you visit.

Aside from establishing itself as an internet power, Cloudflare had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange just last year. This year it has been one of the best-performing US stocks, currently **being found on 44 hedge fund portfolios**, way above its all time high of 33.

&amp;#x200B;

UnBonCitoyen,0.0,79.0,"First of all, yes this is a boomer stock but I like money.

So you're probably wondering why I'm writing about this stock and why it is undervalued right now (in my opinion). Let me point out the following things:

First of all, Brent oil is at a 12-month high and will even go higher ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/oil-refineries-shut-as-texas-energy-industry-reels-from-deep-freeze.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/oil-refineries-shut-as-texas-energy-industry-reels-from-deep-freeze.html)). The supply shrinks but the demand grows, refineries are closing due the cold weather (aka we're turning up the heat to keep ourselves warm). Shell has a break even price at $31, so with the current Brent price ($63) they are making $32 per barrel!!!

Secondly, there is still a lot of air traffic ([https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/travel/coronavirus-air-cargo-capacity](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/travel/coronavirus-air-cargo-capacity)) and once the pandemic is over, there will be even more commercial flights.

Shell is producing synthetic kerosene!!! This is a huge one, I'm surprised that this isn't getting more attention ([https://www.flightglobal.com/fleets/klm-carries-out-first-flight-part-powered-with-sustainable-synthetic-fuel/142326.article](https://www.flightglobal.com/fleets/klm-carries-out-first-flight-part-powered-with-sustainable-synthetic-fuel/142326.article)). Shell is focusing on their emission neutral transition, they have a bright future ([https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-shell-emissions/shell-sets-emission-ambition-of-net-zero-by-2050-with-customer-help-idUKKCN21Y0MN](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-shell-emissions/shell-sets-emission-ambition-of-net-zero-by-2050-with-customer-help-idUKKCN21Y0MN))

Lastly, Shell also sells natural gas, which is also peaking ([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19dabc60-9034-3569-a096-4802b26cffa4/natural-gas-prices-soar-amid.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19dabc60-9034-3569-a096-4802b26cffa4/natural-gas-prices-soar-amid.html)).

Bonus: 18th February is the ex-dividend date aka if you have shares at opening, you get a dividend.

So why is Shell's stock price so low? Negative sentiment, completely retarded people thought that they will go bankrupt because of the pandemic. Others are saying that we won't need oil and that green energy is sufficient... delusional lmao.

The real reasonable reason: the dividend cut they have done, this helps them to pay off their debt. BUT they will raise every year the dividend with 4% (or more). There is a big possibility of a share buy back when their debt goes below 65 billion, which might be very soon with these insanely growing oil prices.

TLDR: Oil up, Shell up

Undervalued, low risk, good reward.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.

7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy &amp; Financials hugely outperformed.

This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.

[Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications &amp; Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded.

So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it’s very likely we won’t see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It’s really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.

The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven’t seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.

This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings &amp; many others reporting this upcoming week.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany. This news, combined with [GM](https://imgur.com/SGIF2TL) and most other traditional OEM joining more &amp; more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla, Nio, Xpeng &amp; many others. I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick &amp; chose. I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the [price](https://imgur.com/tIxgkLk) of the model 3 and Y again &amp; Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants.

On the earnings side, we had [Palantir](https://imgur.com/EHDqE9f) reporting a beat on revenues, with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report, despite an in-line [guidance](https://imgur.com/ExRQ4DD) for the revenue growth of about 30% for 2021, with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year. It didn’t help the stock that the lock-up period of 80% of the remaining insider shares also expired, but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long-term, as it already started to recover, rising more than 15% on [Friday](https://imgur.com/TDBDIpw), after the [ARK](https://imgur.com/H8m7HBn) Innovation ETF added over 5M shares.

[Twilio](https://imgur.com/qhbS8Ln) also rose after beating both the top &amp; bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus, though they followed this with a stock [offering](https://imgur.com/JALCaI5) of over $1.5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop.

One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was [ROKU](https://imgur.com/j5gA32i), as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60% over last year. They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5-10% for 2021, moving the company into profitability finally.

But guys, the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant [Deere](https://imgur.com/qoXEacL), rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by $1.70 and increased their revenues by over 20% over last year, as they also [guided](https://imgur.com/OgcZT2b) for net income of up to $5B next year, compared to $2.75B in FY2020.

On the other hand, [Walmart](https://imgur.com/E2a8iOr) dropped 6% after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year, though they did announce a $20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield. I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to $15/hours from the current $11/hour, which will affect their earnings in the future.

So yeah folks, let’s hope for a better week in the stock markets again!

rareliquid,0.0,75.0,"Hi Everyone, below is a post about Lemonade, which has fallen 30%+ over the past few days. There’s a lot of hype around the stock, but based on my diligence, I think investors should **not** buy the dip.

**Q4 2020 Financial Results - The Good Stuff**

* I want to start this post actually with the positives for the company from the latest earnings. Numbers are from their [latest shareholder letter](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/169142121000019?cik=1691421)
* From 2019-2020, Lemonade’s **in force premium, increased by 87%** from $114 million to $213 million
   * This was driven by **higher premiums per customer ($213 in Q4 2020 vs $177 in Q4 2019)** and an impressive **56% year-over-year increase in number of customers (which now sits at \~1 million)**
      * If you’re not familiar with insurance, **premiums** are just the amount customers pay each month, so if you pay $10 a month for renter's insurance, your monthly premium is $10
      * The **in force premium is annualized,** so in our previous example, your in force premium would be $10 a month times 12 months which equates to $120 for your in force premium
   * Lemonade **started off as a disruptive rentals insurance company** but has since then launched new products including **homeowners, pets, and life insurance** and this is how the company has been able to increase the premium it charges per customer by cross-selling its products to the same customer
* The company also grew their **gross earned premium to $50 million** which represents a 92% year over year increase
   * Gross earned premium represents the amount of the in force premium Lemonade collects once the service is fully delivered
   * So for example, if a customer pays $10 on January 1st for 1 month of rental insurance, Lemonade's gross earned premium is $0 and only becomes $10 once the full month of January has passed
* The company’s **annual gross loss ratio also fell from 79% to 71%** (Q4 2019 to Q4 2020), signaling better operating margins
* Basically, Lemonade has experienced an increasing customer base, has been charging more per customer, leading to higher in force premiums
* In addition to this, management strongly hinted that it’s working on a new product that will launch later this year, and it’s most likely going to be car insurance (watch towards the end of this [video from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/02/lemonade-ceo-on-the-companys-quarterly-earnings-and-new-offerings.html) with LMND’s CEO)
   * This could be a significant revenue driver for the company and I do like that Lemonade is expanding aggressively into multiple products as long as the company can grow its customer base

**Q4 2020 Financial Results - The Bad Stuff**

* The first thing I need to do is set the stage by explaining the **company's sky-high valuation to explain why the stock plummeted 16% after earnings**
   * Right before earnings, the company was trading at $132 per share, which gave the company a market cap of $8.5BN. Adjusting for the company’s cash of $1.2BN (incorporates company’s latest follow-on offering), the company had an **enterprise value of $7.2BN**
   * In the most recent quarter, the company guided to a midpoint of $115.5 million in 2021 revenue. **This meant Lemonade was trading at a 63x 2021 revenue multiple,** which is higher than pretty much all of the fastest growing software companies in the world
      * Here’s a [list](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2172588b-b60a-427d-9815-f523942b2183_1145x631.png) of some of the fastest growing software companies in the world for reference
   * But that’s the thing, Lemonade is **NOT** a software company. Many hype investors forget that it’s an **insurance company f**irst and foremost
      * The most obvious proof of this is in the company’s **gross margins** which jumped in the latest quarter to 37%, but for the **full year of 2020 was at a very sub-par 26%** (vs. 70%+ for a good software company)
* Given that Lemonade is trading at a revenue multiple higher than pretty much all of the best software companies, **Lemonade really needed to crush earnings in order to propel its stock further.** It did not:
   * While customers have increased year over year by 56%, if you take a [closer look at the quarter by quarter data,](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet027.jpg) Lemonade added \~60K new customers, which is the smallest increase in the past 2 years
      * And [it’s not like the company is spending any less in marketing](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet021.jpg), which is pretty much in line with previous quarters
      * The reduction in customer growth is something I would really worry about as a Lemonade investor because that is what is the true driver of the company’s growth
   * In addition, to all of this, about **a quarter of Lemonade’s customers are in Texas,** which as you probably know was recently hit with a huge power outage
      * In the latest earnings call, management stated that there will be a spike in its gross loss ratio but no material affects to its financials, which I personally find a little hard to believe
   * Some may also point to the company’s [improvement in its operating expense margin](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet034.jpg) when compared to its gross earned premium and it’s true that it’s gone from negative 156% to negative 89% (lol)
      * But the $44.5 million spent in Q4 2020 earned the company a total of just $7.5 million in gross profit (pretty terrible unit economics)
      * Personally, I’m okay with companies during their growth stages spending tons of cash and being unprofitable, but given Lemonade’s slowing customer growth and poor gross and operating margins, Lemonade’s insanely high valuation cannot be justified
* Combined with all this, I do have to mention that the stock is also largely down the recent jump in bond yields, which punishes growth stocks, especially the ones overvalued

**What I Think Lemonade’s Stock Price Should Be**

* If we take a look at some of the [fastest growing tech stocks](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2172588b-b60a-427d-9815-f523942b2183_1145x631.png) in the world, of which all are growing quickly and have gross margins in the 70s or above, then I think it’s safe to say that at maximum, Lemonade deserves to be trading at a 35x next twelve months (i.e. 2021) sales which I think is still generous
   * **If we assume a 35x 2021 sales multiple,** then given LMND’s guidance of 2021 revenue to $115.5mm (midpoint of $114-$117mm), then we get to an enterprise value of \~$4BN
      * After we add back $1.2BN in cash, we get to an estimated market cap of $5.3BN which when you divide by Lemonade’s fully diluted shares comes out to a **$82.68 share price which represents a \~13% drop** (LMND currently trades at $93 at time of post)
   * But, I think 35x is a really generous multiple given that the company’s growth is in question and has poor margins and believe **the company should be truly trading closer to 20x,** which gives us a share price of **$55.57**
* Now do I think the stock will go down to $55? I think if bond yields continue to push higher and we have a big tech correction, I definitely think it’s possible but probably not likely given how irrational the market has been these past few years
   * Also, any reversal in bond yields will likely push the stock up but I believe over time, the stock will fall to a more reasonable level into the \~70s and so I personally do not recommend buying the dip

**TLDR:** LMND is growing impressively but has terrible unit economics and valuation is far too ahead of itself (even with the recent dip).",stocks,Lemonade Due Diligence Post - DON'T Buy the Dip,75.0,0.88

Dr_Pips_Rips_Dips,0.0,77.0,"Hey Trader Gang!

Today I bring to you an introduction to one of my favorite indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI). In my opinion, RSI is perhaps one of the most widely misunderstood and incorrectly applied indicators across the broader trading space. Whenever you see RSI getting talked about on CNBC, they usually say something along the lines of, ""RSI is severely overbought, so the stock must go down soon."" If that's all you know about RSI, or you don't even know wtf RSI is to begin with, this post is for you!

As I will explain in this post, technical analysis on RSI is much more nuanced than if the RSI is merely over 70 (standard overbought range) or under 30 (standard oversold range). RSI becomes truly powerful when it used in tandem with analysis of the price action of the asset to spot ***DIVERGENCE*** between the RSI and the price of the asset. In this post we will run through what RSI is, what divergence is and how to spot it, the various ranges on RSI, and a few other tips and tricks I've learned over the years.

So let's get into it.

**What is RSI?**

RSI stands for Relative Strength Index and is a ***momentum*** indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price movements to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions. RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., and was introduced by him in 1978.

A critical concept for new technical analysts to understand is the difference between price action trends and momentum trends. Price ***can*** ***keep going up*** as momentum drops off in strong trending markets, which results in ***divergence*** building between the price action and the momentum oscillator. Furthermore, in strong trending markets this divergence can build for a significant amount of time. So, just because momentum is dropping off does not necessarily imply that price action will immediately fall off a cliff.

**The Number Crunching for the Curious**

While not necessary for this post, a general explanation of how RSI is calculated is useful in understanding the indicator.

RSI is derived through a two step calculation:

Step 1:

*RSI* step one = 100 − \[100 / 1 + average gain/average loss\]

The average gain or loss utilized for this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during the selected ***look-back period*** (I will touch on the relevance of this look back period more when we get to covering divergences on RSI). For the math guys and gals out there it should also be noted that the formula uses a positive value for the average loss.

The standard setting for the RSI ***look-back period*** is 14. Accordingly, on a 1 Day time frame chart, the RSI is looking at the prior 14 days of price action to determine the average gain/average loss values. I will speak more about the ***look-back period*** later and its relevance to spotting divergences in price action.

Step 2:

Once the data for the 14 periods is derived, step two of the calculation may take place:

*RSI* step two = 100− \[100/ 1 + ((Previous Average Gain × 13) + Current Gain/ (Previous Average Loss × 13) + Current Loss)\]

Using the two-step formula approach above results in the current RSI number, lying somewhere between 100 and 0. Using this formula, RSI will only near 100 or 0 in **extremely strong trending markets**. This is because an integral component of the RSI formula is comparing the current gain to the previous average gains and losses, so for RSI to get close to 100 or 0 the asset really needs to be moving like a breakaway train.

**RSI LOOK-BACK PERIOD AND EMA**

As previously mentioned, the standard RSI look-back period is 14. This means that the RSI calculation is taking into account the prior 14 periods, and therefore divergences on price action outside of this 14 period look-back loose a significant amount of relevance. Personally, I set my look-back period for RSI at 21 because it allows for a larger data set to be analyzed when looking for divergences.

In addition, I run an ema on my RSI as I find it useful for analysis of the indicator (14 period RSI/22 or 21 ema and 21 period RSI/9 ema).

**What is Divergence**

To really get into discussing RSI we also need to cover Divergence. This is a quick crash course on various types of divergence, although I could dedicate an entire post to merely this topic alone. Divergence occurs when momentum oscillators are not lining up with the price action, thereby indicating a potential incoming change in the price of the asset. Spotting divergences can take quite a bit of practice, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't immediately click. Nobody said this stuff was easy!

Below is a little cheat sheet on divergences in relation to price action (the blue lines represent price action and the red lines represent a momentum oscillator such as RSI): [https://imgur.com/gallery/EfcNF28](https://imgur.com/gallery/EfcNF28)

The simplified rationale for what these divergences mean is as follows:

**Regular Bearish Divergence**: price is setting a higher high while the oscillator is setting a lower high.

* This divergence signifies that there is less momentum accompanying the higher high in price, therefore signaling that participation by the bulls is dwindling at these higher price levels.
* Here is an example of regular bearish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 day chart: [https://imgur.com/user/DrPipsRipsDips/posts](https://imgur.com/user/DrPipsRipsDips/posts)

**Regular Bullish Divergence:** price is setting a lower low while the oscillator is setting a higher low.

* This divergence signifies that there is less momentum accompanying the lower low in price, therefore signaling that participation by the bears is dwindling at these lower price levels.
* Here is an example of regular bullish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 day chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/FtCFWIr](https://imgur.com/gallery/FtCFWIr)

**Hidden Bearish Divergence**: price is setting a lower low ***in a downtrend***while the oscillators is setting a higher high.

* This divergence signifies that there is more momentum/buy pressure being put into the asset and despite that there is a resulting lower low in price.
   * In essence this shows that the bulls are pumping in increased momentum into the asset and that still cannot prevent a lower low from taking place.
   * Hidden divergences can be quite tricky to spot for the new trader and my general rule of thumb is play hidden bear div in bear markets, not bull markets.
* Here is an example of hidden bearish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 Day chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/OYTz3x0](https://imgur.com/gallery/OYTz3x0)

**Hidden Bullish Divergence**: price is setting a higher low ***in an uptrend*** while the oscillator is setting a lower low.

* This divergence signifies that there is less momentum/buy pressure being put into the asset and despite that drop in buy pressure there is a higher low in price.
   * In essence this shows that the bears are selling more and the bulls are buying less and yet this still cannot prevent a higher low (bears would want a lower low) from taking place.
   * Hidden divergence can be quite tricky to spot for the new trader and my general rule of thumb is play hidden bull div in bull markets, not bear markets.
* Here is an example of hidden bullish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 Day chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/dFaCxuw](https://imgur.com/gallery/dFaCxuw)

**Elevated Divergence:**

* Elevated Divergence is driving at the same concepts explained in Regular Bull/Bear divergence, except instead of a higher or lower price, the oscillator is much higher or lower while price **is the same**. This also indicates a significant shift of momentum on the asset in relation to price.

A ***critical element*** of the RSI formula to keep in mind is that the RSI values are calculated off of the ***closing price*** of the candle. Accordingly, candle wicks ***should not*** be used to try and spot divergence. For spotting divergences on RSI the correct methodology should be that on green candles the top of the candle body is used and on red candles the bottom of the candle body is used.

Another ***critical element*** on divergence is that divergence will often ""build"", especially if using a lower term time frame such as the 1 day, 4 hour, 1 hour, etc. On lower and medium term time frames it is often prudent to wait and see three ""strikes"" of divergence before looking to make a trade based upon the RSI divergence.

See the multiple strikes of divergence present on the 4h for QQQ: [https://imgur.com/gallery/BdgEhpB](https://imgur.com/gallery/BdgEhpB)

**Major RSI Zones &amp; Overbought/Oversold Levels**

The zone that the RSI currently finds itself within can give a strong indication of whether bulls or bears are in control. It should be noted that these zones gain more relevance on higher time frames regarding who is in control of the larger trend. In addition, how price action reacts off of the borders of these zones can be very useful for technical analysis. For example, if price is trying to break over a critical horizontal resistance level, but RSI is rejected from getting into the bull control zone (over 65), it may very well be an early indication that the breakout is going to fail, or at least stall for a bit.

**ZONES**

The Zones are as follows:

1. 65+ = bull control zone (bulls are regarded as being in control with RSI above this level)
2. 64-46 = neutral zone (this area is regarded as neutral, and may be dipped into on a bullish/bearish ""reset' of the oscillators)
3. 45- = bear control zone (bears are regarded as being in control with RSI below this level)

Below are some examples of RSI zones in action:

1. Rejection of getting into bull control zone: [https://imgur.com/gallery/f46SCR5](https://imgur.com/gallery/f46SCR5)
2. Finding support along edge of bear control zone: [https://imgur.com/gallery/YF4eIYD](https://imgur.com/gallery/YF4eIYD)

**OVERBOUGHT/OVERSOLD**

Due to the reasons explained in this post, blindly selling or buying an asset merely because it is overbought or oversold will often result in less than ideal results. However, whether an asset is ""overbought/oversold"" is still an important factor to consider and ***I have noticed*** that on very high time frames (1 week, 1 month) an asset will not remain overbought or oversold for a very long period of time. That being said, in strong bull markets RSI can spend more time over 80 than you'd think and the same applies for strong bear markets and under 30/20. Conversely, in a strong bull market RSI on higher term time frames will often bounce extremely quickly from under 30 reflecting the strong macro trend (vice versa for over 70 in bear markets).

Below are the criteria for overbought and oversold:

1. Overbought = over 70 (over 80 in strong bull markets)
   1. Here is a chart of overbought RSI on the 1 week on S&amp;P 500 futures: [https://imgur.com/gallery/BDE4iWF](https://imgur.com/gallery/BDE4iWF)
2. Oversold = below 30 (below 20 in strong bear markets, if anyone still remembers what one of those is :D)
   1. Here is a chart of oversold RSI on the 1 week on S&amp;P 500 Futures: [https://imgur.com/gallery/2h7RIW4](https://imgur.com/gallery/2h7RIW4)

That covers this crash course in RSI. Now the next time you hear a suit on TV or a Youtuber talking about overbought/oversold RSI and that as a result the asset must reverse course soon, you can proudly assure yourself that the person doesn't know as much as about RSI as you do!",stocks,Technical Analysis Series (4): Relative Strength Index (RSI),77.0,0.94
BoxesAndLights,0.0,74.0,"I’ve seen a lot of people post about being wary of MSOS and YOLO because a certain percentage of their holdings are in a liquidity trust. This is confusing and I wanted to set the record straight on why this is.

A little background for those who are unfamiliar, MSOS is the only actively managed cannabis fund with only US exposure. YOLO is essentially the same but includes Canadian exposure and a bit of UK. Dan Ahrens, manager of both of these funds, was a guest on “The Cannabis Investing Podcast” and spoke to this holding. I typed out what he said below. Keep in mind this was recorded in August 2019 so some of the details with companies may be a little dated, but the main concept and investment strategy is still 100% relevant. There is a TL;DR below if you’d prefer.

“Our fund, YOLO, is really the only fund out there so far that is getting exposure to some of these MSOs (multi-state operators). A great example is Curaleaf with the acquisition that was just announced is going to be the largest cannabis company in the world by sales. We have companies operating in the US but they’re listed on the Canadian stock exchange and can’t get listed on the Toronto yet or NASDAQ or NYSE because of these very complicated murkey federal laws. In our fund, you know it’s very prominent in our principle investment strategies that we aren’t only going to invest directly in stocks that are listed as federally legal and listed on certain exchanges. We’re also going to use derivatives, futures, options, swaps, to gain exposure to stocks with similar characteristics. So we have a third party that buys the stocks, gives us back the return of those in a total return swap. Because it’s very important that we have exposure to companies like Curaleaf, and Harvest Health, and Green Thumb Industries. Very sizeable companies operating in the US, because the US market, as you said, it’s not just bigger than Canada. It’s many, many, many times bigger than Canada. Everyone got excited about Canada because that’s where the public stocks that we could invest are, and they passed recreational use, but we have to remember it’s a tiny market compared to the United States and the worldwide market.”

When asked about these swaps appearing as trusts and funds in the holdings:

“that’s the amount of cash to cover the swap. So we are getting into the weeds here a little bit, **but I want to point out that what we’re doing is virtually the same as if you owned the stock. We aren’t going to lever it up or have leverage. That’s the amount of cash that’s being held and is always going to be equal to the amount that we own in a stock swap.**”

**TL;DR**: the trust privately invests in certain companies that cannot legally be listed on an exchange yet, and YOLO and MSOS hold the trust. It all balances out in the end.

Side note, at the time of this recording MSOS wasn’t in existence yet, so you can now get purely US exposure with that one. I’ve held these two for some time now, and I was admittedly getting a bit of FOMO when they underperformed some of the other weed ETFs this week, but I still think these have more upside potential as they are investing in US companies that are currently difficult to invest in. Once they get the greenlight to be on a common exchange, I think we will see a similar surge with YOLO and MSOS that we saw this week with the global weed ETFs. In fact, some of the companies mentioned above ARE listed now, and they’ve been soaring with the rest of them.",stocks,MSOS – Regarding having a chunk of its holdings in a liquidity trust,74.0,0.92

I would say having read a number of materials, things like [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com), even books that proprietary trading firms advocate like Jane Street, various websites, people on youtube, even the CMT coursebooks; the one commonality is that no one starts from a first-principles, axiomatic approach.

We all have some instinct that elements of technical analysis are valid. I can prove this because we all reference one TA tool or another to gauge sentiment or the strength of prevailing trends. A big one that comes to mind is CNN's Fear and Greed Index. Well, what actually is it? It looks at moving averages of the SPY and VIX to gauge sentiment. My own firm, one of the largest research and i-bank companies that has done some of the biggest recent IPOs in recent years, does a weekly positioning report that does this moving average and relative strength breakdown on a sector-by-sector basis: the very same RSI indicator you can throw on any stock or index on your own.

I start from the premise that **1.** emotions influence trading and investing decisions. **2.** price cannot move up until sell orders have been absorbed. If you can agree with me here, let's proceed.

Now, let's apply this to a concept that everyone has heard of and maybe uses but may not fully understand and from there we'll take a tour through the next extensions of it.

*Why are* ***moving averages*** *significant?*

How do you feel when you are 50% up on a stock vs. 50% down on a stock? Here it is: they serve as proxies or composite for the **cost basis** of the most recent participants in the stock and give insight into their fragility or strength. We draw that strength or weakness from the other holders. Are people chilling at their entry or is their pain tolerance being tested? If the major moving averages (often the 8, 20, 50, 100, 200, but most critically the 20, 50, and 200) are close together, all that is saying the newest and intermediate entrants' are close together.

You can take any stock (with long enough price history) and characterize the trend or lack of it by the relations of the moving averages to each other and current price: uptrend (longer-term MAs are trailing the other ones on the way up), obvious downtrend (same thing, but to the downside), or accumulation/consolidation (range-bound. getting close together), or chop (after a volatile move that throws everything off).

Each configuration of MAs paints a different picture of a stock. Say the 20 and 50 are close and you think is poised to run up: but what if the 200 MA is above your entrypoint? That tells you there are still many bagholders waiting to unload on you as soon as they've gone back to breakeven.

Compare that situation to when the 200MA is right down with the 20 and 50: this is meaningfully different because enough time has passed for most of the weaker holders to cry uncle and bow out.

**So in that sense, a bagholder down 50% who has demonstrated unwillingness to sell over many months enduring multiple legs down (aka diamond-handing), is actually identical to a long who got in at the absolute bottom, when the float has been cornered and rally is preparing, in that they are both locking down supply.**

What about when the rally occurs? Now when that bagholder sees price hits his entrypoint after a year of seeing paper losses of 50%, what is he going to do? Many of them will sell. You see this rage and anguish everywhere, people eviscerating the stock and praying to get out at breakeven. You've ever experienced this yourself or, if you're brand new to the market, you will soon.

This is turn influences the long who anticipates this and will at least begin scaling out at that first price target. Again, just look at common threads showing up over and over again. How many times have you seen ""I took some shares off the table, now I'm just letting it ride and playing with house money?"" Again making the point that these common psychological and emotional things affect all of us and these get expressed in relation to key prices.

So if you accept that bagholders are likely to sell at a sniff of being breakeven again, we can segment the price the stock has traded at into levels. **Hence we naturally arrive at the concepts of support and resistance.**

*Do you believe in mean reversion theory?* Well,  guess what **Bollinger Bands** are premised on. A stock is less likely to sustain a full standard deviation move on nothing. And this is where I want to interject my own personal opinion: these indicators and tools mean nothing without at least paying attention to the big picture. You **contextualize the drop or rise against the catalyst or fundamental change that sparked the move**. Blindly buying on ""Oh Bollinger Band was breached"" or ""RSI is oversold"" is a recipe for disaster. There is no such thing as ""Yeah I just look at the charts, that tells me the news"".

If we can learn anything from GME, Volkswagen, Sears, JC Penny, **it proves that stocks (the units themselves) are a commodity subject to the law of supply and demand.** So much of TA can be summarized as attempting to characterize the ownership of the float (again stemming from the axiom that price literally cannot move up until the sellers have at least temporarily been absorbed).

The times where TA will fly out of the window is most often when **float turnover is extremely high (during or several days after some 10x volume day or just extreme moves) and you have no idea how idea where people stand on the stock.** Again, we can relate this to the strength of the longs: the longs that were positioned beforehand have sold and we no longer have clarity into the collective longs' cost basis.  Why? Because this is a completely new batch of longs and weakness has been introduced because people have bought at the top and now the process starts over again. In this confusion the stock gaps up 15% one day, then gaps down 15% the next, then gaps up 20%, like ATOS now for one example of many. All we know is that extreme volatility is here, but we don't need to look at any indicator to tell us that.

And I believe technical analysis is **not great for penny stocks.** Not because they lack analytical power or that you can't pinpoint entrypoints, but because they cannot predict the random targeting or so-called bear raids by either proprietary trading firms, hedge funds or private syndicates. All they need to do is determine the company is not a buyout candidate, is not close to securing major contracts or going to market with their developing product, that's literally all they need to decide to short the stock. And they'll do it even if it's a decorated group of C-level execs with contacts that you would think makes it risky because of the potential for some partnership or contract, because they just want to ride it down for a couple weeks or months. Even if institutions hold 20% of the float and people take reassurance in this, 20% of say 300M or even 500M is nothing. And when you look at the average daily volume on some for these thinner stocks, even one individual trader or group of them can have enough capital to mess with the stock if he wants to and paint the entire day, much less just the close. I also do not like to apply TA to **SPACs** when they are just out of the gate as they are vulnerable to short reports by hedge funds like Citron, Point72, Hindenberg, who want to hit the stock before institutional holders have taken positions. We also have little price history to work with.

Some of my personal advice: **you should never rely on an indicator blindly, and you should always understand how they are formulated.** A MACD cross below and above the zero-line are two completely different things. A lot of them are formulated off of the open, day, and close, of a particular day, and some like Accumulation/Distribution may give a false impression because they don't account for gap downs or gap ups. So you have to take the time to understand the tools you are using. I personally stopped using volume indicators because we do not have dark pool information and I just never got in touch with someone who could explain it to me.

**Get a big picture of what's going on beyond the TA.** I'm choosing to end on this opinion because it's important to me. Don't play a penny stock and hold it after it jumps 100% overnight expecting it to continue running, and then get diluted on because you didn't realize they only had cash on hand for three more quarters, is -a billion EPS, and they have an open shelf registration, or you held a stock into the strike price of warrants, that you didn't know about because you didn't spend 1 minute glancing at finviz (current ratio will you give a quick idea they likely the company is to do a secondary offering; just using common sense, they're not going to wait till the very last day before issuing shares for more cash, right?) or the shareholder's equity section of the balance sheet (to know if warrants will be at play).

This happened specifically multiple times to me before I got tired of seeing 100% overnighters dump down to 20% gain before I finally decided ""You know what, I'm going to spend literally 1 minute to save myself thousand of dollars."" Another way of saying this is to ""**Have a plan**"", and be educated enough to have one.

Those are two concrete examples of things that take 1 minute to look up, that I didn't do and lost thousands in paper gains because of it. I still have those trade confirmations saved (OPTT, TRXC, a couple more), and will never delete them because of how painful, at a time where as a new college grad making not a lot it would have meaningfully changed my life. And so they can serve me as reminders  that there is no such thing as a free lunch: anytime you try and be lazy, the market will expose and punish you. Actually **write down** your entry and exit conditions. None of any of this matters is if you don't do that. It does not matter if you get 80% of all your trades right if that 5th trade undoes everything you did right.",stocks,A Discussion of the Intuition behind Technical Analysis,75.0,0.92
electricp0ww0w,0.0,78.0,"Ok guys, bear with me. Aplogies in advance if I get anything wrong. I just wanna have discussion on Roblox, where it's going, what happens and why the market could goof us retail guys again. I'm no expert. Im not financial pro. I just sit at home all day reading about stocks and learning new stuff.

Quick backstory, Roblox is dropping onto the market on March 10th via DPO. A DPO is a direct public offering. It's similar to an IPO, but in simple terms, it slams onto the market, for everyone at the same time.

Remember the debacle with AirBNB and DoorDash? They were IPO's, scooped up by the hedgies and big boys. When retail wanted to buy, the price was stupid high and a lot of people got the rug pulled out from them. My understanding is the prices have settled now, but that day was a huge shitshow with retail buying power seriously hindered by the volume, demand, prices and platforms of retail brokers. 

Roblox will be ten times worse.

I'll make this next bit quick. (Edit - I lied, this next bit isn't quick but it is necessary). - 

**What is Roblox?**

Roblox is a MONEY PRINTER. Seriously. Maybe you're not into games, or have no kids or whatever. Basically, think of it as something like minecraft. Its a computer game for kids. The characters are made up of blocks, and run around online, meeting other players, doing little games, meeting each other, performing tasks etc. I don't really know, i've never played it but watched some YT vids of people playing. In simple terms, it's good honest child friendly fun, which even adults can have a laugh with. 

It runs on Console, PC and mobile. Roblox has 1600 employees dedicated to removing hate speech and offensive things. There was a link to some far right groups using Roblox. As soon as they were found out by the press, Roblox banned them outright. My understanding is that as far as online gaming goes, it's very safe and good for kids, without much toxic language or offensive things that can upset young kids. It seems Roblox take their shit seriously in respect of this. 

~ Let's quickly talk numbers ~

First off, let's drop the Tsar Bomba (aka the biggest mofo nuclear bomb ever made) of figures;

From wiki - *From February 2020 to January 2021, Roblox experienced an increase in valuation from $4 billion to $29.5 billion, an increase attributed largely to the pandemic.*

**29 MOTHERFUDGING BILLION IN 11 MONTHS.**

Read that last line again before we continue. 

Next up, lets talk players. Again, wiki;

**As of August 2020, Roblox has over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all children aged under 16 in the United States**

164 MILLION.  Let me put that into perspective. I want you to imagine every single person in Argentina, Ghana, Saudia Arabia, Cuba, Sweden, Israel, Hong Kong, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Switzerland. That's how many people are active on RBLX each month. Mental. Now, obviously I could have just said 50% of the USA but that's boring.

Now don't get me wrong, its not up to the heights of things like PUBG, Fortnite or Runescape, but it's 30% more popular than World of Warcraft and 50% more popular than GTA. 
Oh, and RBLX is *free to play*. However, it generates its money from ""Robux"". Basically, you can pay for these Robux as a form of currency, which you can then spend on special abilities in game. If I had $1 every time I read on Reddit, as user saying ""all my kid asks for at Christmas and birthdays is these damn Robux coin things"", then i'd have enough $$$ to take on SpaceX. It seems like kids just lap this shit up all the time, and parents seem fairly happy to pay for it because it's a fun game with no toxic assholes. It certainly has less of the agressive, competitive stigma and negative traits that has been attached to games like Fortnite. 

Anyway, go and do you own DD on this. I'm sure there are some negatives to be found, so go take a look.  All you really need to know is that RBLX is a motherfakin JUGGERNAUGHT of online gaming. In 2020 it had a revenue of *$2.2 billion* across all platforms. 

**""Hey Electricpowow what is the point of all this crap about robollocks or something?**

Ok listen up and lets get to the point; this is my own sheer prediciton and that's it.... But, RBLX is going to be the MOTHER of all meme stonks. Seriously. It's a silly game with huge values and various other subreddits will find it hilarious to send Roblox to the moon. Mainly because of how simple it is. It's just got the whole aire of a meme stock about it. Even those that want to make it a meme stock believe deep down that it actually is a solid money maker at heart. The fact it's a silly kids video game makes it even sweeter. We know what the retail power is when it comes to video game related stock matters....

Secondly, ignoring people who post rocket emojis and apes, this kinda stuff is gonna be loved by boomers. What do boomers have? Kids. What do kids talk about all day long? Roblox. These are the same boomers who invest in Apple because their 14 year old never shuts up about how amazing the next iPhone will be. They'll be doing the same with their small kids on the Blox. I've even seen some redditors saying they'll be buying Roblox as a long term investement then gift it to their kids in 14 years time for their 18th, like it's some sort of damned Roblox based trust fund or some crazy shit. Can you imagine Cramer trying to explain League of Legends to his boomer audience? Well he doesn't need to explain Roblox because the boomer's kids talk about it all day. 

Now, the whole point of this is that.... EVERYONE is gonna want a slice of the Roblox pie. Even more so, that its coming out as an DPO. That means you and Papa Musk and horrible nasty Uncle Melvin will be able to buy RBLX at the same time. My understanding is they usually list at about midday. 

Now, why is Blox going to be a DPO and not an IPO? **They actually wanted to list as an IPO several months ago**. Wait, sorry that's not right. They wanted to list as an IPO **TWICE** and pulled out. Why? Well, one reason is that their accounting needed a closer examination, but the primary reason was because they saw the utter shitshow that was AirBNB. They saw AirBNB moon all the way past Jupiter and in no time at all, it nailed back down to earth with more power then a Michael Jordan slam dunk. 

In short, Roblox guys realised that IPO's are quite unstable with big companies, so they do DPO. I also think that a DPO somehow lets current investors safely leave their positions without getting burned or something, but im unsure on this. 

It also means that the DPO price will be much higher than an IPO starting price. This in turn brings some stability. My understanding is the expected IPO price was going to be about $5 per share, whereas the DPO price will be around $45/s. 45 Dollars a share is still pretty damn cheap. 

Now, consider that Andreessen Horowitz are one of their big investors. Ok, so who the hell is Andrew Hogwartz? That shit don't matter, all you need to know is that their track record of investment in young companies is as follows -

Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Lyft, Occulus VR, GitHub, BuzzFeed and loads of others. Oh and they also dumped 800 million into Crypto in the last 5 years. What's the theme here? Tech based software stocks that balloon in value. That's what. I think its fair to say, that when it comes to tech and software, Andreas Hobofizz knows exactly what they are doing. And they've dumped their money and reputation into the Blox. 

Now, with all this said what does this mean? It means everyone will want a slice of the RBLX cake. Boomers who's kids never shut up about it. People who like tech stocks. Gamers. Meme train riders. Investement funds and big hedgies. Everyone can see that RBLX is a money machine. And in fairness, $45/s is modest when you dive deep into the numbers. 

TakeTwo interactive (Grand Theft Auto) is $186/s. Activision is at $95/s. Tencent (who do Leage of Legends, another HUGE multiplayer online game) is at $88/s. Electronic arts, $137/s. 

Yadadayablah you get the idea. The only real big name I can find which is near the RBLX price is Nintendo at $78/s. (This is for another day but I think Nintendo is massively undervalued - Maybe thats why Cathy and her ARKK have been constantly buying it of late?)

So, what is my whole point of this? If you got this far, good work, because i'm a moron and my hands hurt from all this typing but I like you guys so ima carry on...

Thing is, on March 10th. Every man and his dog is gonna want to throw some money at the Blox. And what happens when everyone wants to buy? Our shitty retail brokers... break. They have 'outages', they are slow, they don't process orders quickly etc etc. Maybe this is because of the huge volume and demand. Tin foil hat wearers will say it's all orcestrated, to freeze out retail while the hedgies get into the Blox at 45/s and we can't get in until 90/s, just like what happened with AirBNB and DoorDash. 

Note this, in all the reading i've done so far about RBLX, I've not seen a single article that is offering negative sentiment about it. I saw a fair amount of negative sentiment about the other two in the buildup, but especially DoorDash. 

So, obviously you can set your limits, but this won't work if the price is zooming around and the volume is being gobbled up. Oh yeah, volume. 199 million shares will be up for grabs. 

AirBNB put out 50 million. I think DD put out about 35 million. So... RBLX is putting out a lot of shares... But I also think it's gonna have much more interest than the companies I just mentioned...

I don't know what the answer or solution is here if you do wanna buy it. I personally think (in the short term), it'll be bigger than a certain recent StopGame share in terms of interest. I honestly believe everyone will want some of this, and as retail investors, we're likely gonna get boned. *again*. 

Now this also extends to people who might not care about RBLX. If you shitty broker goes down, or lags, or won't connect because everyone wants some blox, then good luck selling that pennystock you've been sat on for a while when March 10th is the perfect time to sell. It *might* have a knock on effect on your ability to perform other trades so please bear it in mind. You spot an amazing buy on American Airlines but unlucky bro, you cant because your shitty phone based broker has another 'outage' because everyone wants to buy rublix or some shit. Maybe people could set up a couple of brokers to give them the best chance of a buy? Remember some brokers want proof of earnings and stuff so consider this sooner rather than later if you want in on this partay. 

Finally; Ever seen or heard someone online say *""oof""*? Its a Roblox meme that's been around for years. Its the noise a character makes when it gets hurt or falls over. Its another meme version of 'RIP'.  I hope March 10th isnt a big **oof** for retail.

And that's it guys and girls. I'd love to hear thoughts on this. At least give me the dignity of telling me my DD and entire post sucks. This will justify the 25 minutes I spent typing this out. 

My position? I'm unsure at the moment. I'm 50/50 between going total YOLO on Roblox on the 10th and either sitting out totally, or just trying to open a small position to see if I'm right.",stocks,Prediction- March 10th will be another shitshow in the market.

0toHeroInvesting,0.0,74.0,"**The stock market finished another great week at record highs. Investors turn even more bullish with semiconductors &amp; pot skyrocketing. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish at all time highs with the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/9QkK5ca) gaining 1% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/o3g9vaq) rose by 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/TMdS1Ly) outperformed rising 1.7%, as 8 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/VejvtiI) finished the week with gains, with Utilities and Consumer Discretionary losing over 1%, but it’s important to note that the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/qFVLzd6) also closed at the lowest level in almost a year, as it closed under 20 on Friday.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/cvTchF7) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows pretty mixed results, with semiconductors &amp; financials popping while the rest of the stock market had mixed results.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as the TD Ameritrade January [Index](https://imgur.com/V78bPVC) came in at 6.91, up over 10% over December as most retail investors bought Apple, AMD &amp; AT&amp;T. The other interesting number that we received was the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/Pi3tk6d), which showed what I was expecting, as it came in with a more bullish view of the retail investors as I predicted last week, which is one thing to look at as a contrarian indicator, so right now, I’m not really adding anything to my portfolio, but I am still gathering some cash for the next correction/pullback.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw Job [Openings](https://imgur.com/URoCI4p) in December coming in slightly better than expectations as the job opening rate stood at 4.5% while the jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/Ouf4H1d) came in down almost 20k vs last week but was higher than expected by analyst as the number of continuing jobless claim grew by over 50K.

This [week](https://imgur.com/1foTccl) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with only jobless claims and some preliminary numbers of the PMIs while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/rySV2ud) front, we do have a couple of interesting ones left with names like Shopify, Fastly, Roku, Walmart, Fiverr &amp; many others reporting.

In some other stock market news, we saw pot stocks torching the market towards new highs in the beginning of the week, only to [crumble](https://imgur.com/TNZOw4X) on Thursday, but still, most of the stocks managed to finish the week with very big gains. We can see that the [ETF](https://imgur.com/XgntUvu) for these stocks has crushed the markets and has almost doubled already this year. This hole spike started after Tilray announced an agreement with Grow Pharma for a [deal](https://imgur.com/TuznO0z) in the UK and of [course](https://imgur.com/21Lt9F2) the “chatter” on Reddit’s biggest stock market forum. And by the way, it’s still interesting to watch the Aphria/Tilray merger developments, to see if either Aphria spikes again, or if Tilray goes down to counteract the current 30% discount on the merger.

Meanwhile, despite popping on Monday after a [new](https://imgur.com/xwv5lEU) partnership with IBM which will be available starting in March, Palantir finished the week more than 5%, ahead of the Q4 earnings results that will be announced this morning, and should be interesting to watch if they sustain the huge rise of the stock in the past months. (Later edit: PLTR beat on revenue but posted an unexpected loss of $0.06/share)

We also saw numbers from Tesla’s China [sales](https://imgur.com/fc8gduC), which more than doubled in 2020 and now stand at 21% of their total sales at almost $7B, as the model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China in 2020. Tesla also slumped last [week](https://imgur.com/KNzzLHK), despite popping on Monday after the disclosure of $1.5B in digital currency assets bought in January, as more [analysts](https://imgur.com/eMxGtXU) are pointing to a potential battery cell supply shortage in the future for EV companies.

Regarding earnings reports, there were a couple of interesting one’s last week, with Disney [posting](https://imgur.com/4x7GFjt) a surprise profit of $0.32 and beating on revenues, as Disney+ subscribers are nearing the 100M mark, while the current total direct-to-consumer subs stand at 146M. This helped the company return to profitability after just one quarter of negative [results](https://imgur.com/kvEjJN3), which is incredible given the big hit taken by the rest of their revenue streams.

Apple also had an interesting week after [reports](https://imgur.com/wHUEKv9) that they are not in talks with Hyundai, Kia on developing a self-driving electric car, while JP Morgan [speculated](https://imgur.com/UX2MvzG) they might partner with Renault, and pointed to a couple of interesting things, like Renault’s 1million units of excess capacity, their track record with contract manufacturing and the flexibility this might give Apple to having a bigger input on the manufacturing process. It’s also to be noted that this could be a nice synergy for them, as Renault &amp; Nissan have struggled with their EV products, so this could provide a big presence across key regions for both of the companies, while also offering premium products, as Apple pretty much stands for premium offerings. Though, it’s still very [unclear](https://imgur.com/IYjOfBX) which way Apple will go, but it’s pretty safe to say, they are definetly moving forward with this project.

Also, regarding earnings reports we did have a couple of interesting ones, as the recent green energy favorite, [Enphase](https://imgur.com/tvpnxk0) beat expectations by $0.11, as the stock popped on better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.

We also saw [Twitter](https://imgur.com/KQb4ClB) beating expectations for the quarter on the top and bottom line, but disappointed on monetizable daily users which came in 1.5M lower than expected, though this didn’t stop the stock to pop to new highs at over $70.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://imgur.com/Yk0tdaK) also posted great beats on the earnings report as the company showcased an EBIT 20% beat than expected, but this didn’t help the stock as it sold off after the report that it may also be high be the global chip shortage, as this has made big companies like [NVIDIA](https://imgur.com/oVFjne0) to bring back older products to meet the insane demand for semiconductors.

One last piece of news for the week was that Qualcomm unveiled their [new](https://imgur.com/vrKYXlS) 5G modem to compete in this new 5G rush, while also [objecting](https://imgur.com/9epoJGz) to NVIDIA possible ARM acquisition, as this could possibly limit other chipmakers accessing the intellectual property possessed by ARM, as this is used in 95% of the world’s smartphones.

So, let’s hope for a good week in the stock markets again, as we have to keep an eye on what big companies like Walmart &amp; Shopify announce later in the week.

I had a lot of traction with my previous post on $ARKK so I thought I would lay out a very simple case as to why, in my view and others, we may experience more inflation in the coming years than the US has experienced in the last 50 years, and the potential implications of such a scenario.

**********************

The math is simple and it relies on two basic concepts from Macroeconomics 101:

1. M2 Money Supply - this is an estimate published by the Federal Reserve that approximates dollars in circulation (and things like savings accounts, money market funds, and other sources that are liquid and can behave like cash)

2. M2 Velocity of Money - Also published by the Fed, this seeks to estimate the number of times that each dollar in M2 exchanges hands over the course of the year (turnover)

The equation linking these two concepts to Gross Domestic Product is quite simple as well.

M2 Money Supply x M2 Velocity = Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP)

**********************

What we saw throughout 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policies that followed, was a substantial increase in money supply (stimulus) and a substantial decrease in the velocity of money (stay-at-home orders). Based on our simple equation, these factors mostly offset each other and therefore were not visibly inflationary.

1. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 money supply increased from $15.1 trillion to $19.4 trillion (+28%) Note: Fastest growth rate since WWII

2. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 velocity declined from 1.4 to 1.1 (-21%)

Plugging into our equation:

Year-end 2019: 1.4 x $15.1T = $21.14T annualized nominal GDP

Year-end 2020: 1.1 x $19.4T = $21.34T annualized nominal GDP

This represents a change in NGDP of just 1%! No inflation!

**********************

What happens next? Some of you have already gotten vaccines, others have already been sick and developed immunity. States have recently announced reopening completely, and national case counts are showing relatively steep declines as we approach vaccination and illness-induced herd immunity.

What does this mean? Consumer spending habits are changing. Record high savings rates and savings balances are likely to revert to normal. We'll take vacations, go to concerts, eat out at restaurants, etc - all things we haven't been able to do for the last 12 months.

This means a recovery in M2 velocity but with a new much higher base of money.

**********************

Let's look back at our equation and make a few assumptions about the recovery of velocity.

***Scenario 1: Velocity recovers to pre-COVID level at end of 2019***

1.4 x $19.4T = $27.16T NGDP (+27% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 2: Velocity recovers and overshoots the pre-COVID level, say to the trailing 10-year average velocity of 1.5***

1.5 x $19.4T =$29.1T NGDP (+36% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 3: Inflation becomes widely recognized and consumers/investors look for alternatives to holding cash, velocity spikes to the highest it has been in 10 years at 1.75 and inflation feeds on itself***

1.75 x $19.4T = $33.95T NGDP (+59% compared with year-end 2020)

**********************

It is likely that this inflation will be spread out over more than a year, but the key question at hand is:

*""How long will it take for the price level to reflect all of this new money in the system and how long will it take for velocity to fully recover (or overshoot)?""*

In each scenario, even if it took 2-3 years we are talking about ***double digit annualized inflation rates...*** 

*AND THAT IS BEFORE WE SEE THE IMPACT ON MONEY SUPPLY AND VELOCITY FROM YET MORE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS.*

Inflation rates may be *much higher* than the figures outlined above... and despite all of this the Federal Reserve continues to say that they see no inflation, that they are content to keep short-term interest rates at zero until 2023 or later. Asleep at the wheel if you ask me.

**********************

What does it mean for r/stocks and your investment portfolio? In a nutshell:

1. Nominal interest rates are likely to rise, commodity prices (oil) will increase, real estate values will increase (REITs), the prices of all *real assets* will increase.

2. Companies that are able to index their revenues to inflation (pricing power!) will be able to defend their earnings, while others will see input costs skyrocket and revenues fail to keep up.

3. The equity markets are going to be volatile, with winners and losers. Companies that are highly leveraged and don't have pricing power may go bankrupt when they need to refinance debts at higher rates.

4. Other companies with pricing power, low variable costs, or durable intellectual property will be huge winners.

5. Tech/growth stocks that trade at obscenely rich valuation and who promise real profits years or decades into the future are going to get smashed. These so called ""long-duration"" equities, many of which are favorites on r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets, even if they survive, may go from trading at 25-50x trailing revenues (on zero net income) to 5-10x revenue or less - examples: SHOP trades at 50x trailing revenues and 470x trailing earnings, ROKU trades at 27x trailing revenue on *negative earnings*. 

6. In relation to point 5, inflation-driven equity volatility is likely to result in *higher equity risk premiums*, or higher discount rates on forecasted growth. 

7. Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.

8. Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation (American middle class) will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash. There's a whole other discussion about income and wealth inequality in here but we'll leave that for another day.

&amp;nbsp;

Resonant Inc, a late-stage development company, designs and develops filters for radio frequency (RF) and front-ends used in the mobile device, automotive, medical, Internet-of-things, and related industries in the United States and internationally. It uses Infinite Synthesized Networks technology, a software platform to configure and connect resonators that are building blocks of RF filters.

&amp;nbsp;

Why is this important? Resonant ($RESN) makes products for mobile and IoT devices that connect through 5G. Their technology allows to filter out lower frequencies that can overlap with 5G frequencies, critical as the RF spectrum becomes more and more congested. This technology has the potential to be in every 5G device.

&amp;nbsp;

In the beginning of 2020, they signed a strategic investment and a licensing agreement to design 5G RF filters with their XBAR® technology, with Murata Manufacturing, THE biggest RF Filter and Duplexer manufacturer in the world. (Source: Navian, 2019)


&amp;nbsp;

In late December 2020, the company released a letter to shareholders indicating that they surpassed a shipment milestone of 50Million RF Filters, among other encouraging news. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150894/0/en/Resonant-Issues-Shareholder-Letter-and-Provides-Corporate-Update.html)

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday, February 9th 2021, they provided prelim FY2020 results, showing revenues increased 330% YoY to a Record $3.2 Million. Also reported that as of December 31, 2020, Resonant had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25.0 million, which included $11.0 million of net proceeds from sales of equity under the Company’s previously announced at-the-market (ATM) program. And as far as I can tell, no debt. [source link](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/09/2172260/0/en/Resonant-Provides-Preliminary-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results-Revenues-Increase-Over-330-to-a-Record-3-2-Million.html)

&amp;nbsp;

Here's where it becomes interesting.. Resonant has reached a milestone with Murata Manufacturing allowing them to move to the next phase of building a commercial platform &amp; high-volume manufacturing of XBAR-based RF filters for 5G.

Institutional investors have also been steadily increasing their stake: 

* AWM Investment Co., Inc.	7.70%
* Longboard Capital Advisors LLC	6.97%
* BlackRock Fund Advisors	4.77%
* Select Equity Group LP	4.66%
* Park City Capital LLC	3.69%
* The Vanguard Group, Inc.	3.18%

43.44% of the stock is currently owned by institutional investors, based on some early January numbers. Probably higher now.

&amp;nbsp;

Short % of Float (Jan. 29, 2021) 10.01%

Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jan. 29, 2021) 9.33%

It is reasonable to assume that not too many are betting against this company.

$RESN has been popping up on my twitter feed via some of the traders and investors I follow such as: [@LuoshengPeng](https://twitter.com/LuoshengPeng) and [@kkernttb](https://twitter.com/kkernttb) among others.

&amp;nbsp;

So what we see so far is that their sales are growing, they're exceeding their projections, meeting contractual agreements while working with an industry giant. The best part is, they have opted for an intellectual property licensing business model, in the manner of Qualcomm, ARM and others.

&amp;nbsp;

$RESN seems to still fly under the radar but has a good runaway to go for 2021.

&amp;nbsp;

Would love to hear your thoughts on this one! And how did I do on my first DD.

**UPDATE** SOME MORE INFO ON RF FILTERS...The proliferation of 4G LTE networks, the deployment of new 5G networks, and the pervasive nature of Wi-Fi are driving a dramatic increase in the number of RF bands that smartphones and other mobile devices must support. And with the coming of IoT, those bands will be more congested than ever! Each band must be isolated using filters to avoid interference that will drain battery life, reduce data speeds, and cause dropped calls. RF filters are nothing new, and have been a part of mobile devices since their creation with 1G phones and those old wireless handsets we had at home before the advent of cellular tech!

 &amp;nbsp;

What makes this unique is that 5G needs to be even more isolated from other bands to ensure signal reliability and strength. $RESN is at the forefront of this tech for 5G.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a post of very basic guidelines when it comes to trading and investing, and I think it's important info regardless of the current state of the market. Note - I am not a financial advisor, but these are general rules I think everyone should think about before they buy in.


* **Can I afford to invest this money?** - This is by far one of the most important things to ask yourself. If you have an extra $1000 laying around that you are 100% certain you will be okay living without, then proceed on to the next step. If you have any second thoughts or hesitations, the answer is no. Be honest with yourself here. Do you have bills and rent to pay? Are you expecting a big expense in the next few weeks or months? Do you have an emergency fund in place? Remember, once your money is invested, what happens to it is out of your hands. Whatever you decide to invest in may turn out well, or it may totally blow up in your face. Think carefully here.

* **How soon am I expecting a return?** - Are you investing for retirement in 40 years? Or are you expecting to mess around and turn a nice profit in a month? There are no right answers, only what you are hoping to achieve. Depending on your answer, there are different instruments and securities that can help you realize your timeline. However, in general, the sooner you are expecting a profit, the more risk there may be. Which moves me to my next point.

* **How much risk am I willing to tolerate?** - Saving for retirement in 40 years, and are not much of a risk taker? Great! The stock market works well for people in this category since, overall, the stock market grows positively over the course of decades (with some negative dips due to things like recessions, crashes, etc). Looking to turn a profit ASAP and consider yourself a risk-taker? Great! The stock market has something for that, too. Want a profit ASAP but not willing to take a risk? The stock market may not be for you. Consider a loan. 

* **What investments will help me reach my goal?** - So you've decided on your investment amount, your timeline, and your risk. Now the question is what the heck do you invest in? In general, those with longer timelines and lower risk can benefit from things like index funds or ETFs. Without getting too detailed, these are basically the average performance of a group of top companies within a sector. The S&amp;P 500 is an index fund of the top 500 companies in the US and is generally a safe index. ETFs are similar in that they track the average performance of multiple companies, however, they can narrow down to be sector specific. You can invest in an ETF of almost any sector, from electric vehicles to air travel to even marijuana businesses. Since they all track the average performance of multiple companies, there's less risk since one company performing negatively in that fund may be countered by positive performances of many others. If you feel strongly enough about any one single company, and want to invest in that company by itself, there's nothing wrong with doing so. But remember, this carries a bit of risk as you won't get the benefit of having losses offset by way of an index/ETF. For those of with shorter timelines and higher risk profiles, you can look to invest in more volatile stocks (meme stocks and the like) and make trades based on their day to day/week to week performance. There's definitely big returns to be made with the right play, but again, the risk is higher and you need to be prepared for that. Options are also another popular (and riskier) investment vehicle, which is essentially a bet on a stock's movement in the future. I won't go into details about that here, but you should check out r/options to learn more.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)**

**-** I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $1.702 billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.

\- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018. **The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair’s products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.** Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair’s higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty. 

\- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators. The margins are much higher in this area than in components and streamer customers seem to regard Elgato products with high enthusiasm.

\- Adjusted EBITDA tripled in 2020 to $213 million which it seems can be attributed to an explosion of demand for Corsair’s products by customers who are spending more time at home working and gaming.

I struggle to believe that with all the recent media attention on $BB that smarter money does not see the massive under-value that seems to be Blackberry.

Yes they have lots to prove, but if you look at everything they are doing, partnerships, announcements, platforms, international scope, governments and private companies... They seem to have a lot of potential in a lot of areas.   


Thematically speaking they've managed to transition their business into a highly scalable, growing industry. With the internet-of-things and everything increasingly digital, the solar winds hack and critical risk of ransom-ware on any business... it seems Blackberry is in the right place.  


I think their inclusion in the meme-stock bandwagon was justified and retail investors found an under-valued opportunity...but the hype may have got ahead of itself.   


Speaking purely from a market perspective point of view Blackberry is still described as communications equipment and this is absolutely NOT what they are about. So, can someone who knows Crowdstrike well please compare the two companies and explain the massive differing market cap valuations?

TittiesnSteins,0.0,65.0,"So I’ve got a decent option strategy that I use on QQQ and SPY that I’ve back tested and to prove consistent returns, what backtesting doesn’t show is emotion.  

The setup was placed Monday, put credit spreads on QQQ needing it to close above 305. This was based on historical and current data, stimulus news and where the charts sat, it was a good trade. 

The week goes through, we break 305, so I exit and replace the trade -$400 loss for a 300 close. Which is fine as the gains will be $800.

My dumb ass decides to sit and watch the market and not walk away for a few hours. QQQ breaks 300, 299, 298. I didn’t like it. It came back to 301 and I sold out at a -700 loss. 

Qqq finished the day at 308. 

My original plan, backtested, proved that this is successful 98% of the time. Guess what, it would have been successful and a clean $500 gain. Now I’m sat on an $1100 loss because I didn’t grip myself and trade the plan.

michanik,0.0,70.0," Since the crash of 2020, many sectors have recovered and are trading at pre-pandemic levels (looking at you Tech). Defense and Aerospace is one of the few sectors that are still trading at a massive discount. Big names such as Raytheon Technologies (RTX), General Electric (GE), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) can be grabbed at a discount.

My favorite being Lockheed Martin.

Lockheed Martin has had a phenomenal decade with revenues and profits growing about an average of 9.5% YoY. its profit and operating margins are sitting at a healthy 10 and 13% respectively. With deep ties to the US government and a steady increase in military budgets (who represent 70% of sales) as well as any hint of potential conflicts directly benefit the company.  
Its F35 program has had some issues and production delays due to covid but is looking like it is taking off. This will guarantee a further revenue stream for the next decade at least. Its missiles and fire control segment grew a whopping 51% since 2017 with its other sector such as Aeronautics and space segment at about 23% each. Furthermore, LMT is the prime contractor for NASA's Orion Spacecraft and is working actively with them on long-duration human deep space exploration.  
LMT pays a solid dividend of about 3.1% at current prices that has been increasing steadily over the years and is likely to continue.

Other options to capture the sector exist such as the DFEN ETF (though should be warned it is leverage, hence the very strong price drop) or the more general ITA ETF.

Disclaimer. I own all 3 of the stocks mentioned. Picked up GE and Raytheon in December and recently took up Lockheed. They seem like great value and have provided steady returns and are one of the few sectors left that are still trading at undervalued prices. I believe the weak sectors are bound for a rebound due to the great rate of vaccine uptake that will subsequently lead to a new economic cycle starting. Companies that have a solid business as is in this case will profit even more.

Thank you for reading.

My other top picks include Exxon and BP (Oil and Gas, though they are no longer trading at the same discount but still have some room for growth with essential business and good dividends), Wells Fargo and JP Morgan (Banks and financial services), Kelloggs (undervalued consumer staples, which will benefit from a strong economic recovery) and Simon Property Group and WP Carey (solid dividend-paying REITs which are also undervalued).",stocks,Defense and Aerospace stocks are undervalued and are a good opportunity for investment,70.0,0.9
fkuser250k,0.0,66.0," Alright guys,

I've got a solid one here and spent quite a bit of time on this. Two Words: Xeris Pharmaceuticals. They already have two recently approved and commercialized drugs(Gvoke for diabetes) that did roughly $20m in revenue in 2020 during COVID and with only six months to market since it was launched in June 2020. For example analyst estimates for Q3 was $4m, they did $9m. They beat analyst expectations every time. Really shows strength by management, but we trading at less than the low estimate for their U.S sales estimates. Peak Global for Gvoke is $500m a year, and they recently got EU approval for 27 countries. Short manipulation and OPEX manipulation fucks this one up a lot. To put it short, my first price target is $30, and others well over $50. here is why. Xeris pharmaceuticals is a platform pharmaceutical company that has two revolutionary techs: XeriJect and XeriSol. Essentially, the technology creates the revolutionary potential to address the limitations of conventional medicines with low stability and low solubility. Many medicines require water, refrigeration, larger dosing and with an inconvenient delivery method(IV, rectal, etc). The Xeri-technology solves these problems, no other company can do this shit. Its patented too.

 My favorite part of this is CEO Daddy Paul. Management in this company is top fucking notch. All were part of the same team in selling their previous company Durata for $23 bucks/share, and many many other companies. All have connections in big pharma and lead the commercialization efforts of many drugs. Paul Edick has extensive experience in big pharma companies including lead positions as President of Asia Pacific and Latin America operations at Pharmacia(Acquired by Pfizer in 2002 for $60bn) and at Searle Pharma as President for Asia Pacific, Canada, and Latin American operations. He lead the global commercialization efforts of $3bn/yr Celebrex along with John Shannon. Then in 2006, Paul became CEO of MedPointe Healthcare, which he later sold to Meda of Sweden for roughly $820m, the deal closed in 2007. In 2008, Paul was chosen to lead Ganic Pharmaceuticals, a $1bn Warburg Pincus-backed Investment Search Vehicle, as CEO to acquire specialty pharma assets. During this time Paul acquired an asset coming out of Pfizer, an antibiotic called Dalbavancin, which he quickly turned around into a fully fledged company, taking it public as Durata Therapeutics (NASDAQ:DRTX) in 2010. After several years of commercialization of development, Paul sold Durata to Actavis(now Allergen) in 2014 for roughly $675m. After some time, Paul exited retirement for the third time at the request of his previous investors to potentially lead a variety of companies. After looking through over 30+ companies, Paul chose Xeris Pharmaceuticals, which he officially joined in 2017 as CEO and Chairman. 

 

John Shannon, COO and now more recently President, served as the CEO of Catheter Connections for a couple years until it was finally sold to Merit Medical in 2016. John also served alongside Paul at Durata as CCO until its acquisition. Prior to these roles, John has a extensive history in big pharma, notably as VP at Baxter Healthcare, where he commercialized and drove sales for two drugs: GAMMAGARD and ADVATE ( $1bn/yr each).

Essentially Xeris is a BO target in the future. Also there was a recent CEO interview, Paul literally stated at like 1:40:00 something or around there that while they did do an offering at a low price, investors will be happy when Xeris will be trading at $40-$50 soon. So the link cant be posted, but search it on youtube: Tales from the Trenches: Paul Edick, CEO of Xeris.

They have a bunch of other things in the pipeline. Excluding any licensing potential from their technology, their pipeline peak global sales is **close to $2bn annually.** Underfollowed and Under fucking valued. They are focusing on selling their diabetes drug and have 3 drugs for licensing, pramlintide, Diazepen, and their current Gvoke Offering in Europe. No company was ever able to combine Insulin and pramlintide together, Xeris tech did it. CEO stated at a recent conference that FDA was highly interested in that Phase 3 program and its a ""gamechanger"" in a $5bn US market. Diazepam is for seizures and currently it must be injected anally, Xeris technology fixed that with their tech, now its the first easy to use intramuscular injection. Global market for Diazepen is smaller at only $1bn. They added two more drugs to their pipeline. Guys NOTHING in this company is currently being valued in their stock price, this should be trading between $1.5bn to $3bn already. Even their current approved drug peak sales at $500m isn't valued properly! Using an average industry comp of 2-3x peak sales == $1.5bn, that's for the approved Gvoke alone. Doesn't include pipeline or tech.

 

Oh yeah let me fucking casually say that Big pharma is interested in their tech, they have 3 active projects with BIG pharma (yeah big swinging dicks like Pfizer and Daddy JJ shit).

 

Don't buy calls, too much manipulation. Worth $30 minimum. Buy shares, make the shorts squeeze, then ride it to $30-$50. Quality Management, quality product and tech with unlimited potential. Also their cash is $140m, and they said they have enough until cash flow .",stocks,[Quality DD] Xeris Pharmaceuticals is the most ridiculously undervalued pharma stock in the market right now.,66.0,0.73

merger happened, now it’s BFLY just a regular stock. Going to go ahead and say right off I believe in the product and see huge market potential. This is a long hold for me- looking at years.

Positions: April 16 call contracts X2 20$ strike price 4.66$ (in the money now), 134 shares AVG price 16.59$. - update: averaged up my shares and sold my calls I’m up to 230 shares average price about 19$ across 2 platforms

I’m not diving deep into financials here just talking about the market and applications.

Basically they have the worlds first ultrasound probe that does not use an expensive crystal for generating ultrasound waves. This is a pretty big leap for the market in terms of cost saving which can be passed on to the medical providers. Ultrasound machines have come a long way, but until very recently were large, fairly immobile machines that cost 20-30k$ a pop. A price drop to 2-3k$ for a probe that you can plug into a smartphone and run as an ultrasound machine greatly improves access to ultrasound.

Why care? Ultrasound is increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool to avoid radiation. It is also used for dynamic testing and targeting for medical procedures (moving parts of the body to target injections into the right muscles, bursa or joint capsules. Nearly any doctor - including trainees can afford one. Again why would they buy one?

Billing- diagnostic ultrasound is a billable procedure. Procedural ultrasound is a billable procedure. A stethoscope is not. Buying one of these can theoretically increase physician billing and income.

Cool factor- not gonna lie doctors think this is cool as shit.

But more importantly, it’s good for patient care. I’m a big fan of investing in things I think will improve the human condition. See below:

Education- in vivo anatomy and physiology, newly accessible technology with 0 ionizing radiation exposure. (Medical schools, NP schools, PA schools, residency training)

Precision- physicians who perform injections under ultrasound guidance are more confident in their procedures under direct guidance and tend to have better patient satisfaction (first hand experience)

Globalization- entire low income regions can now get 10 ultra portable ultrasound machines for the price of one “full sized machine”, and can completely bypass the high price point of entry. It increases ACCESS to high tech medical care. This is especially useful for remote and low income areas, as well as conflict zones. (Think pregnancy monitoring, coordinating hub and spoke models of care, diagnosing pneumonia, administering injections for children with cerebral palsy etc)

By shamelessly merchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the public to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates). The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company’s promoters. At bottom, the “business model” for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.  
&gt;  
&gt;But a pin lies in wait for every bubble. And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns some very old lessons: First, many in Wall Street ¾ a community in which quality control is not prized ¾ will sell investors anything they will buy. Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.

Warren Buffet wrote this in his year 2000 shareholder letter, which I read for the first time today. It was interesting as it might be something to consider and think about as we continue to fly high. I don't profess to knowing anything about valuations, but clearly we have been doing quite well for quite some time. I, for one, am not intelligent enough to try and beat the market so I just DCA into boring ETFs and funds and am satisfied doing so, but nonetheless, these paragraphs were interesting to me as it seemed to be potentially relevant to all of the news that has been coming out lately.  


With so many new traders and so much more ease of access to the world of finance, hopefully, we see even more transparency and ease of access to information, as well. As I continue to learn and understand more I find there is an increased need for the great input and sharing of ideas that a community like this can provide.   


I am interested to know if you all think we are at risk of, yet again, replicating what Buffet spoke of in 2000.",stocks,Warren Buffet's thoughts from pg 14 of 2000 shareholder letter,65.0,0.94

I see a few different ways to capitalize on this:

Investing in companies that provide hardware for AI: Here I'm most referring to AMD and NVIDIA, their GPUs have become very useful for training AI models and are heavily used all across the industry. They are also not just dependent on AI but gaming as well since their GPUs are used for that as well. [This](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c) should be a good read. Cathie woods is expecting a huge rise in the deep learning / AI Chips market which should definitely benefit these industries. Even at AMD/Nvidia's current levels I think they have room to grow.

Investing in core AI applications company: I'm taking about companies like [C3.AI](https://C3.AI), PLTR (I am very bulling on PLTR) and other companies that provide AI/data analysis based solutions. These have heavy exposure to just AI and are sort of high risk high reward plays, even in the long term.

Investing in big corps that have exposure to AI: Good old MSFT, GOOG and other similar companies. This should keep your money comparatively safer while also giving you think opportunity to capitalize on AI boom.

psychotrader00,0.0,62.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, February 23, 2021**

The market was extremely volatile today. After opening deep in the red, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) was able to reverse to close marginally positive. The sell-off in technology stocks continued, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) once again underperforming. The recent pressure on the market comes after a spike in the 10-year Treasury yield that has market participants concerned that inflation will begin to rise. 

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered his semiannual monetary policy testimony, offering another update on his view for the path forward for monetary policy during and after the pandemic. In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases."" 

In Washington, The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee voted to advance President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion virus relief proposal on Monday, bringing it a step closer to passage ahead of a mid-March cliff, after which federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. 

In the last week or two, market participants have been eyeing a sharp spike in Treasury yields, raising concerns of a surge in borrowing costs and inflationary pressures in the post-pandemic economy. The benchmark 10-year yield hovered around 1.36% for its highest level in a year, after wallowing below 1% for most of 2020. That said, the Treasury yield remains at historically low levels. While we expect the spike in the yield to put pressure on the market, our long-term bull thesis remains intact.

* Cash on balance sheet $540MM as of Sep 2020

**Using a conservative 15x EBITDA multiple off of RR Q3 EBITDA of $48MM (removing gain from sale of subsidiary) = EV of $720MM -&gt; 60% return**

Note: Earnings Wed 2/17

**OLED is Booming**

MX is the largest independent supplier of OLED DDICs which power the display screens, and focused on high frame rate phones. It’s tied to the hip of Samsung and LG and a big winner in the OLED space especially with 5G and will most likely beat their Q4 guidance. OLED and chip manufacturers are fully sold out as per guidance from several semiconductor companies.

For each phone with OLED, there is 1 DDIC. For a rollable or foldable OLED screen, there are more than 1 DDIC chip on average. MX is also getting into laptop, TV, and auto OLED screens which all use more than 1 chip (given larger size).

**Q4 2020 Guidance Beat**

Magnachip Semiconductor Q4 '20 revenue/profits are likely to surprise, here’s why: in their most recent analyst presentation, they said their Q4 guidance put out in Q3 was based on LOWER manufacturing capacity from their foundry partners. That allocation went up.

From the analyst call: ""Our Q4 revenue guidance range was based on allocation from foundry partners for OLED as well as internal Fab 3 ramp-up. We were able to secure greater supply than we originally expected.""

The supply crunch is affecting 8"" fabs and MX focuses on using 12"" foundries which are less tight, and that explains why MX was able to receive more allocation.

In addition, there is likely strong forward guidance given improved margins below...

**Supply Crunch and Potential Acquirer?**

Synaptics, a $3.7bln market cap company that dominates the adjacent semiconductor touch chips for OLED screens (called TDDI, used in all AAPL phones) in their earnings call on Feb 4 said there is a supply crunch in OLED DDICs and a potential for ""a tactical opportunity"":

""Given the supply crunch, we've seen an opening, an opportunity for us for OLED DDICs...The current supply base in OLED DDICs has been compressed..\[On\]...the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity.""

Synaptics acquired an OLED DDIC company in the past (8-9 years ago) and did not make much out of it, focusing on the touch aspect versus the IC chip. However, margins for OLED DDICs are improving based on their comments and bodes well for MX.

HIMX, another company operating in the display panel space (albeit not in OLED), has said that the transition from LCD to OLED screens is happening fast and sees OLED DDIC s as a major opportunity: ""As we have repeatedly indicated, traditional smartphone DDICs are quickly being replaced by TDDI and AMOLED....We believe AMOLED driver IC will soon become one of the major growth drivers for our small- and medium-panel driver IC business in 2021.""

In fact, HIMX said that given the ""helplessly tight"" semiconductor situation. **""We can very often transfer the cost increase to customers and a bit more.""**

**Conclusion**

For a global leader in a key component of OLED displays and with 5G phones / increase in display resolution and frame rates (for video games) and management said in their analyst calls (all online in IR videos) they are sold out in July (and likely Sep) from demand -&gt; drastically undervalued at \~7xEV/EBITDA valuation...

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday’s early gain fizzles and reverses

&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday’s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.

&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street’s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government’s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.

*****

&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill

&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.

*****

&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for ‘every adult’ by end of May

&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate “every adult in America” by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.

&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they’re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.

*****

&gt; # 4. America’s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for ‘Dreamers’

&gt; * America’s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations — including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber — asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.

*****

&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health

&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.

&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.

&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.

woodchip69,0.0,58.0,"A little about myself and situation. Started off with $500 in my account, brought it up to $950+/- in 2 months, mostly luck looking back at it, I didn't really do my own DD at first and it bit me in the ass. I lost all my gains and then some due to lack of knowledge. I FOMO bought and panic sold at a loss instead of doing my research, or reading the charts/indicators prior to entering or exiting a position. I never really had a strategy, I bought stocks that were going up. I did stray away from the GME rally and other Reddit fueled stocks and never got caught up with it, I started back in early December prior  to all of it.

Granted, the past couple weeks have been red for most of us, I haven’t panic sold like I've done prior but I'm trying to take this down time to learn more. I've watched hours of videos from multiple people, but the thing I can't stand is that everyone is trying to push you to ""join my class or group for the small price of $xxx.xx"" so I don't really know who is good to follow or what is a good place to research as 90% of them are trying to sell their product. I've been watching active traders on Twitch and YouTube live recently and honestly have learned more by just watching them and how they navigate daily. 

The past month I've been a lot more cautious, realized that I don’t have to trade real money every day and have been paper trading with some success. I make a decent living for myself at the age of 27 with two kids and a wife, but I'm sure as hell tired of this job away from my family. In 5 years I'd like to be in a position to do this daily as my main source of income and work from home.

The stock market is addicting, all I can say is that after losing my gains due to lack of knowledge it has only fueled me more to dig deep into this shit, put the work in and learn correctly, do my research, and become a full time trader one day. As stated in the title, if anyone has recommendations on individuals to watch, or books to read please pass them on.

- The excess in today’s story stocks—electric cars, clean power and cannabis in particular—surely poses a threat to the wealth of their shareholders. Even if there is a wider bubble, it might not be a catastrophe for the country.

-not all bubbles are equal. The economic dangers of a stock bubble come from people taking on debt to buy shares and from companies overinvesting. 

-When the bubble pops, overextended shareholders have to cut spending or go bankrupt. Companies suddenly faced with investors demanding a return have to lay off workers and slash investment.

-None of this is an issue for the obvious bubbles under way in the fashionable stocks of the moment

-Even if TSLA vanished tomorrow, it would have an insignificant effect on the economy, as Tesla’s operations are tiny. It is mostly equity-financed, so its failure wouldn’t start a domino line of bank failures. And while shareholders would be hurt, there’s no reason to think that would lead to a collapse in spending across the country

-The closest parallel is not the dot-com bubble, for all the similarities, but the British bicycle mania of the 1890s. 671 new bicycle companies, raising £27 million in 1896 alone—equivalent to 1.6% of British gross domestic product that year. By comparison, the fast-growing IPO alternative of SPACs raised only about 0.4% of U.S. GDP last year

- Half these bicycle companies failed by the end of the decade, leading to 71% fall in bicycle stocks in18 months. But the British economy barely noticed this.

What if today’s excesses aren’t just in the speculative story stocks like Tesla, but across the market?  if I’m wrong and shares in the highly valued technology and associated sectors did crash, it probably wouldn’t be that bad. If Apple’s share price halved, it would make no difference to the underlying business. That is different from the dot-coms, which were forced to slash spending when the market crashed, and they lost the ability to issue expensive new shares.

TLDR

-Yes, there are bubbles of story stocks like TSLA now. But they are not funded by bank loans. They may burst, but they will not bring the whole market with them, like the housing bubble of the 2000s that were irresponsibly financed by banks.",stocks,"Interesting article from WSJ: If TSLA bubble bursts, catastrophe won't flow",61.0,0.95

joeroganthumbhead,0.0,77.0,"I hear all the time “you can’t beat the market in the long run”. I believe that there are many simple reasons why most don’t. 

The first reason I think is that people are greedy and once they see a stock move up 100% in 6 months, they get fomo and hop on when really they should not have done so. Then they realize the hype has died and we see a correction where now they are down 15% from ATH, which brings me to my next point.

The second reason is they PANIC. They see their investment loses 15% in a week and they realize they made a mistake. So they sell at a lost and move it to cash. Which brings me to my next point.

Third reason I believe is that they don’t have PATIENCE! If you are convicted that a stock is a strong company, then you have to ride it out and be patient. Strong companies usually will pull through unless they are in a fraudulent situation.

The biggest reasons, imo, are that people can just get greedy and get fomo then lose patience when their greed loses them money.

lightband101,0.0,57.0,"This community has been helpful for providing analysis, advice, and a TON of helpful resources, that being said however I've noticed some toxicity in the sub-reddit as well. Everyone seems to think that they are all gurus in trading, and they have the ""right"" answer. But, the reality is that there are over 1mil+ different ways to trade and be successful. It varies greatly depending on how ""active"" you are in your portfolio. Some people are in there 50 times per day, others maybe 1-2 times per month. What works for one person might not work for another, and so on.

Just because someone has an annual target over 10% doesn't mean they're crazy. Maybe they are in the group that checks their portfolio 50 times per day, and they flip stocks rapidly in the short-term for compounded gains. You think Wall Street day-job traders would accept only a 10% gain per year? lol... Just because someone only invests in blue-chips and not micro-cap stocks ""going to the moon!"" doesn't mean they don't like money. Maybe they just prefer less risk.

In short, it's important to remember that people all are doing very different strategies. There is no single correct answer. Perhaps before assuming anything, people should ask/clarify their approaches first. I normally try to provide my specifics at least in the body of the original post, however I still find that many people skip that part, or just don't agree with it, and then proceed to name-calling, ridiculing, and everything besides actually offering clarity or advice.

We're a great community here, and I appreciate all of you! But please, whenever possible let's work to ask questions and ask for clarity instead of assuming things and being un-helpful.

Hello investors,

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I wanted to talk about the recent market actions.

I think it's imperative to assess the current market environment given not only the magnitude of the changes in the rates markets but also the speed at which it happened.

If this were the sort of correction that occurred in September 2020, I wouldn't reassess at all because that was simply a large whale in the market coming in and driving up the prices and eventually the market corrected itself. Not much movement in yields or other markets.

This time is a bit different as yields have moved significantly, which has a significant impact on not only risk assets (stocks particularly) but also fiscal and monetary policies.

If you recall from the recent market commentaries (see below), I mentioned that in the short to intermediate-term, risk assets are driven by fiscal and monetary policies.

Dramatic changes in interest rates can impact the policies so it is time to reassess where we are.

I typically take four steps to pick out the securities I want to trade and these steps include macroeconomics, technicals, and fundamental analyses. As I've repeatedly said before, the name of the game is piecing together different pieces of puzzles to create a whole picture. You can't just ignore what's happening at the White House when picking out securities.

**That leads me to make one additional comment, the memos in this subreddit are only for those ""actively buying and selling securities"", not for those buy and hold (""BH"") group.**

Don't get me wrong, I am a huge believer in BH strategy. In fact, I suggest you read Warren Buffett's annual letters which went out this past week.

Yes you get to spend less time on markets, pay little taxes, and grow your wealth with discipline.

I have a friend who is an ardent BH person and he keeps trying to convince people ""just buy and hold Disney and Amazon for 20 years!"" Everyone knows that BH is a good path to wealth creation. Don't need to reiterate that or even try to convince people to do that.

I actually do BH on half of my portfolio and actively trade on the other half.

My point is if you are a huge BH believer and don't want to actively trade, please stop trying to convince me or others to do it. We all know it is a good strategy and this is a game against yourself.

Enough with the intro, here are the main topics for today's memo.

4 steps I take to determine what to trade.

1. Determine where we are in the market cycle
2. Decide how we should position ourselves
3. Select which securities will give you the highest return for a unit of risk
4. Allocate appropriate weights

These steps are not mine but a mixture of what I was recommended to do by my mentors, bosses, and other resources.

This accomplishes a few things:- It forces you to step back and see the bigger picture.

\- It allows you to be more objective.

\- It allows you to assess your performance.

**1) Determine where we are in the market cycle**

How is the current market environment? Bullish or bearish? Euphoric or panicky? What changed?

Well, let's look at a few charts to see what's changed.

Equity markets

S&amp;P futures

📷

Nasdaq futures

📷

We are just starting to test the 50D MA for the S&amp;P and have already broken 50D MA for the Nasdaq. It's hard to make any conclusions from these so we move on.

Bond markets

10-year yield

📷

10-year rose almost 100 bps from the lows in August 2020. This is attributable to economic recovery, inflation expectations, and Georgia run-offs.

What's more fascinating is how much the yield curve bear steepened since the peak of the pandemic.

This was what the majority of the market participants were expecting throughout 2020 and post-election but I was very off on the timing of the events. The majority of the steepening happened towards late 2020 and early 2021.

This is an expected development as the economy recovers, inflation expectations soar and treasury market is flooded with new issues.

Below is what's making me more concerned.

📷

The MOVE index is basically the VIX for bond markets. The higher the index the higher the expected volatility in rates. It's still at relatively low levels but the rate at which it is skyrocketing is certainly disturbing.

Why is this all happening?

From what I have gathered, it's the Janet Yellen bomb.

On 2/16, Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, announced her plans to drawdown on TGA (treasury general account, a sort of checking account for the federal government).

📷

What this means is that the Treasury will offload its enormous amount of cash ($1.6 trillion) into the banking system for the banks to be able to perform PPP lending and do all sorts of fiscal policy-related activities in the next 3 months.

The magnitude of this balance is simply enormous. Take a look at the chart below.

📷

We have never ever had TGA balance running above $500 billion and now we have close to 3x that flooding into the banking system.

From another perspective, we have about $3T reserves in the banking system. So that $1.6 trillion adds about 66% over the next few months to the banking system.

This video nicely summarizes what happens in the next few months.

&amp;#x200B;

This provides so much liquidity to the banking system that banks will be buying tons of treasuries, which may push short term rates to the negative territory and experts like the guy in the video anticipate that the Fed may have to actually raise IOER (interest on excess reserves) to prevent rates from falling below zero.

Now, what does all of this mean for the equity markets?

I mentioned before that majority of the bear markets must have some sort of liquidity problems, whether that be short term borrowing rates rising, bid-ask spread widening, or short term rates spread widening.

Right now, there are some signs that the bond markets are volatile but the short term funding rates are so low and so liquid due to the expected TGA drawdown and Fed purchases.

**In conclusion, the way I see it, we are likely still in the recovery phase of the market cycle but we are experiencing intermittent corrections on the way. The Fed has not changed its policy stance, the gov't is continuing to push its stimulus plans, and the markets are flooded with liquidity.**

Yes, higher long-end rates will inevitably bring down the valuations because by definition, higher rates result in higher discount rates and thus lower present value of future cash flows.

Yet, take a look at the chart below published by Bloomberg.

📷

During most of the periods when the 10-year treasury yields rose, S&amp;P rose together. And this makes sense because yields rising indicates that the economy is growing, which translates to bullish equity markets.

**2) Decide how we should position ourselves**

My mentor once told me that you can never guess where the rates or stock price will move, but you can probabilistically bet on those movements.

Let's say you are betting on 10yr treasury futures. Do you think it's more likely to go from 1.4% to 2% by the end of 2021 or 1.4% to 0.8%?

We can never guess where it's going to go but I think we can all agree that it is more likely to move up than down.

Same for stocks. You can never guess where NVDA will go but in the next 2-3 years, it will likely be higher than it is now.

**My point is that we should position ourselves to benefit from a probabilistic standpoint, not predicting rates movement or stock price movements.**

This brings us back to the idea of convexity. As long as we make bets that yield asymmetrical returns, you just need to win half of your bets because on average, you will be up ahead.

Theoretically, out of ten stocks, you only need to win five and those five will asymmetrically outperform your losers. If your losers lose 10% on avg, your winners will win 20% on avg and you end up winning on net.

**Given that it is more likely that we are still in the recovery phase of the market cycle, I believe that we should position ourselves cautiously aggressive.**

I don't believe we are headed for a bear market, yet. We will likely see an intense correction (5-10% drawdown on S&amp;P) but we won't see anything like 25-30% for a bear market period of 8 months.

Therefore, however deep this correction may go (and it may go further), it is a buy-the-dip opportunity.

With that said, don't underestimate how long this potential correction may last. It may last for 1 month, 3 months, or even 10 months. Buy the dip is not as simple as buying when the markets go down but you have to think about your carrying costs if you use options (theta decay) or margin calls.

**Remember, Nasdaq had five +15% corrections on its way to the 2000 top.**

📷

📷

**Therefore, I am buying the dips in small amounts. I would spend 5-10% of your capital on every dip that happens on a daily basis. This way, you get at least 2 weeks worth of time to deploy your capital.**

**3) Select which securities will give you the highest return for a unit of risk**

This really depends on your risk appetite and your views. I will simply share mine in hopes to provide a guide for everyone but it is up to you to do your due diligence and make sure you are comfortable with what you are holding.

At the moment, below are my plays.

Stocks

\- Short-term, leveraged longs (options, margins, etc.): OZON, FUTU, FVRR, FRHC, ENVA, TIGR, OPEN, SKLZ, PDD

\- Long-term, BH longs: TTD, ETSY, NTES, JD, TWLO

Bonds

\- Long 5/30 spread

Commodities

\- Long gold

Currency

\- Bitcoin

**4) Allocate appropriate weights**

Weight allocation is just as important as security selection, as it expresses your conviction and magnitude of expected price moves. Below are my allocations (rough percentages because it's hard to compare futures and shorts in percentage terms).

Stocks (80%)

\- Short-term, leveraged longs (options, margins, etc.): OZON, FUTU, FVRR, FRHC, ENVA, TIGR, OPEN, SKLZ

\- Long-term, BH longs: TTD, PDD, ETSY, NTES, JD, TWLO

Bonds (10%)

\- Long 5/30 spread

Commodities (5%)

\- Long gold

Currency (5%)

\- Bitcoin

**Summary**

Look at the bigger picture, see what's happening across not just equities but other asset classes, and determine where we are in the market cycle.

Be very careful with security selection and do not put all eggs in one.

I am also constantly learning. I had no idea the yield would take this long to break 1.5%. I had no idea gold would underperform. It's a game where you learn constantly and I would also appreciate any critiques on any topic I discuss.

1. First off, right at the beginning of the year, an article came out on the New York Times about the massive wind turbine  Haliade-X  they've built in the Netherlands. This monster is the size of two 2 football fields and can power a small city. This is lead model for a series of more turbines in the works to come. Just look at this beast of a [windmill](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/business/GE-wind-turbine.html).
2. On that note, The Motley Fool put out this article yesterday announcing G&amp;E's plan to set in motion construction of their  [V236-15.0 MW model](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/12/ges-rival-vestas-launches/) and they too seem to think it could look like a rise is on the way. Also, I don't know about you guys, but renewable energy is pretty dang cool to me. 
3. They have also announced some really exciting news for the automobile industry. Yes, flying cars are about to be real. ""The [EV600 electric van](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/gm-unveils-ev-van-as-part-of-new-commercial-unit-fedex-first-customer.html) is scheduled to go on sale later this year through a new commercial business unit of GM’s called BrightDrop.

Now they look like inflated helicopters and I don't think it will be a revolutionary model, but it will certainly peak investor's attention. 
4. As of me writing this, [Larry Ramer](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/general-electrics-power-and-renewables-units-are-surging-2021-02-10) of *InvestoPlace* has held a long standing position in G&amp;E. He notes their projects moving forward will be a crucial step to leading our goals to eliminate the use of coal in the U.S. by 2033. I am willing to bet this factor alone will mean a significant rise in G&amp;E's stock within the upcoming 10 years. 
5. There's a decent amount of analysts recommending to [buy the stock right now.](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ge)
6. Yesterday, they also announced a partnership with Intel to expand the use of renewable energy in Portland. *Environmental Energy Leader* reports  that ""In 2020, PGE and Avangrid Renewables [announced](https://portlandgeneral.com/news/2020-02-11-portland-general-electric-and-avangrid-renewables-announce-major) the development of a 162-megawatt solar facility – the largest in Oregon – to meet the needs of [17 Green Future Impact subscribers](https://portlandgeneral.com/news/2019-08-21-sustainability-leaders-claim-pges-green-future-impact-in-record). That project is expected to come online in late 2021.""

**Cons**

Here's a quick list of some things that do concern me about the companies outcome:

* Portland General Electric has a bit of notoriety when it comes to power outages. 
* General Electric [had to lay off many employees at the start of COVID-19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-cut-aviation-workforce-as-coronavirus-grounds-airliners-11584972724), a factor that indicates the companies lack of preparation to crisis. Laying off masses of employees is also very bad PR and it seems to have played in important role to the companies drop in price when the pandemic hit. 
* There's also a LOT of outrage about their [25% cut of aviation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-cut-aviation-workforce-as-coronavirus-grounds-airliners-11584972724) jobs back in May of 2020 for the same reasons explained above.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I think the good news outweigh the bad ones for G&amp;E. I think it looks really promising especially considering what they have been able to work on during this year. As of now, I only have 2 shares because I am out of a job, but I plan to go back to work soon and do look to buy more when my next paycheck comes in the mail. What are you guys' thoughts?

The US added back the most jobs in four months in February, as falling coronavirus cases, an increase in the pace of vaccinations, and easing social distancing guidelines are allowing many businesses to reopen. Non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 in February, or well above the 200,000 expected. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2%, unexpectedly improving compared to January's 6.3%. The February jobs report also included a notable upward revision to payroll. January’s payroll gain was revised up to 166,000 from the tepid 49,000 previously reported.

In response to the positive jobs reports, Treasury yields rose once again to hover near its one-year high. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 1.6% today before dipping to 1.557% at the time of writing. As a reminder, high expectations of economic growth causes Treasury yields to rise as the demand for bonds drops in order to make them more attractive. 

Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

Texas said Tuesday that it was lifting its mask requirement and would allow businesses to fully reopen, the most expansive step by any state to remove coronavirus restrictions as Americans across the country are eager to emerge after a year of isolation in the pandemic. 

Senate Democrats struck a last-minute agreement Friday to set federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week, down from the $400 passed by the House, but extend their duration by more than a month as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a Democratic aide. Democrats hope to pass the bill before the mid-March cliff where enhanced federal unemployment benefits from the previous relief package expire.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Billy-Klein,0.0,58.0,"Hey guys, for my Bachelor Thesis I am working with GARCH-Models, that is a tool for Time Series Analysis of a given Dataset to **predict future Volatility**.

Beforehand, one problem with PLTR is that I don't have enough data because the stock is pretty new, so when I take the adjusted daily closing prices I only have 100 time steps, a better forecast would use around 1000-2000 data points.

Nevertheless, we assume that the returns of our time series follow a normal distribution with zero mean and a finite variance.

When finally fitting our given data set to a GARCH(1,1) model we get an **Expected Volatility for tomorrow's closing price of 7.47%.**

**That means our closing price tomorrow has a high likelihood to be in the range of 24.75 USD to 28.75 USD (about 68% chance), with higher probability of the price being centered around the middle and less probability the further we move away.**

That means if the price drops much below that range, there is a high chance of going back up, and when the price goes really high, there is a high chance of going back down again and land in those ranges given above for tomorrow's close.

So, there are certain IF's in my assumptions and lack of data, but nevertheless I just wanted to throw this in and write it down, maybe it helps someone.

**Edit: Don't forget that this is just about modeling volatility and nothing else. Since returns are almost random it is very unlikely to give an exact forecast for tomorrow's return!**

**The higher the volatility, the larger the range of tomorrow's expected closing price, so you may have an idea about how much you can realistically gain or lose in a single day.**",stocks,"$PLTR Volatility Forecast and Price Range - Wed, 24 Feb",58.0,0.81

LemmingPractice,0.0,58.0,"The Score Media and Gaming is a Toronto based sports media company. If you are in North America, you are probably aware of The Score's sports app, which is the second most used sports app on the continent, behind only ESPN.

The Score started as a 24 hour sports broadcaster in Canada way back in 1997 (under the name Headline Sports, before rebranding to The Score). Eventually, they sold their broadcasting assets to Rogers Communications for $167M.

In their time as a sports network, they had developed Canada's most popular multi-sports app, and they kept their digital assets after the sale of the TV channel, and spun them off into a new company. That company (SCR) traded on the TSX Venture exchange until 2020, and then got uplisted to the TSX.

[I am writing about the company now, because as of probably tomorrow, SCR is being uplisted to the Nasdaq.](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1364665634626416645)

**Why Should I Care?**

For years, The Score has been growing it's presence, in the digital space. [As of late 2019, The Score had 4.3 million users worldwide, with 62% of them in the US, 27% in Canada and 11% in other international markets.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_Media_and_Gaming_Inc)

Once you have a platform that reaches that many people, the question is: how do you cash in on it? Up until recently, the play had been pure advertising, but the long term play had always been much bigger: **Sports Betting**.

The Score decided to enter the sports betting industry as an operator, commencing in the New Jersey market in late 2019. They started with market share of about 0.45% in Q1 2020, and steadily increased that to 1.3% by Q4 of 2020. Management reported an increase of 500% in total handle in September 2020 vs September 2020, with the trend holding in October.

In the last 6 months, they have launched in three more markets (Colorado, Indiana and Iowa).

But, none of this is the exciting part...

**Ok, so what's the exciting part?**

While The Score's app is popular in the US, it is omnipresent in it's home market of Canada. The Score is not only the top sports app in Canada, it has about twice the monthly users as the second place sports app (which is TSN...ie. Canada's version of ESPN).

Single sports betting is still currently illegal in Canada, but Bill C-218 is being fast-tracked to change that. [It passed it's second reading on February 17, 2021 with overwhelming support across all major parties](https://openparliament.ca/bills/43-2/C-218/). Next in the process is committee stage ([which is literally occurring as I write this](https://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20210225/-1/34842)), then the final reading and royal assent. There is no guarantee on the speed a bill will pass through Parliament, but with all parties supporting it, the bill could become law within weeks.

Bill C-218 would leave it to individual provinces to regulate, with the elephant in the room being Ontario, which has about 35-40% of Canada's population.

In November of 2020, [the Ford government in Ontario promised legislation which would end the provincial lottery's current monopoly on legal online casino games](https://www.onlinepokerreport.com/45574/ontario-ford-government-promises-online-gambling-legislation/). Sports gambling is expected to be part of this shift as soon as the feds give the ok. With Michigan legalizing single sports betting, and all the tax money currently being lost to off-share operators (part of the justification for the casino game shift), sports betting in Ontario could be open for private operators as early as this year.

And, if that happens, SCR becomes an unbelievable play.

The Score's largest market is it's home market of Ontario. It is based in Toronto. When it was a TV network it's open-window studio at King and John was a local landmark. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that almost every serious sports fan in Ontario already has the Score App on their phone.

[The Score has 1.4M active monthly users in Ontario.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46185/canada-sports-betting-winners/#:~:text=Toronto%2Dbased%20TheScore%20estimated%20a,in%20annual%20gross%20gaming%20revenue) For a province with about 14.5M people, that's about 10% of every man, woman and child in the province who uses The Score's app regularly.

[The Ontario sports betting market is estimated to be worth between $1.5B and $2.1B in gross annual revenues](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46185/canada-sports-betting-winners/#:~:text=Toronto%2Dbased%20TheScore%20estimated%20a,in%20annual%20gross%20gaming%20revenue).

The hardest part about growing as a sports betting operator is user acquisition. The Score already has that taken care of. Their target market is already checking sports scores on their app. It's not a big move to get those interested in gambling on those games to also use the same app.

They have their app already loaded on the phones of most of their target market, and have a brand advantage with a decades-long head start on any American competitors who try to enter the market.

[The Score's revenue over the last 12 months is just over $20M.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCR.TO/financials?p=SCR.TO) **If we are conservative, and estimate that they achieve a 10% market share in Ontario, that's about 150M to $210M in revenue**. Meaning, that **Ontario revenues alone could increase the Score's annual revenue by 7.5 to 10.5 times their current levels**.

...and that's just one Canadian market. The Score is the top sports app across Canada, and will have easy footholds into other Canadian markets once they open, too. They are a local Canadian player who have never skirted the rules by operating offshore, and who have expertise operating in heavily regulated markets since they were a broadcaster. As such, they are a prime candidate for any Canadian government to support through the regulatory process.

Ontario represents about 35-40% of Canada's population, so the above revenue projections are only the start. Markets in Alberta, BC, Quebec, and other smaller provinces would be significant boons to follow.

And, of course, as the #2 sports app in the US, The Score is constantly entering new American markets. Iowa just opened in the last couple of weeks. [A Score representative just testified before the Ohio Senate Select Committee yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamblingstocks/comments/lrq2ot/for_an_inside_scoop_read_the_scrs_testimony_today/). Being publicly listed and regulated on the Nasdaq can only help The Score's push to be regulated in more and more US markets.

One of the things that any marijuana stock investor has seen over the years is that legalization provides numerous catalysts for stock growth. Rumours of legalization, election of pro-legalization representatives, each step of the legislative process, etc. There are tons of catalysts that we will see as sports betting gets legalized across Canada and the US...and the next catalyst is the Nasdaq uplist tomorrow, which will allow ETF and other institutional investors to buy into the stock. While there isn't official confirmation that the uplist will be tomorrow, whether it is tomorrow or next week, the uplist should be a serious catalyst for the stock, both short and long term.

[With their IPO on the Nasdaq, The Score has secured funding of $162M](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224006208/en/theScore-Announces-Pricing-of-Upsized-Initial-Public-Offering-in-the-United-States#:~:text=The%20underwriters%20have%20agreed%20to,announced%205%2C000%2C000%20Class%20A%20Shares). So, they are also flush with cash to pursue all the growth opportunities I discussed above.

**...But there's more**

While sports betting will be the big short term driver of the stock, there is another driver which is probably coming behind it: eSports betting.

While The Score hasn't announced plans to launch an eSports betting platform, the move seems like a no-brainer.

The CEO of The Score, John Levy, has his sons work with him at the company. They each work in different areas, and one of them happens to be big into eSports. So, dad let him run with it and build an eSports platform. [At the time that I write this, The Score eSports has 1.64M subscribers on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSCoziKHqjqbox3Fv3Pb4BA).

They have recently started using their background in broadcasting, and their platform in eSports, and [obtained exclusive English broadcasting rights for the League of Legends Demacia Championship](https://mobile.thescore.com/2020/12/thescore-esports-named-exclusive-english-language-broadcast-partner-for-league-of-legends-demacia-championship/).

The formula they used with the sports app was: create the platform, acquire the users, then find a way to monetize it (ie. sports betting).

Once The Score makes their push into sports betting, is there any reason why they wouldn't use the exact same technology, along with their eSports presence, to push into eSports betting?

It just seems like such an obvious next step which, at the moment, has a very low barrier to entry.

This is an emerging area, which most of the big sports betting players don't currently participate in, but is one that could see major growth in future years (especially as the comparably young demographics of eSports players get old enough to legally bet). With an existing eSports platform to leverage, and a sports betting platform already operating, The Score are positioned very well to take advantage of this future growth driver, when the time is right.

**Conclusion**

In recent years, we have seen a ton of retail investors enter the market. A lot of them have their main investments with a broker, while they use their investment ""fun money"" to day trade. The companies that you are seeing inflate to wild valuations right now are companies that engage in ""fun"" highly visible industries which appeal to those retail investors.

With that context: Oh, what a time to be a business with huge growth prospects in sports betting and esports!

As Canadian legalization has come closer, The Score saw a run-up in it's value up to a high of $5.67/share. Over the last week, they executed a 10:1 reverse share split, in order to facilitate their Nasdaq entry. Between that, profit taking, the announcement of the IPO share sales, and a couple of generally bad market days, the stock's value has dropped down to about $35.70/share (equivalent of $3.61 if compared to pre-reverse split prices). That value is in Canadian dollars, so the equivalent of about 28.42 in USD.

With all that now priced into the stock, this looks like the perfect time to get in. As of tomorrow (probably), when the Nasdaq listing goes up, US institutional investors and ETF's will be able to get in on the stock. Once further catalysts hit, for legalization and opening, The Score has a chance to soar in value.

Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor. This is not investment advice. This is for entertainment purposes only. Do your own due diligence.

Disclosure: I currently own 800 shares of The Score, with 500 of those shares being added this week, and I may increase my position further in the coming days.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-22-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street set to open lower on rising bond yield concerns

&gt; * U.S. stocks futures fell Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is set to open down about 0.5%, with the Nasdaq indicated off double that, as Treasury yields continued to push higher. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, traded Monday at about 1.37%, the highest level in almost one year. Finishing little changed Friday, the Dow eked out a third straight weekly gain, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq broke two week winning streaks. However, February’s solid monthly gains remained intact for all three stock benchmarks.

*****

&gt; # 2. B/itcoin slips from records as Musk tweets it seems high

&gt; * B/itcoin dropped about 7% on Monday, one day topping $58,000 for another all-time high. B/itcoin, the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency, exceeded a market value of $1 trillion Friday. Elon Musk, whose Tesla is estimated to have made about $1 billion in profit on its b/itcoin investment, tweeted early Saturday morning that b/itcoin seems high. Shares of Tesla — up 325% in the past 12 months — fell nearly 3% in Monday’s premarket.

*****

&gt; # 3. PPP loans tweaked to try to reach even smaller businesses

&gt; * President Joe Biden is launching changes Monday to the Paycheck Protection Program to try to reach smaller, minority-owned firms and sole proprietors left behind in previous rounds of aid. For two weeks, starting Wednesday, the Small Business Administration will only accept applications for forgivable PPP loans from firms with fewer than 20 employees. The program was relaunched last month with $284 billion in new funds from a Covid relief bill passed in late December. About $150 billion of PPP money is still available, according to a Biden administration official.

*****

&gt; # 4. Total U.S. Covid deaths near 500,000; Biden plans remembrance

&gt; * While daily U.S. Covid deaths have been dropping in recent weeks, total fatalities from the disease in America, the highest of any single country in the world, could exceed 500,000 as soon as Monday, based on data from Johns Hopkins University. When it happens, Biden plans to mark the sad milestone with a moment of silence and candle lighting ceremony at the White House. The latest daily numbers show an average of 1,872 people died over the past seven days, down from a single-day record of 4,407 on Jan. 12. Daily new cases averaged 69,986 over the past seven days. The highest single day of new cases was just under 300,000 on Jan. 2.

*****

&gt; # 5. United takes two dozen Boeing 777s out of service after engine failure

&gt; * United Airlines will temporarily remove 24 of its Boeing 777s from service after one of the planes bound for Honolulu suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The plane returned to Denver safely. Images from the flight on social media showed an engine on fire and reports on the ground near the airport said engine parts rained down.
The FAA ordered the inspection of some Boeing 777 jetliners powered by the same Pratt &amp; Whitney engine, the PW4000. Boeing shares fell 3% in premarket trading. Raytheon, which owns Pratt &amp; Whitney, dropped 2%. United shares slipped less than 1%.

Which to an extent, I can understand (I am a new trader myself), as I imagine some folks don't want to have to sift through all the noise on their favorite subreddits.

But I think there's a flip side to this, and curious to hear peoples opinion on it.  Doesn't all the brand spanking new investors bode well for the long term?  My thought is: A lot of these people who got swept up in the GME YOLO wave and all that are not going to stick around, but there has to be a decent amount who have always been interested in stocks and didn't jump in before.

Some of the latter who are sticking around to learn (I hope I am one of these) will eventually turn into knowledgeable traders who provide more money, new ideas or DD and better discussion right?

Also, from what I understand of frozen concentrated orange juice, the market is brutal to the consistently foolish and emotional traders.  One the flip side of the coin will be people who can't handle it and get chewed up and spit out by everyone else.  I hope these kind of traders can get out without getting hurt too badly.

Charlie Munger said Warren and him have 3 general rules.

1.) A business with some intrinsic characteristics that give it some durable competitive advantage.

2.) Management in place with a lot of integrity and talent

3.) Finally, no matter how wonderful it is it cannot have an infinite price, we have to have a price that makes sense

RKT checks all these boxes which really gets me thinking “is it too good to be true?”. 

RKT is a holding company that has tons of subsidiaries in mortgage lending, making it the largest mortgage lender in the U.S. so it’s definitely a company I wouldn’t mind owning in 10 years. 

I am well aware that RKT is very new to the public, and I don’t think that’s a problem, I think it’s an opportunity considering how well established it is. 

I should also point out it has reliable earnings since it’s recent IPO mid 2020, and it’s low P/E ratio is very attractive. 

I’m interested in selling puts with about 20% of my portfolio at a strike of $20. In other words I’m looking to buy it at $20/share. When factoring in premium the price in which I buy will be much lower, and the premium will be a 1% gain which in my eyes is a jackpot! I know this isn’t an options community so bear with me...

In my case, 10k in collateral for 5 contracts at around .20 per share in premium expiring next Friday. If the contracts aren’t exercised then I repeat the process and make a whole bunch of money ultimately lowering the cost basis. If I do get exercised I collect 500 shares at $19.80, far below what I believe to be its intrinsic value.

*A Brief Explanation on EHang’s Mission, Technological Advancements and Why the Short-Seller is Wrong*

GUANGZHOU, China, Feb. 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EHang Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: EH) (“EHang” or the “Company”), the world's leading autonomous aerial vehicle (“AAV”) technology platform company, today invites its founder, Mr. Huazhi Hu, to explain EHang’s mission, technological advancements, as well as his thoughts on a report by a short-seller, Wolfpack Research, dated February 16, 2021.  


**Question 1:** Why did you start EHang? What is EHang’s mission?

**Mr. Huazhi Hu (“Mr. Hu”):** I founded EHang to make air mobility accessible for ordinary people. We envision that, in the foreseeable future, fast, efficient and door-to-door public air transportation within and between cities will become a reality. At EHang, we work hard every day striving to realize this dream.

**Question 2:** According to the short-seller report, many of EHang’s competitors did not jump straight to an autonomous platform without first proving the concept with a human pilot in the aircraft. Why hasn’t EHang tried to commercialize piloted AAVs as a first step?

**Mr. Hu:** We believe that efficient urban air transportation should not require every customer to acquire a pilot license. It is neither practical nor safe.

Autonomous vehicles are safer and more efficient for urban transportations if we have an intelligent command-and-control center to manage all vehicles. Therefore, EHang did not set out to make a lighter version of helicopters. In fact, our first passenger-grade model unveiled in January 2016, the EHang 184, was fully autonomous. We firmly believe that autonomous vehicles are the key to bringing air mobility to the mass population.

**Question 3:** Why is EHang developing a comprehensive AAV platform? Why doesn’t EHang outsource the development of AAV infrastructure, such as command-and-control centers, to third-party partners? The short-seller appeared to think it is a better idea. The short-seller claimed that to get a network in place with certified vehicles would cost 5 to 10 billion dollars.

**Mr. Hu:** As I mentioned earlier, EHang’s strategy is to make autonomous vehicles that are suitable for urban transportation. By design, autonomous vehicles must be operated by command-and-control centers. In fact, command-and-control centers, takeoff and landing facilities, and charging equipment are all crucial parts of EHang’s point-to-point air transportation solution.

Equally important, command-and-control technology is one of EHang’s core competences. Our team has extensive experience in designing large-scale command-and-control systems. We believe we have a deep understanding of command-and-control systems and know how to use them to revolutionize urban air mobility.

Nevertheless, command-and-control centers and other AAV infrastructure do not have to entail huge amounts of monetary investments by ourselves. On the contrary, they are part of our technological solutions and are a revenue generator for EHang.

**Question 4:** What are EHang’s core technological strengths?

**Mr. Hu:** As early as in 2017, we led the global AAV industry in completing the development and testing of the Full Redundancy System. Moreover, we have proprietarily completed the development of core technologies including, among others, the High Performance Propulsion System, the Two-way Communication Detectable Senseless FOC Motor Driver, the Multi-redundancy Automatic Flight Control System, the High Performance Self-adaptive Flight Control Algorithm, the Single Node Controllable Redundancy Battery Management System, the Multi-redundancy Internal Communication Bus System, the Multi-redundancy Air-Ground Communication System, the Automatic Unmanned Logic Decision System, the Multi-Aircraft Cooperative Flight Mission Planning and Management System and the All-weather Automatic Obstacle Avoidance System.

Although these core technologies sound complicated, they are centered on three most important principles: Safety, Autonomous control and Eco-friendliness.

As of December 31, 2020, we have acquired a large number of patents related to Autonomous Aerial Vehicles. The total number of patents registered or applied for amounts to 343. We are a leader in Autonomous Aerial Vehicles globally. Especially, we have developed a comprehensive team of core in-house experts and engineers who have been with the Company for many years, whom we value deeply as our biggest assets.

**Question 5:** The short-seller questioned why EHang was able to make even bigger achievements with much smaller investments than its global peers. They said that some firms were nowhere close to commercializing its AAVs after investing US$499 million in one year.

**Mr. Hu:** We focused on AAV R&amp;D since 2014. We have gained financial backing from leading global VCs, and, since 2017, we have made approximately US$37 million investments on our R&amp;D. We appreciate the trust from our investors, and we do not have a culture of burning money for white elephant money-pit projects. Every penny counts. We have relied on a group of dedicated engineers with diligence, intelligence and persistence. This is who we are. The achievement also proves that our development strategies of pursuing AAVs, not manned air vehicles, has been correct.

Money is not everything. As an engineer by training, I am very proud of our achievements at such a low cost. Only snobs will overestimate the power of money but underestimate the power of will of self-devoting engineers.

Going forward, as we are a listed company with a better access to capital markets, we plan to more aggressively invest in R&amp;D to strengthen our technology leadership in the AAV industry.

**Question 6:** How does EHang manage its production quality? As you know, EHang’s AAVs are intended for passenger transportation. The short-seller report cited an expert who allegedly had a long career at NASA to claim that EHang used “hobby-grade motors’ made by a Chinese hobby motor company, T-Motor, to manufacture the EH216.

**Mr. Hu:** It is absolutely wrong to allege that we use any motors or propellers made by T-Motor in our EH216. That expert must not have checked our EH216 in person. Starting from our first-generation passenger-grade model, the EHang 184, we have used motors that are proprietarily designed and manufactured by our designated supplier. In as early as 2015, we had established a variety of dynamic testing systems to conduct a large number of tests on our proprietarily designed motors. Regarding the motor product made by T-Motor that we allegedly used, we believe T-Motor only started to sell that product after we have conducted a large number of trial flights of EH216. The T-Motor motors are significantly different from our motor products in both technical performance and physical appearance.

We have established rigorous procedures to ensure the quality of our AAVs. Each AAV must go through a strict quality control process.

**Question 7:** Tell us about the trial flights of your AAVs. Can you please tell us your own experiences of riding on EH216? How many rides have you taken so far?

**Mr. Hu:** Of course. I am the first passenger of our AAV and still a regular flyer. Nothing will make me more joyful than riding on an EH216 to look down at the beautiful landscape.

Since 2017, we have taken over 10,000 trial flights with our AAVs in 41 cities and 8 countries. Our AAVs have passed rigorous tests with empty-load, cargo-load, and passenger-load. Many people have experienced the flights in our AAVs.

**Question 8:** Can you elaborate more on regulatory approvals? How long do you think it will take for the urban air mobility dream to come true?

**Mr. Hu:** So far we have worked closely with the CAAC on airworthiness certification for our EH216. We have been also invited by authorities from various countries for similar certifications. We believe our product is the best-in-class. We will proactively cooperate with the authorities in the most rigorous tests. We intend to launch more regular flights in more countries. While there remains a long way to go, I believe we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

**Question 9:** Do you have any other comments on the short-seller report?

**Mr. Hu:** Many investors believe in EHang’s mission and technological advancements, while others may have doubts. This is normal, and we need to do a better job to help more investors understand our business. Short-selling reports are tools used by certain profit seekers on the capital market – I get that. But this short-seller did not attempt to understand EHang’s technologies and business model. Its report was based on shoddy research and contains numerous errors, unsubstantiated statements, and misinterpretation of information. In addition to the issues I have directly addressed earlier, we have the following responses to some other false allegations made by this short-seller:

* ***Contracts with Kunxiang.*** The short-seller falsely accused that Kunxiang, a customer of EHang, is also a shareholder of EHang and signed “sham” sales contracts to benefit its investment. The truth is that Kunxiang has never been a shareholder of EHang prior to our IPO, and to the best of our knowledge, after our IPO either. The pricing and other terms offered by EHang to Kunxiang are not substantially different from those offered to other major customers in China and all contracts with Kunxiang are based on arm-length transactions.
* ***Production Facilities.*** The short-seller falsely accused that EHang’s headquarters and manufacturing facility was “practically empty” during their alleged “visits.” The truth is that EHang’s existing Guangzhou manufacturing base spans a total area of 8,750 square meters and houses production facilities for our AAVs. We are building a new factory in Yunfu, Guangdong with a planned initial capacity of 600 units of passenger-grade AAVs per year. Our security cameras did capture that a man disguised as a delivery person trespassed on one of our facilities around the time indicated by the short-seller but their photos and where they shot them are intentionally misleading. We receive regular business and regulator visits frequently to our facilities and all interested parties are invited to visit us once international travels are allowed.
* ***EHang GZ.*** The short-seller falsely accused that the equity interest of Guangzhou EHang Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“EHang GZ”) “likely” had been frozen by a Chinese court due to debts of EHang GZ. The truth is that EHang GZ is not a defendant to the underlying proceeding at all, as the short-seller admitted itself in the screenshot it presented. The legal proceeding cited by the short-seller involves an arbitration proceeding among EHang’s pre-IPO shareholders, has nothing to do with the RMB$40 million redeemable non-controlling interests on our balance sheet and is not expected to have any material adverse impact on EHang’s business or results of operations.  


As always, EHang is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, as well as transparent and timely disclosure in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company remains focused on pioneering the future of transportation and creating value for shareholders over the long term.

Chthroop,0.0,52.0,"Hi, new to the board but long time investor and formerly worked on Wall Street

Reviewing the potential for the upcoming Roblox ipo.  Here my thoughts on Pro/con on Roblox

Pro:
1. Cool business model with an entire ecosystem that drives content creation through simplified game development allowing “citizen developers” to create content which Roblox gets 30% of any revenue.  Ultra scalable content development model

2. Fits into overall trend of video game nation which is clearly where the world in general is going

3. Hasn’t even tapped the China/Asia market in any material way

Cons:

1. Not demonstrated to be able to keep kids outside the 4-10 age demographic. I have kids who played roblox and the games were really mini games. They then moved on to minecraft, fortnite, etc.   

2. While the cool part is the simple way to develop games, it also inherently limits the quality and depth of games vs true coding efforts and engines like Epic Unreal engine

3. Valuation is sky high. 7x valuation from 4bn to 29bn in one year? And this is the private round so assume people want a public valuation of 40bn+??? Compared to existing firms like Rockstar (23bn) or Electronic Arts (42bn) that very rich.  

Net net: i like the overall name but as my personal investment approach is growth at a reasonable price, i will hold off but watch the name closely to see if post ipo there is a dip to a valuation i would find acceptable in the 20-30bn range

Thoughts?  What key elements of the story am i missing??",stocks,Pro/Con of Roblox - expecting IPO in March. Last round valuation of over 29$ billion with a 7x growth in 2020,52.0,0.91
ExcellentNoThankYou,0.0,53.0,"Robinhood Markets Inc., the trading platform behind the boom-and-bust swing in GameStop Corp.’s shares, plans to file confidentially for an initial public offering as soon as March, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company has held talks in the past week with underwriters about moving forward with a filing within weeks, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. No final decision has been made and the timing could change, the people said.

A representative for Robinhood, based in Menlo Park, California, declined to comment.

Robinhood exploded in popularity during the pandemic as homebound young people turned to its trading app to make money and pass the time. The company, which has been targeting a 2021 IPO since at least last year, faced a cash crunch when it ran into regulatory trouble three weeks ago.

Robinhood had to draw down its credit lines and raise $3.4 billion from its backers to post more collateral with the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp., the industry’s clearinghouse. The DTCC wanted members to post more cash to ensure they could clear trades, given wild swings in stocks including video game retailer GameStop and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

Robinhood is also facing political and customer backlash because it temporarily curbed trading in GameStop and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

Robinhood is also facing political and customer backlash because it temporarily curbed trading in GameStop and other stocks.

Robinhood was valued at $11.7 billion in a funding round last year. That company has been considering selling some of its shares in its IPO directly to its own users, Bloomberg News reported. Such a move would be striking because retail investors usually don’t get to buy into new listings at the offering price. Instead, they typically have to invest on the first day of trading in a rush that can drive up the stock price.

xAshraxx,0.0,51.0," 

$TSM - I am in with a cost average at $102. I first invested in it at $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.

They have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.

I don't think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. [Stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us/) has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $150 next week. I tend to be a bit bullish on TSM and I see this chip shortage being the catalyst that can give us a strong first quarter. With the chip shortage being fueled by the high demand in the auto industry among all the new smart technology devices.

I don't believe investing in TSM or into any position for just 1 reason or even for somebody else's reasons is wise. It's easy to pull up the graph and see the upward trend but I am trying to focus on need for TSM products and the ways they plan on increasing production.

How and if you choose to invest in TSM is up to you. I am long TSM and I am interested in the following as well.

daybreaker17,0.0,54.0,"This sincerely is a bit distressing because I put a fair bit of money some time ago (hundreds of dollars each into diff stocks, not thousands or tens of thousands like some people on here so easily seem to toss).

These are companies I've believed in, and have felt they will do great long-term, but now?  Some of them are now meme stonks, and they're getting to be pumped too much by everyone trying to make a quick buck.

Yeah, I should be happy for the gains, but do you realize what that does to a company to skyrocket and then come crashing back down?  Especially once the media starts talking about X or Y company being the next big Reddit stock?  It makes regular investors grow leary of the stock afterwards, and the businesses are then lumped in with the /wsb stonks that were hyped.

What should have been steady month-over-month climbs for some of these have now made me feel like I have to watch my holdings like a hawk for when everyone starts dumping so I don't just not only lose out on earnings, but end up with shares that are valued much less than what I paid for them.

Is anyone else in the same boat?

happy-tripping,0.0,50.0,"Any thoughts on KOPN? I don't have time to do a full DD but here are some thoughts:

**KOPN (Kopin Corporation)** is best known for its display devices for mobile electronics. The company was founded by engineers from MIT and currently holds hundreds of patents that are applicable to **Augmented Reality**. Some of the most promising patents involve wearable technology and voice recognition-based headsets. 

In the past several years, Kopin has contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense to research wearable head-mounted computers for soldiers. They have supplied defense technology for several defense companies including Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, and BAE. But defense is just a fractional part of Kopin's growth potential. 

**I believe that Kopin is set to be a breakout company in the Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) sectors.** Kopin's VR technology is already a market leader. Their OLED microdisplays have the highest frame rates and resolution rates with the smallest sizes and lowest power consumption. They also have a voice-activated microchip technology called Whisper, which they claim is 200% better than other voice-recognition chips in the market. Cathie Woods recently talked about AR/VR in her 2021 Big Ideas presentation, which I think is another solid sign for KOPN.

**I also believe that Kopin will partner with Apple.** Kopin has worked with Google Glass and Microsoft. Based on Patent filings, Apple has been exploring AR/VR for at least ten years. In January 2021, Dan Riccio, the former Apple Hardware Engineering Chief, transitioned to a new role overseeing Apple's work on developing an AR/VR headset. Apple is said to be working on multiple prototypes for AR/VR headsets, and is expected to first launch an ""Apple glasses"" product by 2022. Bloomberg has also reported that Apple plans to launch an AR headset similar to FaceBook's Oculus Quest. Kopin has a long history of research, product success, and high-level partnerships that I think would make it a great candidate to partner with Apple (if they haven't already, which I think it's likely that they have and it's just not public information). 

As u/madmattmen mentioned, KOPN has been a sleeping giant this past year. Their stock is up almost 2000% this past year, with huge accumulation occurring over the past few months alone. Their Earnings Report was set for 3/9, but they just moved it up a week to 3/2 which suggests good news (they are expected to report their strongest quarter yet). I am extremely bullish on KOPN, and I'm setting my price target at $20 by end-of-year.

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set to drop after S&amp;P 500′s best day since June

&gt; * U.S. stock futures dipped Tuesday after starting March with a broad rally. Shaking off the late February rough patch, the S&amp;P 500 on Monday gained 2.4% for its biggest one-day advance since June. Covid vaccine optimism and the 10-year Treasury yield off its one-year high spurred stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 603 points, or 2%. The Nasdaq, which shed 4.9% in last week’s tech sell-off, popped 3%. The Dow and Nasdaq had their best sessions since November.

*****

&gt; # 2. Target, Kohl’s quarterly results beat estimates

&gt; * Target on Tuesday exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, thanks to a strong holiday season and stimulus checks. Still, Target declined to provide a forecast for the year ahead, saying the pandemic has made it too difficult to predict consumer patterns. Target reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.67 per share on revenue of $28.34 billion, which jumped 21% year over year. Shares were little changed.

&gt; * Shares of Kohl’s rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the department store chain Tuesday delivered adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.22 per share, more than double estimates. Revenue of $5.88 billion, which fell 10% year over year, was slightly better than expectations. Kohl’s said it sees sales growth in 2021.

*****

&gt; # 3. Zoom Video shares surge after earnings, sales skyrocket

&gt; * Shares of Zoom Video Communications rose 8% in Tuesday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported adjusted fourth-quarter profit of $1.22 per share, crushing estimates by 43 cents. Revenue surged 369% year-over-year to $882.5 million, also beating forecasts. Zoom, which became all the rage during Covid, issued an upbeat current quarter forecast in anticipation of millions of people and businesses continuing to use its video-calling platform.

*****

&gt; # 4. Senate Democrats work on their version of Covid relief bill

&gt; * Democrats’ hopes of including a federal minimum wage increase in their $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill seemed all but dead, four days after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian said the chamber’s rules prohibited its inclusion. Senate Democrats hope to unveil their version of the House-passed package and begin debate as early as Wednesday. Congressional leaders want to send President Joe Biden the measure by March 14, when a federal jobless benefits boost, approved in December’s aid measure, is set to expire.

*****

&gt; # 5. Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduces a wealth tax

&gt; * Sen. Elizabeth Warren revived the idea of a wealth tax, which was central to her failed bid to become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also ran unsuccessfully for president last year advocating a wealth tax, is among the co-sponsors for the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act. The bill, unveiled Monday, proposes a 2% annual tax on wealth ranging from $50 million to $1 billion and a 3% annual tax on wealth over $1 billion.

lwc-wtang12,0.0,51.0,"What the title said. How is halting a stock, whether it is going up or down aggressively, not market manipulation? Is it really a free and open market if anyone (the exchanges) has the power to do this? It seems to me that there should be no central control of a ""free"" market and the right to cease trading should not be held by any party whatsoever.

It is everyone's personal responsibility to take on the risks of the market and that includes volatility. I feel like a lot of the time these things are done under the guise of what is ""in the best interest of retail investors"" but in reality, it does nothing but make them powerless to either buy or sell super volatile securities (get out or get in at their will). I didn't touch GME, AMC, or any of those wsb stocks with a ten-foot pole because I knew the risks, but just because some people didn't do their due diligence and may get burnt doesn't mean a stock should get halted. That is simply the nature of an open market, no?

If you don't want to experience such volatility then one should do their research and either not get involved in the stock market or not buy securities that are known to be volatile. Halting the market or the trading of any specific security is quite the opposite of a free and open capitalist marketplace. I don't buy any of the ""halts are used to make the market safer"" narrative. That is not a free and open marketplace then. Plain and simple.

nafizzaki,0.0,47.0,"There comes a point in any big selloff in Treasury bonds when the move becomes so pronounced that it starts to feed on itself. Increases in yields force a crucial group of investors to sell Treasuries, which in turn leads to further increases in yields. Two months into this rout, that moment appears to have arrived, and it’s beginning to send shudders throughout all corners of U.S. financial markets.

The forced sellers are investors in the $7 trillion mortgage-backed bond market. Their problem is that when Treasury yields -- which strongly influence home-loan rates -- suddenly rise sharply, many Americans lose interest in refinancing their old mortgages. A reduced stream of refinancings means mortgage-bond investors are left waiting for longer to collect payments on their investments. The longer the wait, the more financial pain they feel as they watch market rates climb higher without being able to take advantage of them. Their answer: unload the Treasury bonds they hold with long maturities or adjust derivatives positions -- a phenomenon known as convexity hedging -- to compensate for the unexpected jump in duration on their mortgage portfolios. The extra selling just as the market just as the market is already weakening has a history of exacerbating upward moves in Treasury yields -- including during major “convexity events” in 1994 and 2003.

This go around, the Federal Reserve’s massive presence in the mortgage-bond market -- it’s adding about $40 billion of the securities each month to its balance sheet -- has created something of a stabilizing force that has kept the market’s hedging needs in check. Even so, waves of mortgage investors adjusting their portfolios could still have an outsized impact on rates that reverberates across asset classes, market watchers say. “Everyone -- except the Fed -- is a convexity hedger at some point because as your portfolio keeps getting longer with the rise in rates it will become increasingly painful,” said Joshua Younger, head of U.S. interest-rate derivatives strategy at JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. “There’s more flexibility now for those who need to hedge so rates rising won’t cause the train to go off the rails. But even a train on the rails can be difficult to stop.”

Ten-year Treasury yields surged as much as 0.23 percentage point to a more than one year high of 1.61% Thursday before the selloff eased. Overall convexity hedging needs are likely at peak levels near the 1.6% area, Morgan Stanley strategist Guneet Dhingra wrote in a note to clients, potentially creating further upward pressure on yields in the middle of the Treasury curve. Five-year yields climbed even more than long-term rates, jumping as much as 0.26 percentage point to about 0.86% before paring their ascent. For Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho International, the spike in five-year rates is a warning signal that the selloff is going beyond a repricing, toward a convexity move, suggesting U.S. stocks and credit spreads will suffer further. The Nasdaq 100 fell as much as 3.7% Thursday, its biggest intraday drop since October. 

Read more: Treasury yields surge past 1.6%, sounding alarm for risk assets 

Still, few expect to see anything like what occurred in 2003, when convexity hedging helped fuel a roughly 1.5 percentage-point increase in 10-year Treasury yields over just two months, triggering widespread losses for bond investors. That’s because roughly a third of all mortgage-backed securities are now held by the Fed, which doesn’t hedge its duration risk, and another third by U.S. banks, which also largely don’t. Back in 2003, before the Fed started buying mortgage bonds to help stimulate the economy, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owned more than 20% of the market and were major convexity hedgers.

Nonetheless, there are enough mortgage-bond investors that do hedge to raise concerns just as yields threaten to become unmoored. Bank of America Corp. last week estimated there to be north of $60 billion of convexity hedging needs in terms of 10-year equivalents, the bulk coming from mortgage lenders, which must hedge their loan pipelines. The fact that investors are on high alert for mortgage-bond hedging effects despite being aware that non-hedgers now own the lion’s share of the debt should help ensure future portfolio adjustments are more “orderly” than in years past, according to Mahesh Swaminathan, a securitized-bond strategist at Hilltop Securities. “The focus now on this risk is positive for the marketplace and from a big-picture standpoint,” said Swaminathan. “This will prevent the situation of people being so far off sides that they have to make a sudden and huge adjustment. People are being vigilant about potential duration extension in the mortgage market.”


*My take:* while I don’t have any time machine, I don’t think this rise in yield will sustain as FED continues to abolish the free market. So, I think FED fund rates won’t rise and the yield in treasury will fall pretty quickly and we will have negative real interest rate in the future.

It logically follows that this is probably a good opportunity to buy the dip.

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record high close

&gt; * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.

&gt; * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.

&gt; * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay “patiently accommodative” to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is “a long way” from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.

*****

&gt; # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results

&gt; * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday’s closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.

&gt; * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber’s ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.

*****

&gt; # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop

&gt; * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray’s short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday’s premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.

*****

&gt; # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO

&gt; * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she’ll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That’s an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.

*****

&gt; # 5. House impeachment managers to continue their case against Trump

&gt; * House managers on Thursday are set to continue to lay out their case against former President Donald Trump at his second impeachment trial. Trump’s lawyers are expected to launch their defense by the end of the week. Chilling security video of last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, including scenes of rioters searching for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was introduced Wednesday as a key exhibit by Democratic lawmakers prosecuting the case for why Trump should be convicted of inciting the siege.

threeleggedgirl,0.0,46.0,"Okay, for the record, I'm a novice investor and don't really fully know what I'm doing.

I looked at my portfolio and.... It's bad. I realized some gains and flipped some money around and kept myself only 7% in the red. But I've got some holdings seriously deep in the red! Especially my Arks and QCLN. 

Being new I'm sure you know where this goes, lol. ""Do I sell before I lose all my money??"" I calmed myself down and reminded myself I have high risk investments but they're mostly ETFs and are very unlikely to hit zero as they're being managed by people far smarter than me who are far greedier than me. 

So I decided to read the news, not for answers but to just see if I notice any trends and red flags. And everything is just talking about a ""tech sell-off"" and a ""growth sell-off"" (which, duh?). But the interesting thing to me is there's really no discernable pattern. All they really got is ""Oh well Ford announced this so Tesla slipped, oh growth is down because growth is down."" On Reddit I've heard about retirement accounts being rearranged, I've heard of big industries shorting to drive price down, I've heard people think a reopen will be this and that, I've heard it's a correction because those markets were in a bubble...

But I don't know. Something just feels like hysteria here. The fact boomer stocks are going up proportionately to tech going down has me suspicious. If tech is in a bubble and crashing because the price wasn't justified, what the hell's justifying the relatively large rise in banking and oil etc right now?? So are we just moving the ""bubble"" into a new industry?

I feel like this could just be that boomers overgauged the impact our pandemic has been having on society over the last few months. I really don't think $BOA was somehow less valuable just because we had to wear masks, just to give an example. What world does tech suddenly lose value just because we can go to Pink Floyd cover band concerts with our grandchildren again, too? Better switch back to the good ol' reliables because we're going to shut off our phones and hug each other in a few months?

When people realized they jumped the gun buying in on old money stocks, aren't they just going to buy back the same tech stocks they had before? What industry could they possibly hop to next? 

Even considering politics, this shit is weird and nonsensical! Why would tech advancements, green energy, etc hit an all time high during a regressive presidential administration and then become irrelevant? It's like people forget Biden will be president still after his 100 days and that he's just going to spend 4 years vaccinating us and nominating people. I'm not a fan of the guy but but green energy has been his headlining issue and I have a feeling as soon as ""Green New Deal"" is a headline again, my $QCLN will skyrocket before anything is even passed as people rush to buy back in to renewables. 

Just wanted to verbalize all of this to see if anyone else feels the same way - like this is some dumb sham being led by stubborn short sightedness and good old fashion boomer ludditism (and of course boosted by big dogs in the industry, no doubt). I feel like April will hit and we'll see another V shape tech recovery like we did during the pandemic's start because people realized they're too stuck on their old ways that are probably never fully returning.",stocks,Tech sell-off seems short-sighted?,46.0,0.81

paq12x,0.0,48.0,"Guys

A lot of “experts” have been giving us advice on the rule of thumb in trading/investing etc.  I’ve been in the market long enough to honestly tell you that the only rule I follow is:  There is no rule.

If you’ve been in the market during the “lost decade” where the NASDAQ hit ATH then crashed and stayed down for a decade,  you’ll learn that it’s a lot easier to find 10 stocks that give you 1% gain than one stock that gives you 10% gain a month/week/day.  That’s the reality. 

There’s nothing wrong with FOMO – as long as you are realistic in your expectation.  Buying at the absolute peak is extremely rare.   If you bought GME at 300 and got out at 305 you are fine.   In fact, buying stock on the way up is the definition of momentum trading.  If you bought at the absolute peak then be thankful.  The fact that you were on your computer buying that stock may save your life – with that luck, a meteorite would have crashed on you if you walked out outside at that exact moment.

There’s nothing wrong with cutting loss early.  A single big loss can wipe out months of little gains.  If you are willing to take a loss that equals last week’s gain then that’s fine to sell there.   You may miss out if that was a temporary correction, but you could have saved weeks of gains you’ve accumulated if it was not.

The fact that you are putting money in the market (index ETFs are recommended by people smarter than I am) means you already on a winning track.  It takes a significant amount of hard work, dedication, and ass-kissing to get an extra 2%-3% raise in your salary (compared to the average salary raise).  It takes an extraordinary amount of effort to get 5%-10% on top of the average raise.  

The market is the same way.  It takes no work to get a 3-5% gain in the market a year.  It takes little work to match the SPY/VOO – just buy it.  It takes much more work to beat the SPY/VOO.  There’s no easy way out.   Either way, money in the market goes up quicker than your salary and that is the winning position.

I day trade mostly and here is where I am at:

Date / YTD realized gain

2-19 / 129,556 (last Friday)

2-22 / 133,738 (Monday)

2-23 / 145,436 (Tuesday)

2-24 / 145,591 (Wednesday)

2-25 / 149,100 (Thursday – last night)

2-26 / 152,696 (Friday) - End of a red week.

After a while, you will develop your own way of making money on red days/weeks/months.  I’ve learned more during the dot-com crash, the housing crash than the bull market following that.

I bought Nvidia, TSLA yesterday just before closing. I bought PLTR, HD, AAPL early this morning pre-market.  We’ll l see how that works out for me but so far I like the direction TSLA, Nvidia, PLTR, and HD moving up until 9:10 which is now.  

Keep in mind; I am not shooting for the stars.  I’ll get out of Nvidia the moment it goes above 560, for example, and will do the same with HD @ 260, etc.  If Nvidia doesn't get there quick enough and hover around 550,  I'll take that too.  What if HD stays at 257 for a while?  I'll cash out too.  There's no fixed rule, no fixed target - that's how I roll.

**We're going to make this text shorter soon** but for now please read the following from our mod u/TCGYT:

Over the past few weeks, /r/stocks has been inundated by posts about meme stocks.  These stocks, at certain times, offer/offered traders an opportunity to make quick gains far beyond the norm of normal investing.  When they take off, it can be tempting to wish to join the crowd – after all, nobody wants to be the one that sees their friend make 200% gains off of a company while your money “dithers” away in safe index funds or large established companies.  However, given recent events, it is important to note the risks of buying such stocks – while some make off with a great deal of money, others destroy their portfolios in ways that can take years to recover from, setting them back greatly.  Money is important in our society, and the allure of something that will get you rich quick – or the possibility that gains from such stocks can quickly change your life – can be incredibly enticing.  **Sometimes however, by the time you see the posts on here or other finance subreddits it is too late and the potential to lose money very real.**

Identifying what qualifies as a meme stock can be difficult.  In a way, all of us probably know one when we see one.  Let’s put it this way:  If you see a stock that is constantly being posted on reddit, twitter, or stocktwits, etc. without any true due diligence, and/or with questionable financials, then buying could put you at risk of financial setback.  Even if there is a solid investment thesis, seeing gains of over 100% in mere days or weeks is not normal market behavior, and could signal a correction is imminent on that security, that it has become a meme.

Meme stocks often come from some real catalyst – for example having Ryan Cohen join the GameStop board, or the Tilray merger – but quickly spiral out of control, becoming viral sensations in their own right that create risks for those that partake.

One of the problems with meme stocks is they will often come with manipulators and promoters who have a financial interest in you buying the stock, further bolstering their position.  When you read a post about a security, try to envision if the poster has a financial reason for what they are saying.  If they are linking to an outside website, or an app, or a YouTube channel, it is possible they are attempting to pump the security without merit for their own financial gain, or that their true interest lies not in the stock but in gaining you as a viewer/customer.  They may post something about a meme stock that appears on face value to be relevant news, but when you explore further contains links to their personal platforms.

Naturally, this isn’t always the case. But at all times, especially when considering meme stocks, it is important to be aware and ask yourself about the goals of the poster.

Manipulation is especially possible on penny stocks, those that normally trade under 5 dollars or with a market cap of under 300M. Given the sheer number of readers on these subreddits, forums like reddit or twitter can have an impact on the price of the stock in question. This is why we have long opted to ban discussions of penny stocks and [raised the bar with our rule 7 criteria](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/pennystocks) – the risk of manipulation is too great.

Everyone has the right to invest or trade how they see fit.  However, when attempting to pick a stock to buy there are certain considerations you can entertain to avoid the potential pitfalls of meme stocks.  Reading the SEC 10K or 10Q filings from a company can be a good place to start, as well as exploring the companies financials on sites like Yahoo Finance.  If you read DD from someone on reddit, consider whether you think they have given a full view of the company, or if they are merely cheerleading without looking at things like moats, competitors or possible downsides.  The devil is always in the details.

Forums like this can be powerful resources in doing ones research and crowdsourcing views on a stock, that may teach you new things about companies.  When things blow up to memes however, tread carefully.  There may be people who bought at a higher level trying to convince others to join the fray, or those who take advantage of the popularity to push their own platforms.  Choosing good stocks isn’t easy – if it were, we would all be millionaires.  Meme stocks are not always bad short-term plays.  But they carry with them greater risk of loss and manipulation that should be considered before any purchase order is made.",stocks,"r/Stocks Discuss Common Stocks Wednesday - Feb 17, 2021",50.0,0.93
Cultural_Dirt,0.0,47.0,"Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.

FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV companies. So what  gives?

After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite – something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.

# I.  The Team

First,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.

​

&amp;#x200B;

***The Allstars*** ***-***

**James (Jim) Taylor** – 35+ years experience – CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company’s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as “The Great One” when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim “The EV Man” Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.

**Jason Luo** – 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company’s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.

**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google’s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers’ new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called “High-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments”. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop – one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.

**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company’s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS’s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.

**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).

**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs – Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.

**David Boris –**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one company that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.

​

***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***

***Jerry Hu***  – 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**

***Justin Prann*** – 15+ years – CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.

***Kev Adjemian*** **–** 20+ years – CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**

***Albert Li*** – 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.

***Benjamin Wu***  – 15+ years – GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.

So  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent   connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other   places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.

# II. What Does ELMS Do?

Now  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:

▪First and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.

▪Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production

▪Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later

▪Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1

▪Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China

Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note – this is from December so it may have changed some since.

​

The  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.

A cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :

▪ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery

▪ One warranty single point of contact for customer

▪  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.

I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.

​

Next,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :

▪Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles

▪Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance

▪Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports

▪Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins

Some  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.

&amp;#x200B;

# III. Sales and Financials

The  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.

ELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.

The ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. “Our team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.”

I  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being “contingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.” As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.

​

​

**\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*

*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.

*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County – it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that “One-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.”  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated “Fairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.” Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.

​

Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state’s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company’s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.

Another  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, “Rivian’s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,” Taylor said.  “If you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That’s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \[U.S.  safety requirements\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. “Coming  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,” Taylor said.  “Supplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.”  Well, that's a  bargain.

The institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:

▪Alpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.

▪BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ▪Phoenix Holdings Ltd – 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)

▪Bank of America – 70k shares (\~$1mill)

▪Toronto Dominion Bank – 15k shares (\~$203k)

▪STA Wealth Management – 13k shares (\~$176k)

▪UBS Group – Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)

We also have in the past month:

▪Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.

▪P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.

▪Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.

▪Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.

I  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.

As  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.

Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :

▪No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches

▪Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022

▪Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market

▪Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025

# IV. The Indiana Factory

​

Another **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says “ELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.” The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.

Another  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production – workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.

In  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world’s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    “In addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering – from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  – and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,” said  James Taylor.

ELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs“ELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.”

Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.

# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection

Ok,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.

**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**

This  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors!

One thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding “bad reviews” from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.

Seres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.

**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**

Well,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.

# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?

The  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: “Is this a Chinese company or not?”

**The short and easy answer is NO.**

**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**

**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**

Sokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. “Hey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it’s  American,” he said. “Our  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    “You’ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I’d say  there’s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,” Taylor said. “But  after we’re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we’re like  everybody else. I’m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.”  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.

# VII. Technical Analysis

Had  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.

&amp;#x200B;

# VIII. Conclusion

If  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.

Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.

So I have landed a solid job in my career and finally have money to invest in. I’m going to be playing with stocks alittle, but I’m also planning to build a solid nest egg out of a long term index-based fund. After tons of research, I’ve narrowed down my top 3 to be (in order):

VTI (Vanguard Total Market)

IVV (iShares S&amp;P 500)

VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500)

My main criteria were low expense ratios (these are all at 0.03%), stability, and longevity. I like VTI more than VOO because VOO wasn’t started until 2010, so it’s lifetime yield isn’t a good comparison since it missed the 08-09 crash. VTI has slightly better gains than IVV over its lifetime, but IVV has had better short-term growth. IVV and VOO also had better dividend yields.

My brain is honestly fried going over all the numbers and I just want to know if it really matters all that much which of the three I choose. Is VTI a good investment over the other two? Is there a better long-term fund I haven’t listed? Any advice is welcome, I’m just trying to make the smart move.

Edit: I’ve gotten great advice so far, thank you very much, but people need to stop spamming Ark etfs. You clearly didn’t read the low expense ratio part.

On Tuesday as the market dipped, I took a leveraged CFD position in an index on Etoro, watched it climb to a profit, but as I prepared to sell, Etoro had a technical issue which kept me signed out for give or take an hour.

When it allowed me back into my account the trade was at a big loss, far below my stop loss. This was obviously worrying as the downside risk of my trade had increased a lot; but I still had faith in my decision and watched it climb back into a profit, before I had the chance to sell, Etoro had MORE technical issues, this time locking me out for the entire evening/morning.

When It allowed me back in my trade had been closed just hours before, when the market was well above my stop-loss level. I started emailing Etoro for help and they claim to have retroactively closed my position for the price that the stop-loss would have activated.

Key points:

1. The same technical issue that stopped me from selling in a profit, stopped their stop-loss from closing my trade
2. They closed my trade without my consent, and I did not receive even close to market value at the time of my trade being closed
3. If we are able to retroactively pick a point on a chart where I *should* have sold, but didn't due to ETOROs *technical issue* why at the point of maximum loss and not maximum gain (or at least where I tried and was signed out)?

I have tried to contact Etoro support, but they sent one canned response saying what they did, and have stopped answering.

I understand I entered a risky position, I am ok with the risk of losing due to the market, but it seems like Etoro made it impossible for me to do anything but lose the maximum amount here.

At current times, where the market is so crazy and unpredictable, I find myself in a pretty bizarre situation.

I see a lot of doom and gloom regarding what may be a coming market correction.  

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think the elites/wealthy only make money in up markets?

&amp;nbsp;

I understand if youre currently in a stock and its value has dipped quite a bit over the last few days/weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

That can be concerning. 

&amp;nbsp;

However, history has shown us that over the longer term, solid companies generally recover and continue to climb.  

&amp;nbsp;

If you do have any cash on the sidelines or are thinking about taking a loss and trying to recover in other plays, there are ""options"".

&amp;nbsp;

The time may be upon us when it makes more sense to sell short, buy puts and scalp for short term gains.

bro8619,0.0,47.0,"This is a time to learn, breathe, watch, and plan. Not a time to act...yet. One suggestion I offer to everyone, and it is something I do myself: I keep about 15% of my portfolio in BRKB at all times. I added tremendously in last year’s ~175 range, and have dealt with questioning and at times outright ridicule as to why I would sideline a significant portion of my portfolio when it has under performed the s&amp;p500 for the last 15 years.

I also keep 10-20% in VOO. Another 40% is spread out among ETFs, and the remainder home run swings. But I want to focus on precisely why Berkshire Hathaway is such a valuable investment vehicle so that many of you can consider it in the future.

Now is not the time to buy. Once all of this blows over and people are back to fetishizing growth, there may be some great entry opportunities. But it should not be looked at as purchasing an individual stock—instead you are buying a mindset toward diversifying amongst value assets. It’s insurance giant that diversifies on a time-tested philosophy and acts as insurance for your portfolio. Since I added back last year it’s up 40%+ and is carrying my portfolio through the turmoil. You don’t even have to own a lot to make it a winner. But when the market acts like this it really makes things easier psychologically.

There are concerns, of course. Warren isn’t going to live forever, and the company has been hesitant to capitalize on some major opportunities. But I imagine they may make some moves here that we will hear about later on if value presents itself. And the succession plan has been meticulously considered, just as Buffett’s investments are.

But anyway—plug for a company that is boring and overlooked, but run by guys who get this stuff better than all of us combined.

# Microsoft should acquire BlackBerry

TLDR: MSFT wants what GOOL and AAPL have – Android and iOS. Windows is shit. Buying BB makes MSFT instant dominant car OS vender.

# Software defined vehicle

Much like the evolution of cell phones. You used to buy new flip phones in order to get new features, now hardware and software on smart phones are updated separately. Vehicles are the next app platform. Vehicle software will be the next frontier for innovation. Every major player will want to sell you apps, services, and show you ads in your car. Unlike smart phones, Microsoft has not lost the battle in software defined vehicle space yet. The time for Microsoft to do something about it is now, and the fastest way to get a foot in the door is by acquiring BB. 

How much is each smart connected car worth to social media, ad platforms, cloud service platforms, etc.? A quick web search “social network value per user” says Facebook will generate $226 per user in the U.S. in 2021. Let’s say each U.S. driver is worth additional $50 to Facebook per year, $150 to all other social media and ad platforms combined. I’m being extremely conservative here; car users are captive audiences while phone users often are not. Users should worth more to social media companies when they’re in the car. The U.S. alone has over 270 million vehicles. That’s half a trillion total addressable market. That is just social media in the U.S., how about services and other apps we don’t know we need yet? All in, this can easily be a multi-trillion-dollar market. We haven’t even touched commercial vehicles and taxis yet.

# Microsoft needs a secure real-time OS that’s not Windows.

Microsoft and Ford’s Sync is an embarrassment to both Ford and Microsoft – source I bought my first and last Ford about 10 years ago. Ford kicked Microsoft to the curb in favor of QNX sometime ago. Ford is replacing QNX with Android from Google. Microsoft needs to redeem itself with Azure Cloud connected infotainment system running on a secure real-time OS. A proven secure platform is going to pitch well against Android and Linux based systems.

Apple has CarPlay and Google has Android Auto, and Microsoft is practically absent in infotainment space. CarPlay and most instances of Android Auto runs on QNX based systems. More specifically they rely on QNX’s Projection system. Basically, the apps run on your phone, and “project” the display via QNX and QNX sends control signals (touch screen, button press, etc.) to the phone app. If you’re huge company who wants a piece of the car software pie, but no one uses your Windows phone, what can you do? You can bundle your software with the car! Build it into the car’s OS, for free! 

Microsoft would love to pull another Internet Explorer vs Netscape Navigator if they can control the car OS. Only in this case Apple and Google are not the underdog Netscape was. Apple and Tesla will do their own thing, but for the majority of auto makers who already use QNX, the easy thing to do is keep using QNX if it is good enough and backed by MSFT’s engineering power. A MSFT own QNX can even be free or less than free.

# Monolithic Kernel vs Micro Kernel

Microsoft Windows is not suitable for cars, and it can’t be fixed. BlackBarry’s QNX Neutrino RTOS, based on microkernel architecture, is inherently more secure than monolithic kernel such as Linux. Microsoft Windows has hybrid kernel and by some measures has worse security track record. When your email, IM, and text can be shown on your car’s screen or read aloud via your car’s audio system. Security will be a major concern for consumers and government agencies. Microsoft owned QNX has a real chance of dominating Android and upcoming Apple Car OS.

# Conclusion

I see increasing chatter about MSFT may benefit from a BB acquisition so I did some DD before start buying BB stock. I believe after MSFT lost the smart phone battle, car software and OS are MSFT’s once in a generation second chance. BB enterprise value is about 6 billion. I can see MSFT spend 20+ billion in stock and cash to buy BB. I write code for a living and thinks he understands markets he has little to no knowledge of. I’m not a financial advisor. I spent a lot of my time on GitHub and various programming chatrooms. I may have read something on the web that give me this idea, or it may be all in my head. I honestly can’t tell. I do not have any direct or indirect knowledges pertinent to MSFT and BB’s technical or management decisions. Invest at your own risk.

The other day I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrk8uv/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/) with my product/customer analysis on Roblox using my thoughts and knowledge having dealt with the platform since its early days. I believe my insight was important as it gave information and understanding about the platform from a perspective that can't be found in any traditional analysis. If you plan to read this post and haven’t read that one already, I encourage you start there. I don't expect any grown adult to engage with the product themselves to do their own DD (unless they play with their kids or something like that).

The post blew up both here and on the [identical thread in r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/), more than I was expecting them to. A lot of good points and discussion was had, and as such, I feel the need to follow up with some more information. I was able to simply edit the r/investing thread, however, one of the links I edited with on r/stocks was disallowed and the post was deleted. So, here's my part 2 with the information you guys missed from the other thread's edits.

A lot of people asked how I could conclude a large percentage of Roblox's player base is bots that prey on kid's accounts or inactive users.  That is more of an anecdote than something you can back up with hard numbers and data, because it’s obviously not something Roblox tracks itself. Every group and comments section on Roblox is plagued by bots spamming fishy links that take you to places for “free Robux” and such. There’s a game on Roblox called New User Machine that tracks the total amount of players and shows the most recently created ones. Basically, it’s a conveyer belt of bots with random letter &amp; number usernames. I took that info, compared the total player base to the active one, and made my conclusion that their security and captcha are lacklustre. Their registered user count of **2.4 billion** is not impressive when compared with the daily active user (DAU) count of around **30 million**.

Moving on to the financial side...

[Here is Roblox's S-1 form.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) I want to specifically focus on a few sections:

&gt;***We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.***  
&gt;  
&gt;We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future. We incurred net losses of $97.2 million, $86.0 million, and $203.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $484.0 million. We also expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in future periods, and **if our** **DAU growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability**. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make significant investments to grow our business. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. If we fail to increase our revenue to sufficiently offset the increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

Roblox is currently relying upon their Daily Active Users (DAU) to increase past their record all-time high to achieve profitability after a history of net loss. This record was achieved mostly likely due to the current pandemic keeping kids locked inside. They touch on this here:

&gt;***We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.***  
&gt;  
&gt;We have experienced rapid growth in the three months ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and for a portion of the three months ended March 31, 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, our bookings increased 171% from the nine-months ended September 30, 2019 to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods (i.e. the three months ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020). Our historical revenue, bookings and user base growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We believe our overall acceptance, revenue growth and increases in bookings depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:  
&gt;  
&gt;• **expand the number of developers, creators, and users on our platform;**  
&gt;  
&gt;• **provide excellent customer experience and customer support for our developers, creators, and users;**  
&gt;  
&gt;**• increase global awareness of our brand.**

The bolded bullet points here tie in directly with points I have mentioned in my original post, along with this section here:

&gt;***We depend on our developers to create digital content that our users find compelling, and our business will suffer if we are unable to entertain our users, improve the experience of our users, or properly incentivize our developers and creators to develop content.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Our platform enables our developers to create experiences and virtual items, which we refer to as user generated content. Our platform relies on our developers to create experiences and virtual items on our platform for our users to acquire and/or use. Our users interact with these experiences, which are largely **free** to engage with.

Largely free to engage with - this echoes my previous sentiment in which few players are really seen spending money on this game, at least compared to the amount who don't.

So, all that being said, where do we stand currently?

* Roblox has developers bringing in millions of dollars, with one of them reportedly bringing in $50 million as of 2020.
   * Another thing to note here that I thought was funny was the President mentioning his Roblox account being a company goal. Ambitious, or last-ditch effort at marketing?
   * This information is taken from the [2020 Roblox Developer's Conference.](https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/)
* Roblox has an Amazon store selling merchandise and toys, the latter of which are also available in stores worldwide.
   * The link to this is available in the [r/investing thread's 1st edit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/)
* Roblox runs its own data centers to deliver its platform.
   * For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, direct infrastructure costs were $58.2 million, or 13% of bookings, and grew by 66% to $96.8 million, or 8% of bookings, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
      * This data is taken from the S-1 form.

So, it's clear that the company is well cemented and has elements that should signify growth, but it's still unclear why such significant investment and presence in the online video game market has not yet translated to profit. This makes it difficult for me to make a bull case for $RBLX. The DPO on March 10th is expected to be around $45. Had this offering been in the single digits or teens, I believe a great long value play could've been made. For me, $45 is a bit too rich for my blood for a company that is hinging on continued growth past the pandemic and a lot of other things going right that should have already happened in the last 16 years that they have been in business.

Moving on...

[This comment chain from the r/investing thread is a great read and offers the developer insight I was looking for in the original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/gooabb3/?context=3) A lot of Roblox's viability for future growth hinges on continuing to grow as a game engine &amp; platform rather than just a social platform for kids that happens to have games. Here are my thoughts on that, as things stand now.

For Roblox to be taken more seriously as a game engine, like Unity or Unreal, they need to continue to rebrand and move past the image of ""kid's Lego game/Minecraft alternative"", which will consume even more capital than they're already investing, not to mention the costs of simply going public. Their VC funding last year leading to their 30M valuation is 7x bigger than the funding of the previous year. Whether that symbolizes huge future growth or dumping the company on retail investors as a backup is up to your belief in the company.

The game engine uses Lua, and it has improved a lot in the past years. There are some images showing what's possible on the [r/investing thread's 1st edit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/) Looks great, right? Yes, but their target demographic doesn't have cutting-edge PCs that can run those graphics. From their S1:

&gt;68% of our engagement hours on the platform were from users who signed up through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

These kids play on tablets, not supercomputers. That being said, any game developed in Roblox needs to work with the economy of the website. Unity and Unreal don't suffer from this, because they were never a social platform for kids. Whether or not that is a limiting factor to growth depends on the games developers want to make. You must also keep in mind that whatever is developed on Roblox needs to be gobbled up by an age group that is predominantly under 13. From their S1:

&gt;For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 54% of our users were under the age of 13.

A lot of accounts could have fake birthdays, lending further to the idea of a young player base. As a result, complex games with cutting-edge industry tech isn't the cash cow here. This means that all the money invested in improving the platform might not result in tangible returns. Furthermore, the most popular games are cash grab ""simulators"" and carbon copies of games that already exist, sometimes with stolen assets. That presents a copyright problem if Roblox is to continue expanding.

If you got this far, thanks for reading, and best of luck in your future investments.

**TL;DR**: No TL;DR. This is not WSB where I feed you positions to take or hype up a stock so we can all win/lose money.

Well, it seems like there’s a good bit of interest in the Roblox public listing, so I figured we should touch on some highlights. For those not aware, the MMORPG will be issuing a direct public listing “on or about” March 10, according to a recent filing.

**Key Points:**

Class A Shares: 196M

Valuation: $29.5B

Estimated cost/share: $45

Ticker: RBLX

[S-1 Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

**Business Model:**

Roblox serves as an engine and platform, and allows individual creators to design and launch games. Players can sort through thousands of different games, and play with and against other users online, or in private groups. Users purchase in game currency, Robux, with real world money, and can in turn use that for in game purchases ranging from game-mode specific items to clothing and accessories for their lego-like avatar. Creators are paid by Roblox with Robux, which can then be converted back into real-world currency.

**Users:**

Ask any parent, teacher, or other individual who deals with teenage and younger children, and I can all but guarantee they can speak at length on Roblox. The game has seen massive appeal with children, growing to a high of 164M Daily Active Users (DAU). Per the company’s S-1, age breakdown is as follows: Under 9, 25%; 9-12, 29%; 13-16, 13%; 17-24, 16%, 25+, 14%. With over half of all users under 12, Roblox has understandably been subject to concerns ranging from chat moderation to customer retention.

It’s worth noting here that 67% of DAUs come from outside of the US and Canada, but 68% of bookings (revenue) came from within the two countries.

**Finances:**

The topic around which success or failure hangs. I will start with the caveat that Roblox has stated it is prioritizing increasing payouts to content creators in an attempt to incentivize them to stay on platform. They are also making significant investments in infrastructure, “to ensure that our growing user and developer base can access and can use the Roblox Platform.”

For the 9 months ended September 30 (data up to S-1 filing), Roblox saw $588.675M in revenue. Cost of revenue, including R&amp;D, marketing, administrative, and infrastructure totaled roughly $585M. Developer exchange fees, or simply the payouts to their independent content creators totaled $209M. All together, the company saw a net loss of $206.234M. The company currently has $193M in working capital, and $1.5B in total assets.

As shown above, the company loses money, and projects it will continue to lose money in the near future. Aggressive payouts to content creators and updating infrastructure make up the bulk of its expenses. The company also invests heavily in next-gen R&amp;D, including fully immersive VR compatibility, through Oculus, Valve, and others.

**Other stuff:**

As has been pointed out, the company may face issues regarding content violation the IP of other companies. Thus far, this has not been an issue pressed, but certainly something worth monitoring. The younger user base also understandably leads to issues regarding content moderation, and creating a safe environment for children.

**Subjective views:**

I don’t like injecting my own views in a DD, but I just wanted to touch on some things I didn’t know where to categorize. I would love to see Roblox continue to capture markets beyond North America, and especially Asia and Europe. They have high user retention, and were the 3rd highest grossing game of 2020, falling only to Tencent’s PUBG and Honor of Kings. I would also love to see them add a learning based angle to capitalize on the social appeal of the platform.

For me, the $30B valuation isn’t terribly off base, if, and only if, it can continue to grow and retain users. While they remain cash flow negative, I’m less concerned about this than when I originally looked at the company. Infrastructure, R&amp;D, and many of the administrative expenses could be reduced in theory if it became a serious issue. The goal Roblox should be focusing on, in my opinion, is 1) expanding its platform to Playstation and Nintendo, and 2) increasing its age 20+ users. If it succeeds in these two areas, it should have no issue meeting revenue demands.

Ultimately, Roblox has a model to exert staying power over its users. The company will need to continue to rely on content creators to drive value, in much a similar way that YouTube does with its platform. While Roblox is approaching 20 years in the market, it is still very much in its infancy with its potential. With the overwhelming majority of users under 18, it is my hope that as its users grow up, so to does the platform itself, and begins to transition into a company with broad market appeal to young adults and the financial majority of gamers.

Personally, I’m probably going to sit out its release. For those of you with kids, and those who have been waiting for this release, I don’t think this will be an investment you end up regretting. But for me, the valuation stretches to the high version of where I myself have them valued, and I will need to see either more growth in the older markets, or a transition into cash flow positive for this to fit into my portfolio. Should this see a dip at all, I will look to enter, but I just don’t see it happening. I wish all of you prospective investors the best of luck, and sincerely hope you all come back in a year to flaunt your wealth over the sideline spectators like me.",stocks,Back for more with a mini DD on Roblox,45.0,0.94

discodropper,0.0,43.0,"Edit: ‘fair value’ is probably the wrong term. ‘Target price’ is probably more accurate. TLDR: how do you arrive at a target price?

So I’m trying to learn how to get better at DD, and I’m hitting a bit of a snag, namely how to calculate the ~~‘fair value’~~ *target price* of a stock. 

Most of my analysis in the past has been pretty hand-wavy, e.g. Green Energy = the future, duh, so one stock green energy company please! Most of my bets have paid off handsomely, but the recent downturn in green energy/EVs/ biotech has forced me to question what a “reasonable” share price is for a company. Obviously there’s a bit of a guessing game here, but it seems like one could arrive at a ballpark ~~‘fair’~~ *target* value based on the size of the market, the company’s dominance within that market, and the market’s/company’s growth potentials. Those values, relative to the market cap, should allow for a back-of-the envelope guesstimate of ~~fair~~ *target* stock price. So my question is, is there a relatively straightforward relationship here? 

As a example, here’s [a recent report about the augmented reality market and its growth potential](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/augmented-reality-market), and here are some values mentioned  in it:

- Market size value in 2021 = USD 26.75 billion
- Revenue forecast in 2028 = USD 340.16 billion
- Growth Rate = CAGR of 43.8% (2021 to 2028)

Now let’s say I’m looking at KOPN, which makes wearable AR devices like Google glasses, displays in fighter pilot helmets, and AR-enabled displays for surgeons. They currently have a market cap of $860M, with a share price of ~$10. Is this currently overvalued (has the potential growth already been “priced into” the current share price, as the cool kids like to say), or is it still undervalued and now is a good time to stock up on shares?

**We're going to make this text shorter soon** but for now please read the following from our mod u/TCGYT:

-----

Over the past few weeks, /r/stocks has been inundated by posts about meme stocks.  These stocks, at certain times, offer/offered traders an opportunity to make quick gains far beyond the norm of normal investing.  When they take off, it can be tempting to wish to join the crowd – after all, nobody wants to be the one that sees their friend make 200% gains off of a company while your money “dithers” away in safe index funds or large established companies.  However, given recent events, it is important to note the risks of buying such stocks – while some make off with a great deal of money, others destroy their portfolios in ways that can take years to recover from, setting them back greatly.  Money is important in our society, and the allure of something that will get you rich quick – or the possibility that gains from such stocks can quickly change your life – can be incredibly enticing.  **Sometimes however, by the time you see the posts on here or other finance subreddits it is too late and the potential to lose money very real.**

Identifying what qualifies as a meme stock can be difficult.  In a way, all of us probably know one when we see one.  Let’s put it this way:  If you see a stock that is constantly being posted on reddit, twitter, or stocktwits, etc. without any true due diligence, and/or with questionable financials, then buying could put you at risk of financial setback.  Even if there is a solid investment thesis, seeing gains of over 100% in mere days or weeks is not normal market behavior, and could signal a correction is imminent on that security, that it has become a meme.

Meme stocks often come from some real catalyst – for example having Ryan Cohen join the GameStop board, or the Tilray merger – but quickly spiral out of control, becoming viral sensations in their own right that create risks for those that partake.

One of the problems with meme stocks is they will often come with manipulators and promoters who have a financial interest in you buying the stock, further bolstering their position.  When you read a post about a security, try to envision if the poster has a financial reason for what they are saying.  If they are linking to an outside website, or an app, or a YouTube channel, it is possible they are attempting to pump the security without merit for their own financial gain, or that their true interest lies not in the stock but in gaining you as a viewer/customer.  They may post something about a meme stock that appears on face value to be relevant news, but when you explore further contains links to their personal platforms.

Naturally, this isn’t always the case. But at all times, especially when considering meme stocks, it is important to be aware and ask yourself about the goals of the poster.

Manipulation is especially possible on penny stocks, those that normally trade under 5 dollars or with a market cap of under 300M. Given the sheer number of readers on these subreddits, forums like reddit or twitter can have an impact on the price of the stock in question. This is why we have long opted to ban discussions of penny stocks and [raised the bar with our rule 7 criteria](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/pennystocks) – the risk of manipulation is too great.

Everyone has the right to invest or trade how they see fit.  However, when attempting to pick a stock to buy there are certain considerations you can entertain to avoid the potential pitfalls of meme stocks.  Reading the SEC 10K or 10Q filings from a company can be a good place to start, as well as exploring the companies financials on sites like Yahoo Finance.  If you read DD from someone on reddit, consider whether you think they have given a full view of the company, or if they are merely cheerleading without looking at things like moats, competitors or possible downsides.  The devil is always in the details.

Forums like this can be powerful resources in doing ones research and crowdsourcing views on a stock, that may teach you new things about companies.  When things blow up to memes however, tread carefully.  There may be people who bought at a higher level trying to convince others to join the fray, or those who take advantage of the popularity to push their own platforms.  Choosing good stocks isn’t easy – if it were, we would all be millionaires.  Meme stocks are not always bad short-term plays.  But they carry with them greater risk of loss and manipulation that should be considered before any purchase order is made.",stocks,"r/Stocks Discuss Common Stocks Tuesday - Feb 16, 2021",43.0,0.91

I’ve been eyeing MSFT for a long time and hate myself for not buying when it was around 130.

My feeling was it’s undervalued and they have a lot of good revenue streams especially after their cloud business has been taking off.

Furthermore, I feel they have learned their lesson with regards to monopoly practices and would be less likely to get enforcement action taken on them vs some of the other big tech names.

ThisIsBartRick,0.0,47.0,"## Introduction

Macerich is a REIT that specialize in shopping centers (you know, that thing that you don't go to anymore because of Amazon and the pandemic).

The company has performed very poorly company wise (occupancy dropped to 89.8% in 2020 from 95.4% in 2018) and in stock price (it dropped from $90 in July 2016 to $6 in April 2020 and is now at $12.90).

There are a few worrying things about this company. So let's go through them one by one and see how bad they are.

## Their debt

They've increased their debt (from 54.5% in 2018 to 66.4% in 2019 to a whopping 83.5% of their market cap in end 2020). Leverage like that on shopping centers (you know that thing you don't go to anymore because of amazon and the pandemic) could be ok : they don't really care about the declining revenue of those shopping centers, they just need them to pay their leases. But 2 things are pretty worrisome : i) some retail stores might go bankrupt and ii) Macerich is using $1.5bn of their line of credit.

To counteract that : The bankruptcy issue for retail stores is not that big of a deal for Macerich  and they have a (good) plan if they have to repurpose a shopping mall (both explained below). And for the line of credit thingy, their unencumbered assets (an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims or liens) are sufficient enough to cover their $1.5bn in line of credit if it's needed. They can also dilute the shares to raise more capital. They've also filed for an ATM offering for up to $500 million.

## Occupancy / Rent collection 

Their occupancy is at 89.7	% (for the shopping centers that are not under development nor redevelopment). This is down from the 95.4% it was at in 2018 or the 94% in 2019.

The good news however is that ""*rent collections, for example, during April and May were 35%, that grew to 80% in the third quarter. And as of today, the fourth quarter rent collections were at 92% and rising by the week.*"" said Tom O'Hern, CEO of Macerich in their recent Earnings call.


## The declining trend of brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in general

That's a big one and this has been a much bigger trend as the pandemic forced some people to buy things online. This trend is also not new at all as [this Vox article shows very well](https://www.vox.com/recode/21561046/death-rebirth-department-stores-retail-charts).

But the silver lining is that as some retail stores are going bankrupt, the big shopping centers are getting stronger from having less competition. And since Macerich has mostly big shopping centers, that's pretty good for them.

## What about the bankrupt stores in the near future

Green Street Advisors expects ""about a little more than half of all mall-based department stores to close by the end of 2021.""

That can be a big problem but  they seem to be prepared for it. They're planning on doing some mixed-use development and I like it. Doug said in their most recent earnings call :

&gt; However, we know our shoppers want more than just traditional retail. And that's why we continue to focus on bringing alternative uses to our campuses and not just retail. Uses like office, residential, hospitality, medical, wellness, education, fitness, grocery, service and even storage, and that's why we continue to refer to our properties as town centers because that's what they're becoming. They're transformational and will be something for everyone. And they have to be because that's what our modern-day shopper wants.

What makes me even more optimistic is that most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). Those are very high density locations which are the most promising places for redevelopment or for mixed-use purposes.

## The repurpose of their buildings 

That's great to know that they're *planning* on ""bringing alternative uses to [their] campuses"" but how faisible is it and how much will that help them?

First, let's see what Macerich could convert its buildings to :

- Offices but there's a lot of uncertainty in this area. We're in the middle of a big shift in this regard which might benefit them or not.
- Other retail stores but jesus christ this market is not doing good right now and has not been doing well years before the pandemic.
- Industrial complexes like warehouses are booming right now thanks to e-commerce and the pandemic. This looks really promising if they go down that road but they need to do this quickly and strategically as all locations are not necessarily interesting. 
- Housing which a lot of real estate have mixed feelings about.

Or Macerich could do another interesting thing : mixed-use development. 

&gt; It is a type of urban development, urban planning and/or a zoning type that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses into one space, where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections.

Most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). So let's evaluate their possibilities in those locations that they've invested in. 

**California**

Let's start with California and use [the Allen Matkins/UCLA Anderson 2021 winter forecast](https://www.allenmatkins.com/anderson-forecast/allen-matkins-ucla-anderson-forecast-california-cre-survey.html). They've polled a lot of real estate professionals in California and here are the results :

They're pretty pessimistic about offices ROI today but they're confident that demand will increase. HOWEVER, ""*the panelists believe that newly built space, in addition to that freed by companies reducing their existing space, will outstrip any near-term increased demand for office space*"". Outch! Right in the feels!

Ok so not offices how about retail spaces? That one is short : ""*62% of panelists indicated that they will not develop any new properties in the coming 12 months*"".

Also :

&gt; Overall, the level of new retail property construction is expected to significantly decline from 2020 through 2023; and some existing space, lacking sufficient demand, will be converted to other uses.

However, for the industrial space market, they're really optimistic : ""*approximately 30 percent of the panelists stated that the experience of the recession has caused them to consider increasing the amount of development they will undertake.*"".

They're also expecting that the housing market will grow steadily when the economy rebounds.

So I'm pretty optimistic for California if they need to repurpose their buildings : they could turn those spaces into housing or warehouses/industrial complexes or in mixed-use schemes.

And how about Ney York??

**New York**

Well... The short-term outlook is not that pretty!

In end of July 2020, Metro Manhattan reports that [Office sales have dropped 58%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-new-york-city-office-sales-drop-58-during-lockdown/) and [retail sales activity dropped 78%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-retail-sales-activity-drops-78-during-nyc-lockdown/) during the lockdown.

[Also](https://therealdeal.com/2020/10/19/new-yorks-cre-woes-could-spread-nationwide-investors/) :

&gt; Citing Trepp, the Journal reported that more than $3 billion worth of loans backing commercial property in the five boroughs are delinquent, and loans in creditor negotiations amount to an additional $4 billion.

Finally, a lot of people are leaving the city because i) it's the epicenter of the pandemic and ii) it's a very dense city that was attractive because most of the activity is there. Now that people can work from home, they're no longer trapped in the city and [110,00 people left during the lockdown as a result](https://www.mymove.com/moving/covid-19/coronavirus-moving-trends/).

So all of this hurts offices, housing market and retail stores (because less people means less sales) *in the short term*.

For the long term, long story short, that's going to be the same as California but they will need to repurpose a lot more buildings as the situation is much worse in New York.

**An the rest of the commercial real estate though?**

There's [a nice report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/commercial-real-estate-outlook.html) by Deloitte. The key messages summarize it well but I encourage you to read the whole thing as this is pretty interesting not only for Macerich but for all REIT investing in shopping centers in the US.

## Conclusion

Macerich is pretty undervalued right now with a maket cap close to $2bn. It's pretty understandable because of the situation it is in right now : their debt is pretty important and commercial real estate is in terrible state right now in general. But their finances getting better as of end 2020, their occupancy approaching 90%, their interesting plans for unoccupied stores and the promising long-term outlook in California and New York (the 2 locations they're mostly invested in) shows a very good upside while the downside seems to be already priced in.",stocks,Long DD on Macerich ($MAC),47.0,0.93
as96,0.0,43.0,"Before you start this is not a DD, I haven't gone through financials, it's more of an overall opinion coming from a computer enthusiast on why I think Intel could be interesting and it's worth adding on a watchlist.

I'm posting this so I can get opinions from you guys about what I'm right or wrong about.

And for **full disclosure** even though I don't think it's relevant due to the size I'm gonna mention it anyway: **I do technically own some INTC** but it's only **2 shares**, [yes 2 shares](https://imgur.com/a/vv3Yi6k).

So as of now while I may add a position in the future, this could go to zero or do a 100x and it wouldn't really affect me or my judgment in anyway. I may actually get a real position on Intel but as of now I'm just keeping it on my watchlist, I want to see how the new CEO is gonna handle it first.

\-----------------------------------

# Cons

Before we talk about the pros of Intel I really think we should discuss the cons, since INTC has many, I’m gonna list them first then address each one:

\- Management

\- Production issues

\- Competitors

\- The x86 architecture is getting old

# Management

I think we can all agree management has been a hit or miss at best, while AMD managed to take a company with uncompetitive products to leading player. In the meanwhile Intel has managed to go from its dominant position to a… well… pretentious follower that doesn’t even care its products are being laughed at by enthusiasts.

It’s technically not a complete failure, they did manage to milk the dying cow well enough to grow revenues consistently but this approach couldn’t have kept it alive much longer.

# Production issues

Intel has been stubbornly avoiding outsourcing, which is good in theory sadly this didn’t go as planned and they still didn’t scrap the idea as a failure, it just caused delay after delay on products they  absolutely needed to stay competitive.

# Competitors

If you are thinking AMD, you are wrong, they kept going in alternating cycles forever thinking their duopoly wouldn’t be challenged, the time has finally come.

Apple, while not an actual competitor has shown that what has kept the two companies on top is starting to get less competitive and it’s not the only viable solution for the desktop market anymore. Apple may have just scratched them but now the blood is in the water and the sharks are smelling that.

# The x86 architecture is getting old

We have finally arrived to the real threat to Intel survival, their beloved x86 architecture, licensed only to their frenemy AMD.

The crown jewel of Intel is not enough anymore, Moore’s law for Intel does not apply anymore but it does for ARM.

I think it’s important to understand the main difference between x86 and ARM, this is a battle between CISC and RISC. I don’t want to go into the details since things can get complex so let’s make it quick and simple: x86 is a CISC architecture meaning on each chip they pack a lot of instructions so that if you want to perform an operation you need less cycles. ARM approach is different though, ARM is a RISC architecture meaning the chips only contain the strictly necessary and basic instructions, in this case to perform one operation you may need to use more instructions and cycles however it has one big benefit: the chips are much more simple, less complexity = easier production.

ARM requires a lot less power to work and by consequence less heat is required to be dissipated this little detail is what makes a chip with less instructions faster than a chip with more instructions, yes, you may need to use more cycles for your operations but you are able to make the chips run at higher speeds and pack a LOT more cores.

# Pros

Finally! We’ve reached the pros, again like the cons I’m gonna list them first, and, you may notice something interesting about them:

\- Management

\- Brand

\- Production issues

\- Competitors

\- Architecture &amp; support

Yes, they are almost the same, Intel is a weird beast in a fairly complex environment

# Management

Not much to say here, #1 problem of Intel has finally been addressed, the CEO is about to be replaced, Swan was a CFO placed into a CEO position, you may be the best CFO of this world but you can’t drive a company like this looking at the checkbooks.

Gelsinger is coming in and his background is pretty promising, like I did in school I’m gonna steal this next section from Wikipedia (thank you Wikipedia):

&gt;He previously served as CEO of [VMware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware) for a decade, and as president and chief operating officer at [EMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMC_Corporation). Before joining EMC, he was the first Chief Technology Officer of [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel), previously senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel, before leaving after working there for more than three decades.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-:0-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-3)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Gelsinger was the architect of the original [Intel 80486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486) processor.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-:0-2) As CTO of Intel he also launched the conference [Intel Developer Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Developer_Forum) as a counterpart to [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)'s [WinHEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Hardware_Engineering_Conference). In September 2009, he left Intel to join EMC.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-5)  
&gt;  
&gt;In late 2012 some industry analysts named Gelsinger as a possible successor to [Steve Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer) as CEO of [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-8)  
&gt;  
&gt;[Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) announced the appointment of Gelsinger as their new CEO on January 13, 2021, effective February 15.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-9)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-wsj1-1) A letter sent from shareholder and activist investor Dan Loeb of [Third Point Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Point_Management) to the board calling on Intel to hire an investment adviser to recuperate the company's lagging market share came before Gelsinger's return.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger#cite_note-:0-2)

And he’s not coming alone, a couple of skilled veterans are coming with him.

It’s still too early to judge how this will go, and things will need a few years to play out, R&amp;D does take time, even Su didn’t save AMD in one day.

# Brand

While it has fallen out of favor many still prefer to buy Intel just based on the Brand alone.

# Production issues

Let’s not beat it around the bush to much, Intel should’ve outsourced production, however IF they could get everything to work properly the pay out will be insanely useful, especially in moments like these, just take a look at TSMC, it just can’t keep up with the demand.

This move can be smart, making your own staff just like Apple has proven comes with nice benefits.

I still think Intel needs to outsource while they keep developing their internal pipeline though.

# Competitors

This is tricky, I don’t think it’s actually a pro per se but I’m gonna put it here anyway.

AMD is not really a threat to Intel survival, they want to be dominant but they don’t want to go for the kill.

With the M1 Apple SoCs though ARM chipmakers are smelling blood, however Intel has still time to catch up, the M1 is a great but it really needs macOS to shine, Windows is still not there yet on ARM support.

# Architecture &amp; Support

Yes, x86 is showing its age, but is still the only architecture with decent support on Windows, which let’s not forget has basically a monopoly and old software still requires x86 compatibility, Windows emulation of x86 is not up to par with Apple’s

So, while old x86 still has the edge, for now.

BUT I do NOT think x86 is the future, ARM is already a successful, valid and objectively better solution for scalability. Unlike x86 ARM licenses are available with anyone who wants to pay for them so Intel can actually join the game on this.

There is also another road, RISC-V, it’s showing promising results and it’s open source.

Anyone can take RISC-V and develop it without paying any fee.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

theepicone111,0.0,40.0,"I’m young (19). I have no debt to pay for at least 4 years. After that I will likely have a decent paid job and I will be stuck in the eat, sleep, work, pay tax, pay debt cycle. 
I’ve saved up 10k. At the moment I’ve put 2k in apple, 1k in index etfs, 1.5k in ARK, 1k in NIO. 0.5k in PLTR.  I plan to keep on investing any more money that comes in. That leaves me 4k (which I’m willing to risk for high returns)
I’m looking to grow this as much as possible within 4 years to reduce my student debt. Now yes, I know time in the market beats timing the market. But the stock market has become a hobby of mine. I look forward to the market opening every day - whether it’s up or down. I’m always looking for opportunities. 
As of now, the majority of my money is invested in relatively safe equities. With the rest I really want to 2/3x my money. Being in the UK, I can do spreads - massive potential for gains and losses. I was thinking of doing spreads but in a swing trade kind of time frame. I would go big, but only on a decent dip on a well structured, stable stock (keeping a safe margin of course). I have made my fair share of mistakes with spreads, ranging from taking oversized bets on meme stocks, to cutting my losses early on stable stocks only for them to rocket to all time highs instantly after. 

Im just a little unsure on deciding between spreads or swing trading by buying actual shares. Spreads allows me to choose my potential gains and losses based on my risk. I would only have to deposit a fraction of the actual underlying stock price. It’s also tax free (though that doesn’t affect me right now). 
What would the benefits of swing trades be compared to spreads? At the moment I don’t see any, other than the tiny amount in dividends I may get. With just 4k I wouldn’t be able to make many trades at all and the shares I buy would need to be growth stocks to make a decent return. 

Am I going about this the right way? Assuming my risk management is good, would spreads be the way to go?",stocks,Aggressive investing / trading,40.0,0.87
Cashmere_Cowboy,0.0,42.0,"Not sure how many of you are following whats going on in container and bulk shipping...? But, it may be worth your attention as they are going from strength to strength.

For those of you that haven't been keeping an eye, container rates have gone through the roof due to a bottleneck in the container market met with increased demand for consumer goods during the pandemic (ie. containers are logjam and can't keep pace with demand as people order more goods from China/amazon). Similar, there is a huge amount of demand for raw materials as countries make their way out of the pandemic with government stimulus. Much of this demand is currently being driven by 'Chinese Special Bonds' (ie. more cheap money for infrastructure/raw materials).

In the handysize vessel segment alone, day-rates have now surpassed 2011 highs. This trade should continue for a while as more government stimulus is pumped into the system, central banks keep rates low and countries begin exiting lockdown/pandemic. There is a huge pent up demand and big infrastructure projects underway. Just look at the Biden administration's environmental agenda! A good way to get exposure to the upside in shipping is buying companies with handysize fleets. Due to the parcel size of the non-ferrous metals, handysize vessels are the best fit for non-ferrous transport.

An added bonus in Handysize at the moment is the fact that the fleet is aging (which means the oldest of them get scrapped) and the orderbook for new builds only makes  some 2% of current fleet. It takes 18 months (at least) to build a handysize so its not like the market can get flooded one day to the next. Demand currently far outstrips supply!

I would recommend that everyone has a look at the segment. Not all alpha has to come from brick phones and movie theaters....

Aflycted,0.0,44.0,"I’ve been wanting to do a post like this for a long time now. Now that healthcare has basically been the hottest thing for the last year (and somehow still getting even hotter), I thought it would be a good time. Many people try to buy into pharmaceutical companies around FDA approval targets without truly understanding what they’re getting into. Full disclosure, I am a doctor, but I will try to write this in layman’s terms as much as possible. If I get anything wrong, I’ll be sure to edit the post. To the best of my knowledge, everything I am about to say is researched (and therefore correct).

I’m going to go through the entire FDA approval process as a timeline, and then at the end, talk about other things to consider when investing in pharmaceuticals (i.e., more nuanced stuff that requires/applies healthcare understanding). One caveat here is people use “phases” in multiple ways. The way I will use it is the way I see most often being used in press releases and DD on reddit.

**Preclinical**: to begin, you must submit a proposal that basically states why you think a biologic compound will work. Without getting too technical, the preclinical is basically where you demonstrate a proof of concept. 

Here is a very generic example: Let’s say that HIV binds to GME receptor on cells. I have been doing petri dish experiments on a compound I created that prevents anything from binding to GME (this is *in vitro* if you ever see that term tossed around). I submit this evidence to the FDA and say that I think my compound will work in theory. TONS of things work *in vitro* and never progress beyond that. At this point, the FDA says, “okay we think your compound might work too, you can start human trials.”

&gt; Investor takeaway: the results of this phase mean absolutely nothing. If a drug failed in this phase, that would truly mean the company is incompetent in both their ability to assess the science, and in their ability to provide meaningful news to generate investor buzz. 

**Phase 1**: Anything that passes preclinical is ready for human trials. We are talking very small trials, like less than 100 people. For smaller companies, this is their chance to get some hype about their pharmaceutical. For anyone who understands the process, this is truly meaningless. Again, working in vitro does not (and likely will not) translate to working in humans. This phase typically lasts several months and is primarily designed to ensure that the drug is safe.

Here is a real life example, one that has already garnered a lot of attention: Atossa Therapeutics (ATOS) and their new breast cancer drug. Here is where medical knowledge (or solid research) can really help you. Their new breast cancer drug is called endoxifen. There are already multiple analogues (drugs that work in exactly the same way with minor differences in their chemical structures) on the market. Given the number of safe analogues on the market, it is likely (but not certain) this drug will be safe for human use. It is important to note here that phase 1 trials may be done on healthy participants without any disease, solely to test for safety. Accordingly, passage through phase 1 still may not demonstrate proof of concept on humans who have a particular disease.

Let’s say that ATOS had announced its intention to start testing breast cancer treatment and initiate phase 1 trials. Like I said, the likelihood of success is pretty high given the success of previous analogues. On the other hand the downside is huge. Companies can essentially go bankrupt at this stage if their “sure thing” drug or medical device fails. Always be sure to look at risk vs reward. A drug that enters phase 1 only has around a **14% likelihood** of making it all the way to FDA approval. Certain categories of drugs like those that treat cancer have even lower success rates (3.4%). While FDA drug approval does appear to be increasing **more than 80% of drugs that enter this stage will never see market.**

&gt;Investor takeaway: the road from here is super long and passing this phase really can’t tell you anything about its success in further stages. Many drugs are analogues and breeze through this phase, it is important not to get too hyped on them for that reason. 

**Phase 2**: Unlike phase 1 that focuses on drug safety, phase 2 tests the efficacy of the drug you are studying. This phase will typically have less than 1,000 participants, but they will all have the disease of interest. In this phase, we are looking to ensure that the drug works (provides statistically significant improvement) and is relatively safe as far as side effects. To limit research bias, sometimes we will divide the participants and give some the drug and keep some as the control group (they may get a placebo or no drug at all).

This is a pretty straightforward stage and lasts anywhere from months to years. It really depends on the drug being studied. I would never really expect a mainstream drug to get through this stage in under 6 months. The only conditions in which that would be logically feasible are either: 

1. COVID (solely because of the politicization of the process) or 

2. drugs treating conditions with extremely high mortality (because people won’t survive more than 6 months).

Lots of companies like to start releasing press releases close to FDA review of phase 2 results. Always be wary of those results. If my breast cancer drug was successful in 600 people and failed in 300, then while the numbers look good, the data may not be there. There is a lot that goes into statistical analysis and it isn’t quite as simple as more people did well than did poorly. 

It’s also important to realize that side effect profile is really important. Let’s say the aforementioned breast cancer agent ends up prolonging life in 80% of the study participants that received the drug. However, there’s also this nasty little side effect of developing a pulmonary embolism in 15-20% of people. That’s not insignificant and it is up to the FDA to decide whether or not the risk outweighs the benefit. Sometimes the FDA will order companies to redo this phase if the data are inconclusive. With cancer agents, this is common because the drugs are so toxic to so many parts of the body, so it really is about risk/benefit analysis.

The important thing to look at in this phase when comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group is what is called the p-value. For those of you who took stats, you should know what this is. For those that didn’t, just know that in healthcare, results with a p-value &gt;0.05 are considered insignificant. It’s also important to note that clinical and statistical significance are also key things to remember. Sometimes the benefit of the drug is so minimal that the side effect profile outweighs the benefits and the FDA will prevent the drug from moving forward. It’s also important to remember that if this is a drug entering a market where there are competitors, the FDA will look and see if this drug provides enough benefit over existing drugs before making a decision. 

One more nuance that pharmaceutical companies love to do is change the primary target. In the statistics world, that’s a pretty big no-no. If my initial proposal was that the breast cancer agent would prolong the life of my patients, and then suddenly I start talking about how it actually increases their pain-free time, this is a huge red flag. You can deduce that they likely didn’t meet their primary target and pivoted to something else they could meet. In any study you can find specific characteristic that makes you look good. 

&gt;Investor takeaway: this is the first phase that companies can really release “meaningful” information. Because of this, many companies try to raise funds at this time to capitalize on the hype, be wary of the words used in their press releases and marketing. 

**Phase 3**: Phase 3 is basically a repeat of phase 2, but bigger. It’s used to determine real efficacy of a drug. In raw numbers, we are looking at about 300-3,000 participants and up to 4 years of data. Phase 3 looks at the exact same things as phase 2: efficacy and side effects observed among a treated group (and sometimes compared to a control group).

Statistical significance, that is, the thing that tells you whether the drug worked, is based heavily upon power. If you want to increase power, you can increase the sample size. In phase 3, the FDA is giving the drug a chance to sink or swim. They are once again looking to make sure you don’t discover any new, obscure side effects and to ensure that the phase 2 results were not a statistical anomaly/the drug really does work.

Beyond sample size, the biggest difference between phases 2 and 3 is that we are observing a longer period of time for adverse events. Note the maximum time differences: up to 2 years for phase 2, and up to 4 years for phase 3. There are side effects that don’t manifest within the first 2 years. 
A very simple example is, actually cancer agents that cause cardiac fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis after years of use. These are things that may have been masked in the phase 2 study because the duration. 

The other thing is that we may discover rarer, more deadly side effects in this phase. Let’s say in phase 2, we found that 2 of our 1,000 participants developed brain cancer. The phase 2 data may show that this was statistically insignificant and cannot be attributed to the drug (remember, sample size is very important). Maybe the phase 3 study will suddenly show that another 8 people developed brain cancer and it was due to the drug. 

&gt;Investor takeaway: many drugs fail here, and not because they don’t work. They fail because they aren’t significantly better than what is available or the benefit is not enough to outweigh the risks. FDA approval isn’t simply contingent upon a drug working, there are many, many factors that come into play. 

**Phase 4**: this is the big phase, thousands of participants, possibly multiple hospitals around the country/world. This phase further increases the power of the data and shows that the drug really, really does work and is actually safe. Getting to phase 4 is actually a pretty big deal.

At this point, the company will apply for FDA approval including all of the information they have gathered at this point. In this stage, we are considering not only efficacy and safety, but also simplicity of use, and drug abuse potential. Drug abuse potential is a pretty hot topic right now because, well, opioid epidemic. Many opioids in the last few years have not received FDA approval solely because they are too easily abused. This entire application process takes 6-10 months for the FDA to review all the evidence and decide what happens.

It is not uncommon for the FDA to request more data before approving a drug or further review. Many times they will request the company conduct a new study of x to determine y. This is normal but can seriously impede the approval timeline of a drug. This is where you have to remember opportunity cost. After approval it goes to market, yay!

&gt;Investor takeaway: you may think once the drug receives FDA approval that you are out of the woods in terms of your investment. You would be wrong. 

**Making it to market**: When a drug finally hits market, there are two major things for investors to consider. Let’s start with the scary one, removal from the market. Remember how many times I’ve mentioned power, and sample size above? That becomes super relevant here. Depending on the drug, when it finally reaches market we may have many-fold more “participants” with which we can study the side effects of the drug. 

Sometimes drugs are pulled from the market because certain side effects emerge that flew under the radar during clinical trial phases. Sometimes the FDA sticks a black box warning on the drug (which really makes doctors stop prescribing it unless they have to). In either care, share prices tend to drop. They will plummet, though, if the FDA removes it from market.

**Market earnings**: The last “opportunity” for investors in the approval process is the sales data after the first quarter of marketing. This is where the company shows their revenue from the sale of the drug. If you have medical knowledge, you can really thrive here. If you don’t, you are likely to get screwed because you probably won’t understand the nuances in what drives physicians to prescribe drugs and avoid others. 

Just because a drug works super well doesn’t mean it will ever be used. Examples of that are ACRX’s new sufentanil agents. Those will likely see poor sales data because from a clinical perspective, even though they are approved, and work, they will almost never be used. You would  not know that without understanding the specifics of post-operative pain management.

And finally, a disclaimer. Anything I said here, I can be totally wrong. Sufentanil could become the most popular agent on the market for reasons I don’t understand or couldn’t fathom. Maybe ACRX will have an insanely good marketing team. I am simply talking about making the best decision based on the available knowledge. Stock prices are fickle beasts and they don’t always respond the way we expect.

**A message to those who tend to hold on to their bags to gamble on FDA approval:**

&gt; Yes, this really is gambling. Look at the statistics of how often drugs make it past each stage. You lost 40% on ATOS, you know what would be worse? Somehow their drug fails and now you have lost 80%. You see a drug running before FDA decision deadline, don’t buy it. No one knows how the FDA is going to respond and you are just as likely to lose your money than you are to make it.

&gt; Honestly, you are more likely to lose money because there are three outcomes, and two cause you to lose money, one of which will potentially bankrupt your position. The FDA could either approve the drug (yay!), outright reject the drug (oof), or ask for more information. That last one is kind of misleading because it may not mean the drug has failed, but it definitely will destroy the hype built up and tank the share price. The extra information requested could take forever to get and you would, once again, have to consider opportunity cost.

**What is Kratos:**

Kratos is a diversified mid cap defense technology company serving both the government and private sector in an array of next gen advancements. Products include microwave electronics for satellite communication. They are an accredited cybersecurity firm, including cloud protection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response training. Most notably, they have made a niche in autonomous vehicles, including military drones.

**Defense:**

Kratos carves out its role operating as an affordable autonomous technology company. In WW2, the US had a fleet of over 300,000 aircraft, establishing superiority in numbers. As technology evolved, and price skyrocketed, the military reduced its aircraft to its current total of 13,000 planes across all branches of the military. Today’s offerings from Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and others typically start at $80M, and quickly surpass $100M for many models.

Kratos’ new, state-of-the-art Valkyrie drone comes in at a relatively negligible $2M, and can be equipped with two small diameter bombs. Compare this to the single-use cost of $1.87M for a Raytheon Tomahawk missile, and it’s easy to see the market value for these autonomous drones. With a range of over 2,000 miles, a single Valkyrie can cover the equivalent ground of traveling from Arizona to New York in a single flight.

While the Valkyrie is both affordable and capable, its true value lies in the potential uses in revolutionizing next gen warfare. With global superpowers such as Russia and China developing their own technology to rival that found in US aircraft, America (and its allies) can no longer rely on technological superiority for military domination. We may very well see a return to volume domination. Valkyrie, with its affordability, can overwhelm the skies through sheer numbers. Additionally, Valkyries can be linked to manned aircraft, serving as scouts ahead of the operator, and even sacrificing itself to protect both the pilot and the more expensive aircraft.

**It’s not just defense:**

Kratos is much more diversified than simple defense drones. Kratos designs and deploys technology for satellites. In addition to US government contracts, they have branched into the public sector, securing partnerships with companies such as Microsoft, who have enlisted Kratos to help with Azure.

Kratos autonomous vehicles save lives domestically as well. They have over 30 contracts lined up to supply road work crews with autonomous vehicles. The “go around” truck at the back of every road crew is one of the most dangerous jobs in the industry, with the truck serving as a literal shield between work teams and approaching traffic. Not only does Kratos autonomous technology eliminate the need for a human driver, their technology can be retrofitted onto existing trucks, making them a much more cost effective option than buying all new vehicles.

**What about financials:**

While Kratos has a long way to go before becoming a bonafide superpower, they’ve made immense strides over the past few years financially. They recently became profitable, and have been growing revenues admirably YoY. While I’d love to see better margins, they’ve definitely improved over the past three years. Kratos has doubled its cash on hand, without incurring any notable increase in debt. Shareholder equity has seen strong growth, improving to over $800M from $300M just a year ago. Lastly, Kratos currently has a book to bill ratio of 1.8, meaning they have more backorders than they can fill, a promising sign for demand and continued profitability.

**What’s next:**

Kratos will need to continue to improve margins to grow into a profitable company. The orders are there, it’s just a matter of getting the production line up and running. As autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, and satellite technology continue to grow, so to should Kratos grow.

Kratos has proven an ability to punch above its market cap. While they’ve not yet secured the multi billion dollar contracts that LMT, BA, and RTX enjoy, they’ve won numerous contracts in their own right, and have seemed to establish themselves as a player in national defense. They may prove to be a lucrative acquisition for one of the aforementioned mega corporations, or may be a prime candidate for a merger with a similar valued company, but regardless, Kratos seems to be an interesting play in an increasingly tech-driven world.

**Institutional backing:**

Kratos boasts a healthy interest from hedge funds and other institutions. Most major funds hold significant shares, with Blackrock leading the pack. They’ve already secured investment from Ark, and are all but guaranteed a large investment when ARKX comes online. Given the hype around other Ark endorsed funds, I would expect a modest pop off that news alone.

**Tl;dr** 

Kratos is a diversified military and tech company with both government and private sector contracts, and should be a strong growth candidate going forward.

Gay_Demons,0.0,43.0,"Rigel Pharmaceuticals is a relatively small biopharmaceutical company (\~$600m capitalization) primed for growth in 2021 and beyond. From increasing product sales (%40+ year over year), to forming large partnerships w/ major companies (Eli Lilly) in the industry, to finding new indications for their lead product Tavalisse (fostamatinib; R406) that apply to the current pandemic they're on track for a breakout. Below I'll be discussing their fundamentals, pipeline, price targets, and the rational behind fostamatinib being a severe Covid therapeutic unlike any other.

**Fostamatinib background and what you should know about its role in preventing severe Covid**

Fostamatinib is orally taken and FDA approved to treat Immune thrombocytopenia; a disease by which the immune system destroys blood platelets. Fostamatinib has been shown to have a 78% response rate in chronic patients who receive this as a second line therapy. Currently the company has made about $60m in net sales from ITP in 2020 ($108m total revenue) and is expecting steady growth in 2021. Their partners have also gained approval for this indication in Europe and Canada; with Israel expected in early 2021, and Asian markets sometime in 2022. Rigel will receive milestone payments and royalties for sales outside the US.

Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia is a disease by which the immune system destroys red blood cells and there are no approved treatments for this debilitating disease. Fostamatinib is the only drug in a phase 3 wAIHA study and is expected to complete enrollment by the summer of 2021 with hopeful trial completion sometime early 2022. The FDA has also granted this trial with a fast-tracked status which will knock 3 months off the review process.

The same immune pathway that fostamatinib acts on to stop blood platelet and red blood cell destruction has also been demonstrated in a National Institute of Health study to prevent the immune destruction of neutrophils (NETosis) in severe Covid blood serum; in the study fostamatinib returned neutrophil destruction back to baseline levels. NETosis normally happens in a highly regulated way - essentially the immune system destroys neutrophils to release their cellular contents into the blood serum, which acts like small fibrotic ""nets"" that can stop pathogens from spreading but in severe Covid it is done to such an extent that it can become very problematic and is suspected of promoting thrombosis that may cause multi-organ failure, heart attack, stroke and death. When this takes place in the lungs it may even cause the mucous to become thick and gel-like and lead to respiratory distress. A short but interesting video of an NIH doctor discussing NETosis implications and their ""wow moment"" has been linked below along with their study using fostamatinib.

Additionally, a Harvard and MIT study found that elevated mucin-1 was linked to poor Covid outcomes. Mucin-1 is a protein that is normally found in the lungs and may serve as an innate defense against pathogens, however if too much mucin-1 is released it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. They ran a screen of the 3700 drugs in their database looking for an FDA approved drug that could inhibit mucin 1 and found only 1 FDA approved drug that could both inhibit mucin-1 and preserve cellular integrity; fostamatinib. The implications however, they noted, go beyond Covid as mucin-1 elevation is an indicator of poor outcomes in other non-Covid lung diseases such as viral pneumonias, cystic fibrosis and COPD. The CEO gave an interview to The Fly several months ago and indicated that the non-Covid lung injury opportunity may be a much larger and more enduring than Covid alone. Note that late in 2019 before Covid was a known entity the company by chance had completed a mouse study where they were able to prevent acute lung injury as well so it was already on their radar.

Further, a University of Amsterdam study identified the mechanism by which a cytokine storm was occurring in severe Covid patients. Cytokine storms can damage tissue, lead to organ failure, and cause respiratory distress. They found that these patients were producing anti-igg antibodies that were causing their immune system to over-react. When they applied just these antibodies to serum that was not from severe patients they able to replicate the cytokine storm in vitro. They understood that the SYK pathway could likely stop this over-reaction and used the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib to fully neutralize the cytokine storm.

This research lead to two investigator sponsored clinical trials by the NIH and Imperial College of London that are now studying fostamatinib on severe Covid patients. Rigel itself has an on-going phase 3 Covid trial as well and this year received a $16.5M grant from the Dept of Defense to complete that study. Results from the investigator sponsored trials are expected by early April, and if compelling the CEO suggested in a JPMorgan presentation that they will combine any available phase 3 data with those studies and pursue an emergency use authorization to market their drug for the treatment of Covid-19. Additionally a Covid partnership has been mentioned because, ""the opportunity is just so large."" \[in regards to these studies of note is that once patients are recovering they are sending them home with a 2 week bottle of fostamatinib which is a substantial advantage over other products that require injection or transfusion\]

**Rigel has an extensive drug discovery program and have Rip1 and Irak1/4 inhibitors in development**

Rigel developed its experimental RIP1 inhibitor through stage 1 and very recently partnered with Eli Lilly to further develop RIP1 for multiple indications in stage 2 studies. In February 2021 it was announced Rigel will receive $125M upfront from Lilly, with the opportunity to earn $835 million in milestone payments, as well as royalties from any future drug sales. While this is a co-development agreement Lilly holds most of the responsibility and Rigel's royalty % will be based on the amount of their involvement.

Rigel has an Irak1/4 drug program that has recently completed a phase 1 study. A possible partnership may be in the works here as well but as Rigel has experience in the rheumatic indications they may go it alone.

Additionally, Rigel has out-licensed multiple other drugs from which they receives on-going milestone payments w/ the potential for future royalties.

As an aside, the CEO has stated that Rigel can discover new drugs better than anyone. They have a robust patent list that extends well beyond what's visible on their current pipeline.

**Price Target and institutional ownership**

As news from the Eli Lilly deal was announced multiple analysts who follow the company increased their price targets of Rigel. Only Pantginis noted he has Covid factored into his PT.

H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis increased his price target from $8 to $11.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Kristen Kluska increased her price target from $5 to $7.

BMO Capital analyst Do Kim raised the price target from $8 to $9.

Rigel is currently valued at \~$4.15

Rigel has a high institutional ownership ranging between 80-90%.

A recent Marketwatch article discussing small cap stocks with the most upside listed Rigel as the #1 biotech based on present analyst recommendations.

Sand_B,0.0,42.0," EHang Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: EH) (“EHang” or the “Company”), the world's leading autonomous aerial vehicle (“AAV”) technology platform company, today releases additional details to rebut the allegations made by the short-seller, Wolfpack Research, concerning its relationship with a customer, Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Kunxiang”):

Kunxiang is one of EHang’s customers but it is not a related party of EHang. Kunxiang had never been a shareholder of EHang prior to its IPO. Kunxiang has never purchased any shares from EHang after its IPO. Although any person can purchase EHang’s ADSs from the open market after EHang becomes a public company, EHang has no knowledge that Kunxiang has ever purchased any of EHang’s ADSs, and EHang does not believe Kunxiang holds any meaningful shares whatsoever in the Company at any given time. 

On February 1, 2019, EHang entered into a sales contract with Kunxiang to sell 3 units of EHang 216 passenger-grade AAVs for a total price of RMB4.5 million, or RMB1.5 million per unit (inclusive of value-added tax). EHang has posted a copy of this contract as well as its English translation on its IR website: https://ir.ehang.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs.

Pricing and other terms provided by EHang to Kunxiang are not substantially different from those offered to other customers in China and all contracts with Kunxiang are based on arm-length transactions. The average unit price under EHang’s February 2019 contract with Kunxiang is in line with the average unit price for the Company’s overall passenger-grade AAV sales since 2019. Although the Company has not directly disclosed the average selling price of its passenger-grade AAVs in its public filings, such average selling price can be inferred from two metrics the Company does publicly disclose: (i) the number of passenger-grade AAVs sold in a period, and (ii) the amount of revenues generated by air mobility solutions, which have mostly been derived from the sales of passenger-grade AAVs, in the same period.

While it is not EHang’s place to comment on its customer’s office buildings or employees, Kunxiang has confirmed to EHang that the allegations made by the short-seller concerning Kunxiang or its employees in this so-called research report are false and misleading. Just for an example, the Wolfpack Research told an outright lie that the office building where Kunxiang is located only has 11 floors by showing an office building index, but a simple site visit will tell you that building indeed has 15 floors.

Kunxiang remains as an important customer of EHang. EHang appreciates that Kunxiang has the vision to be an early adopter of EHang future-defining products and EHang intends to strengthen its relationship with Kunxiang. However, Kunxiang is no longer the largest customer of EHang in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

As EHang has previously stated, Wolfpack Research’s report was based on shoddy research and contains numerous, unsubstantiated statements, and misinterpretation of information. EHang intends to engage legal counsel to pursue legal actions against Wolfpack Research for its malicious act and false allegations.",stocks,Chinese AAV EHang further rebuts Wolfpack's short report (as published on their investor relations).... 👇,42.0,0.96

Before I begin, this is not Financial Advice and I am doing this as a form of interest and hope everyone would see value in companies as I do. This is currently my 2nd outlook of a company and if you like what I post, do give me an upvote as a form of support. If you want to stay up to date on my outlook of companies, do follow me. Without further ado let's begin.

# Who is Sea Ltd

Sea was founded in Singapore (my homeland, not bias!)  on 8 May 2009 and it is a consumer internet company. The company itself operates three different types of businesses such as Shopee, Garena and SeaMoney. I believe you guys know one of such business in your daily life! So let's break down these three businesses step by step and see if this company is really worth investing in.

# Shopee

It is the number 1 e-commerce platform in ASEAN regions like Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, and Singapore and was launched in 2015. Just recently, they launch their platform in Brazil. Shopee is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in 2019 according to Frost &amp; Sullivan. Shopee has adopted a mobile-first approach that connects both buyers and sellers while ensuring a convenient, safe, and trusted platform for your shopping needs! There are different services and AI-powered tools that Shopee offers such as Image recognition and also Live stream of sellers selling their items.

To engage their customers, there are addictive games like candy crush lookalike, claw machines and many other simple games to earn coins from it. 

Ok, let's get the boring stuff out as I feel like I am lecturing.

|:-|:-|:-|
|GMV|US$8b|111.2% Y-o-Y|
|Adjusted EBITDA|US$305.5m|23.4% Y-o-Y|

Based on simple financials, Shopee revenue has been constantly rising and it is not stopping as they are still expanding their platform to many more countries.

&gt;!Hell ya! Based on Shopee alone I'm buying SE for the long term!!&lt;

# Garena

It is a leading global online game developer and publisher and it has a global footprint across 130 markets. In July 2020, *Free Fire* broke a new record in monthly paying users which has doubled Y-o-Y. The game tournament fueled over 120million online views

|Adjusted Revenue|US$716.2m|61.6% Y-o-Y|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Adjusted EBITDA|US$436.2m|65.4% Y-o-Y|

# SeaMoney

It is a digital financial services provider and its services include payment processing, credit-related digital financial offerings, and e-wallets. They have other products such as ShopeePay and Airpay. This segment is slowly booming and would get mainstream soon as people are adopting cashless payments in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

|Total Payment Volume (3Q 2020)|US$2.1b|
|:-|:-|
|Quarterly Paying Users (3Q 2020)|17.8m|
|Shopee's Gross Orders|30%|

With the insane growth of the different businesses, It is not over as there are still markets that are untouched. With the innovation of e-commerce services, fun and engaging game contents and a convenient booming digital financial services, these 3 business categories will only continue to rise!

# Plausible Risk

As Sea Ltd generates revenue from user, the only way for them to continue generating revenue would be user traffic. The size and engagement of its consumer are critical for the success of Sea if they want to continue growing. There are many competitors that each investors must know. They are:

1) Alibaba

2) Tencent

3) Coupang

With the fierce competition that they face, failure to meet the demands of the ever-changing needs of consumers will rapidly decrease the user growth rate. This will lead to Sea Ltd incurring high expenditure to source for new consumers which will indefinitely affect their profits.

Additionally, with the economic slowdown, fewer users may be keen on using their E-commerce platform - Shopee. However, from COVID-19, it has shown an increase in the number of users using it. However, in the event whereby the economy actually affects them, the paid advertising revenue and transaction-based fees will fall which results in lower revenue.

# Thoughts and process based on information

The company's outlook is impressive and many investors would be keen to jump in with it. However, the current share price is currently overvalued and would enter at $230 or below.

roosoh,0.0,41.0,"I’ve recently come across a company that I really believe is a diamond in the rough. 

Ocean Power Technologies (Nasdaq:OPTT) is a pioneer in renewable wave-energy technology that converts ocean wave energy into electricity. OPT's proprietary PowerBuoy® technology is based on a modular design and has undergone periodic ocean testing since 1997. OPT specializes in advanced autonomous (not grid connected), cost-effective, and environmentally sound ocean wave based power generation and management technology.

The PowerBuoy system integrates patented technologies in hydrodynamics, electronics, energy conversion, and computer control systems to extract the natural energy in ocean waves. The result is a leading edge, ocean-tested, proprietary autonomous system that turns wave power into reliable, clean, and environmentally beneficial electricity for offshore applications.

OPT just recently released a new surveillance system powered through the PowerBuoy. A single OPT Surface Surveillance Solution can monitor more than 1600 square miles of ocean surface on a permanent or temporary basis, with the ability to seamlessly link multiple surveillance assets together over large ocean areas giving end-users visibility into potentially damaging environmental or illegal activities. Customized solutions are also available including the addition of subsea sensors to monitor for acoustic signatures, tsunami activity, and water quality.

OPT’s Surface Surveillance Solution payload consists of a high definition radar, gyro-stabilized high definition optical and thermal imaging cameras, vessel automatic identification system (AIS) detection, and integrated command and control software, paired with OPT’s autonomous PB3 PowerBuoy or hybrid PowerBuoy as a power and communications platform. Capabilities include 24/7 vessel tracking – including “black ships” which do not broadcast an AIS signal – automatic radar plotting and vessel warnings, and high definition optical and thermal video surveillance which can be used as evidence to aid in prosecution.

I feel there is a lot of growth potential for this stock, they are setting themselves up to be not only a renewable energy source but also a government asset with their high tech surveillance system.

Their stock rebuy program put additional pressure on that issue specifically.

I think thats an interesting pick with quite some potential.

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) pulling back while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose, rebounding from its worst selloff since October. Market participants continue to nervously eye rising Treasury yields. 

The saga between market makers and retail traders continues. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily suspended a list of companies from trading due to “questionable trading and social media activity,” according to a statement from the Commission. The SEC alleges that ""Certain social media accounts may be engaged in a coordinated attempt to artificially influence their share prices.” A full list of the halted securities can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2021/34-91213-o.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery).

On Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives is anticipated to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package. The bill includes an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks to most Americans, $400 per week in augmented federal unemployment insurance, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government relief. The bill would then head to the U.S. Senate, with many lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before a mid-March cliff for when current pandemic-era benefits are set to expire.

Treasury yields were mostly lower today at 1.424% at the time of writing but continue to hover near one-year highs. Treasury yields are the interest rate the US government pays on its debt obligations, such as bonds. Very basically, rising Treasury yields affect the stock market in two ways: (1) it makes Treasury bonds more attractive assets for investment and (2) raises the cost of borrowing money for companies, which is why high-flying tech stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday.  Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management said, ""Driving rates higher has been a combination of higher growth expectations as well as higher inflation expectations. Until recently, market participants have been able to digest the upward drift in long-term rates, but it appears that the next leg up in interest rates is a bigger bite to chew. Looking at where real yields were at, they were simply too low when considering growth expectations, and it’s likely that long-term real yields will continue to drift higher as economic data improves."" In other words, expectations for more growth in the market, combined with inflationary fears are lowering demand in bonds, which in turn raises the yield.

Helium isn’t just used a balloon filler and its use is expected to only increase:

* Helium is known as a super-cooler and is used to cool superconductors - an industry expected to grow massively in the next decade.
* Helium is used in many high tech applications such as MRI Scanners and Cryogenics. (20% of all Helium is used in the manufacture and use of MRI Scanners)
* Helium is used to pressurise and stiffen rocket tanks - another growth industry.
* Helium is used in Heliox mixtures in respiratory medicine for people with Asthma and Bronchitis.

The Helium market was valued at $10.6 billion in 2019, expecting to grow 11% to $15.73 billion by 2023.

However, there is one small issue with this ever-growing demand for Helium, **SUPPLY IS RUNNING OUT**.

**The global supply of Helium is running out - The Helium Crisis.**

Helium is actually a finite resource meaning when it’s gone, it’s gone. Not only this, we have found no way to manufacture or synthesise Helium. At current rates of supply and demand some scientists believe we may run out in as soon as 10 years. Not only this, currently 100% of the global supply of Helium only comes as a by-product of hydrocarbon production. With the global shift to renewable energy, inevitably oil and gas fields will eventually shut, again reducing the supply of helium.

Global demand of helium is estimated to be 6 billion cubic feet per annum with the unit price per thousand cubic feet has risen 135% in the past two years. 

On top of this, there seems to not be any perfect replacements for Helium due to its long list of desirable properties:

* Inert.
* Lighter than air/low density (preferred over hydrogen due to being inflammable).
* High diffusion rate - used to test for leaks in machinery.
* Very low boiling point - used to give metals superconductivity.
* High thermal conductivity.

**Solutions:**
- Multiple exploration companies targeting primary underground Helium wells.
- Re-circulation/Re-use of Helium.
- Helium gathered in space.

This makes sense for anyone opening up a long position in a company they see as a disruptive force for the future, but what caught my eye here was the fact that the **next earnings report is on 2/26, a little shy of 3 weeks away from these moves.**

Looking back, DKNG has missed the mark and their projected earnings in recent quarters due to their insistence on advertising spending and more notably the lack of active sports to bet on in Q2 and Q3 of last year, but Q4 2020 sees the start up of the NFL, the NHL, and the last parts of the NBA Playoffs. This points to a potential to potentially beat projections and start getting things moving in the right direction. Regardless, they're the largest company in online sports betting and currently lead other online companies in this sector with 16% of the market locked down since October.

With legalization of sports gambling in our future with the new administration, a lot of heads have been turning to this market and there's a sizable chunk of revenue incentivizing the legalization in the states that haven't done so already.

TL/DR

ARKW more than doubled their position in DKNG the past 2 weeks and we're coming up on an earnings report that has some potential to be a sign of things turning around for sports betting in a covid world.

I think it's time for an updated DD on **AUPH (Aurinia Pharmaceuticals)**. 

This is an undervalued company and I think the excellent DD that was done by u/thedudeabides86 was mostly overlooked due to the GMEania and AMCraze happening at that time.

 Also...maybe Lupus isn't as sexy as EV or gene editing but there is definitely some asymmetrical payoff potential here. 

So whats up...

**On January 22nd AUPH’s drug Voclosporin(Lupkynis) was approved by the FDA and considered the new first line of defense for Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Lupus Nephritis (LN).**

Voclosporin(Lupkynis), used to treat Lupus Nephritis, received the PDUFA approval from the FDA late on Friday Jan 22nd, around 7:23 pm. This drug is significantly superior to the only alternative treatment and reported twice the efficacy of the current standard of care. Because of this it was given priority review status by the FDA.

[https://ir.auriniapharma.com/press-releases/detail/210/fda-approves-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-lupkynis#:\~:text=](https://ir.auriniapharma.com/press-releases/detail/210/fda-approves-aurinia-pharmaceuticals-lupkynis#:~:text=)(NASDAQ%3A%20AUPH%20%2F%20TSX%3A,active%20lupus%20nephritis%20(LN).

**Real quick, what is SLE and LN?**

[LN](https://www.webmd.com/lupus/lupus-nephritis?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link#1) is inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), a severe autoimmune disease. LN can eventually lead to kidney failure which is deadly unless the patient gets a kidney transplant.

**Why is it the first line of defense?** 

Prior to Voclosporin(Lupkynis) being designated as the first line of defense, the distinction went to Benlysta(produced By GSK). Benlysta was approved for adult patients with LN just last year. However, Voclosporin(Lupkynis) has twice the efficacy, is faster acting and is oral versus injection. Current treatments require many injections over several phases requiring many in-person visits for treatment. Voclosporin(Lupkynis) can also be administered with less corticosteroids than Belysta, which reduces side effects and slightly reduces overall treatment cost, comparatively.

**Very real possibility of $4B in annual revenue from a company with a current market cap of $2B**

Around 330K people in the US suffer from SLE and 30-40% of patients diagnosed with SLE have or  will develop LN (\~120k). Voclosporin’s(Lupkynis) estimated annual treatment per patient is $65K. For an assumed total market of just under $8B. While 100% of the market is not a reasonable assumption, It seems within reason that the first line of defense treatment should take 50% of the market share or better.

* FDA patent extension until 2038. That’s 17 years of exclusive rights to this treatment. 
* Buy out potential is present as AUPH CEO has stated that the board would be open to a buyout and the uncomplicated structure of the company combined with the blockbuster drug would make a buy out very possible. 
* Earnings report expected date of Mar. 4th 2021

**The Devils advocate:**

* **The cost of treatment could potentially be prohibitive to persons without health insurance.** 
* **While AUPH holds quite a lot of capital it pales in comparison to bigger pharma giants like GSK and Roche.**  
* **Timing of release makes it difficult for sales reps to connect with doctors during covid restrictions.**

Ok-Midnight9757,0.0,37.0,"Why is the market tanking in recent weeks?

First,  what it isn't: Treasury yields.  Don't listen to the news.  This just means that no one wants to buy bonds so the price of bonds is going down to attract new investors.  This happens in a healthy economy.  Can't believe the fake news is really pushing this.

What I would see if this was anything other than a correction:

Consumer cyclical and natural resource holdings would increase with major  investment firms.  Positions in small cap stocks would decrease.  Real  estate holdings would increase.

How I know these things aren't happening:

It's  best to track these activities through major firms and ETFs.  I track SPY's holdings daily.  They have teams of analysts and resources I just  don't have.  They're the first to know.  I do not watch the news for  financial information.

So what is it?

I  see firms reorganizing portfolio's for a post-C19 market.  IE, aerospace and defense stocks are going up in the same time the Nasdaq was down 9%.  Travel stocks like JetBlue are also doing well in that time frame.

When will it stop?

Who knows, but it couldn't have been expected and it's too late to sell  high and buy low now.  I'm waiting it out.  I have been increasing  positions with remaining cash but I'm out going forward.

Will tech rebound?

Yes.   New tech is where the money is.  I see strong cross-sector growth continuing through Q3 this year.  Q1 industrial is very strong so far.   Many of these up and coming tech companies are going to be pushing into  their manufacturing phases.

How bonds work since many don't understand (I don't blame them):

The  ""price"" of bonds go down as demand goes up and goes up when the demand  goes down.  Think of it this way, the lower I sell my bond, the less  money I have to spend in the long run as a bond ""seller"".  As a buyer, I  get more money if I buy a bond with a high rate of return vs low.  So  you won't sell many bonds with a low rate.  Thus, if bonds need to be  sold, the rate goes up.  This is an indication that no one is buying  them and the money is likely going to the market or being held as cash.    Thus, a yield from a bond is how much money you'll make based on the  rate of return.  This is reflected in the Treasury Yield curve.  The   curve itself reacts faster with short-term bonds than long-term bonds.    If they cross, this can be a bad indication of rapid market changes.   The safest investment in the entire world is a US Treasury Bond.  That's  for two main reason: first, it's never lost anyone money; second, the  US has the ability to tax the wealthiest population on the planet if  anything happens.  So what that means, people put their money in US  bonds when they think things aren't going well.  When things are going  well, they get out of them and put the money back in the market.",stocks,No need to panic,37.0,0.73

steve-rodrigue,0.0,39.0,"Hey everyone,
We are building a new web of decentralized (p2p) databases that will enable to create content the way they like, and connect it to a p2p network where other contributors built their own database. It also contains a browser that can show visualization in 2D and 3D. On top of that network, we will have a p2p application store hosted and managed by its network.

To make this easier to explain, Ill use a potential use-case that fits perfectly well with stock trading.

Imagine a group of people creating a database that explains the different products that a specific field has.  Let's say the product is water filters.

Then, we have a group of scientists that read whitepapers and comment on them.  They comment on the whitepapers of the research behind different water filters products.

You then have a something syncing social network data to databases, enabling the ability to discover if people are talking about water filters, and which ones.

Then, you have someone creating lists of leads that work in companies.  That person wants to approach them to sell them something, but that data could be used to know which person works in which company, and what they are saying on social media.

You also have someone crawling news and put the data in a database, then add the sources to the news articles in order to rank them from credible to fake.

At last, you have someone taking sales ranking using the ebay and amazon marketplaces and put them in a database.

At last, you have a software developer, fetching data from all these databases and creating a dashboard related to water filter products.  

That dashboard contains:

* The sentiment of the company from employees (how they personally feel, if they talk about the product they build on social media, what's their sentiments, etc). 

* What credible media tells about the stock of water filters companies.  It contains the data of what researchers thinks about each product.

* The sentiment of retail traders on social media regarding that company.

* The fundamentals of the companies in the water filter business

* Previous sales on marketplaces.

You then can connect your broker's application using their api and correlate the data with the price of stocks/options over time.

Then can decide to take position on the ones you like.

Then, the application that the developer created can be sold inside the decentralized (p2p) marketplace within the network, allowing him to make a revenue and allowing traders to acquire data to make better due diligence.

The project name is called /r/DeepValueNetwork .  We are currently developing it, its source code is at: https://github.com/deepvalue-network/software

You can read more about this project by reading this light introduction article: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepValueNetwork/comments/lfau93/a_simple_introduction_to_the_deep_value_network/

Or this longer post: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepValueNetwork/comments/ldk8cp/what_is_the_plan_for_deepvaluenetwork_what_value/

I'm currently answering the community's question about the project.  Ill be adding a lot of technical documentation with the remaining code in order to create its MVP over the next 7-10 days.

Do you see such tool being something useful in your day-to-day as a stock broker?  The goal is to make a platform where each person or group of person adds value, and others can build on top of that value.

Please let me know if you have any question!  I'm taking the day off in order to answer everyone regarding this open source project!

When I first signed up for Goldman Sachs “Marcus” app, I was impressed with the simplicity. The app is fast and sleek yet has all necessary bells and whistles. Something very “easy to use half asleep at 2 am”. You can send a one click wire. There’s a tracker that shows progress for any bonuses you’re eligible for. Their investment in simplicity compared to other, complicated apps made me move all of my savings to them, and I’d probably move my checking to them too when they launch that. 

I was recently surprised to find this again in a second company - Square’s cash app. The second I opened it for the first time, I likened it to a “fisher price app” - super simple to use, super simple to understand, clean interface - yet powerful.

I unfortunately can’t find a link to an article I read recently, but it showed that people are experiencing app overload and prefer 8-10 apps ... no more. I believe this trend towards simplicity will continue and would like to factor it into my investment decisions moving forward (for my “play” account).

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-17-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set to open flat after Dow closes at another record

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were steady Wednesday as Wall Street remained on track for its best monthly performance since November. A mixed session Tuesday saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average close at another record. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq broke their two-day winning streaks with small losses, falling from previous session record high closes.

&gt; * On Wednesday’s economic calendar, the Commerce Department is set to issue January retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect a 1.2% increase after a 0.7% December decline. At the same time, the Labor Department’s January look at producer prices is seen rising 0.4% after a 0.3% gain in December.

*****

&gt; # 2. B/itcoin soars to new high, topping $51,000 for first time

&gt; * B/itcoin smashed through $51,000 to hit a new all-time high Wednesday. Major financial companies appear to be warming to b/itcoin, while Tesla and other firms have also shown support for the c/ryptocurrency. B/itcoin’s latest rally is reminiscent of its massive ascent to nearly $20,000 in 2017, which was followed by an 80% plunge the following year. However, the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency did stage a fierce comeback since, more than quadrupling in 2020 and gaining over 70% since the start of this year.

*****

&gt; # 3. Here are Warren Buffett-run Berkshire’s stock moves last quarter

&gt; * Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought stakes worth $4.1 billion in Chevron and $8.6 billion in Verizon shares during the fourth quarter, according to the conglomerate’s latest 13-F filing with the SEC. Berkshire also sold its stakes in drug maker Pfizer and JPMorgan Chase, while trimming its Wells Fargo position. While still its biggest holding, Berkshire continued to trim its lucrative Apple stake, cutting it by about 6%. Four times a year, investors file their long positions with the government. The information is released to the public 45 days after each quarter ends.

*****

&gt; # 4. Elon Musk’s SpaceX valuation jumps to about $74 billion

&gt; * SpaceX completed another monster equity funding round of $850 million last week, people familiar with the financing told CNBC, sending the company’s valuation skyrocketing 60% from its previous raise in August to about $74 billion. Elon Musk, who also co-founded Tesla, saw insiders and existing investors in his commercial space company selling an additional $750 million in a secondary transaction, one of the people said. SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on this report.

*****

&gt; # 5. Millions in Texas still without power as new storm hits

&gt; * Millions of residents in Texas were still in the dark Wednesday with no indication when their service might return as another winter storm moved across the southern part of the nation. In all, between 2 million and 3 million customers in the energy capital of the U.S. had no power — two days after historic snow and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity for heat.

&gt; * Wholesale power and natural gas prices soared in recent days. However, natural gas futures dropped early Wednesday. U.S. oil prices kept up their advance Wednesday, gaining more than 1% and pushing above $61 per barrel, levels not seen since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

So, the popular opinion was that when the new administration took over this year, that clean energy stocks were going to rally in a big way, and oil was going to suffer. But even as Biden gives speech after speech declaring his commitment to clean energy, day after day, oil stocks keep outperforming, and clean energy stocks / etfs get slaughtered (I'm looking at you, ICLN &amp; QCLN).

Wasn't it supposed to be the other way around? Or is it an unintended consequence that squeezing big oil produces more scarcity in the commodity due to production constraints?

Did we just expect too much too soon in the clean energy space? What's strange is that pot stocks are (ahem - *were*) up huge on the expectation of nationwide legalization, even though that's far below clean energy on Biden's list of priorities.

MTGKozan,0.0,35.0,"So, I know this gain is nothing compared to others on here, but my day was made today. When I first got into the stock market 3 months back, this was the first stock I ever bought and I made it about 25% of my portfolio after researching it ($5k initial investment). My average cost was $6.80. In December, when they came out with good news from their Phase II trials it went up which was exciting, and hovered around $8-$10. Today as soon as the news of their successful stage- 3 clinical trial cure for bone/blood cancers released with overwhelmingly positive results it LEAPED after hours! I'm now up approximately 150% on GMDA (Over $6,600 gain today alone). I think I saw it as high as $18.15 post-presentation and has consolidated around $16.60 range. I do believe we'll see another run at market open tomorrow based on the news. It was a stock I felt good about investing in initially, and it's awesome to see 150%+ gains from your first ever stock pick. This stock helped push my entire portfolio to 55% gains overall in a little under 3 months.

For those who don't know what Gamida Cell ($GMDA) is, they are an advanced Israeli-based cell therapy company committed to cures for patients with blood cancers and serious blood diseases.

Their main focus is Omidubicel, an advanced cell therapy under development as a potential life-saving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (bone marrow) transplant solution for patients with hematologic malignancies (blood cancers). With Omidubicel, it results in faster recovery, fewer infections, and fewer days in the hospital, and increased survival than the standard umbilical cord blood transplantation that's currently in use in the medical system. Omidubicel should be considered the new standard of care for patients eligible for the umbilical cord blood transplantation if they get FDA approval (which I think they will).

Even with this recent leap in price, I think it still has a LONG way to run. The clinical data results will form the basis of a Biologics License Application (BLA) that Gamida Cell expects to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2021. If it works out, they could be one of the first blood cancer-curing companies to be FDA approved which would be HUGE! If they get FDA approval this year it's going to run even more. I still don't think it's too late to jump in on this stock. Cathy Wood has even added a lot of it to ARK.

Also, I'm not a financial advisor. I've been in the stock market less than 3 months, but this is my DD on the company. Be sure to do your own DD before making any financial decisions. Just my opinion on the stock. If you want to see their full Phase 3 presentation from tonight, click the link below:

x--BANKS--x,0.0,53.0,"It’s clear the narrative of the market right now is about the rotation from growth to value stocks. There are going to be a lot of fearful investors moving their money, and a lot of fund managers buying up value stocks to please their skittish customers. 

So I started looking for stocks with a low P/E ratio and the highest StarMine scores. StarMine is a scoring system used on Fidelity and some other brokers which uses an aggregate of analyst ratings. In other words, these stocks are universally rated buy and a likely target of cautious investors, and their low P/E puts them into the value basket. I’m not trying to get complicated. I’m looking for undervalued stocks with mainstream surface appeal. 

(Important to note that I am not saying StarMine scores are an accurate ranking of stocks, but only that I'm using them a proxy for where mainstream money will go during this rotation.)

The first group is what I’ll call Value Boomer Bait:
 
* StarMine Equity Score of 9.1 or higher
* Consumer discretionary company with a household name  
* P/E ratio below 18

This gives you four good leads:

* WILLIAMS-SONOMA (WSM)
* AUTONATION (AN)
* JACK IN THE BOX (JACK)
* 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (FLWS)

Two similar leads without household names are AMERICA'S CAR-MART (CRMT) and HAVERTY FURNITURE (HVT).

The second group of obvious value stocks I found are some undervalued recreational boating companies with steady growth. ONEWATER MARINE (ONEW) and MARINEMAX (HZO) are high-end boat retailers, both with a StarMine score of 9.7, both with a P/E ratio of 11.9, and both with steady growth that was unaffected by the market sell-off. You can also look at BRUNSWICK CORP (BC), a manufacturer of boat components, which has a StarMine score of 9.4 and a P/E of 19.3. 

A lot of people have been looking at homebuilding recently, so here’s the homebuilders with a StarMine Score of 9.1 or higher and a P/E below 12:

* GREEN BRICK PARTNERS (GRBK)
* CENTURY COMMUNITIES (CCS)
* BEAZER HOMES USA (BZH)

And finally, here is a list of the top StarMine Equity Score by each sector, so I’m guessing you’ll see inflows into each of these:

Comm. Serv.

* 8.7 LUMN Lumen

Cons. Disc.

* 10.0 ASO Academy

Cons. Stap.

* 9.8 BG Bunge 

Energy

* 9.2 DVN Devon Energy

Financials

* 10.0 SF Stifel Financial 

Health Care

* 9.8 HOLX Hologic 

Industrials

* 10.0 ATKR Atkore

Info. Tech.

* 10.0 LOGI Logitech

Materials

* 9.7 Tronox

Real Estate

* 9.8 IIPR Innovative Ind Properties

Utilities

* 8.7 AY Atlantica

Obviously this is just a starting point for capturing the mainstream money, but I think there are some good buys here if you want to add value stocks. Or you could throw a dart and pick any of about 30 financial stocks that are universally rated buy. My picks are: 

* ROYAL CANADIAN (RY, 9.4 StarMine, 11 P/E)
* CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK (CM, 9.4 StarMine, 10 P/E)
* ENSTAR GROUP (ESGR, 10.0 StarMine, 3 P/E)
* VIRTU (VIRT, 9.9 StarMine, 5 P/E)

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6jrNrarWo&amp;t=47s&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) from one month ago shows the RKT CEO saying ""Between myself, our founder Dan Gilbert, and our leadership team, we own 95% of Rocket Companies."" So from this I thought that insider ownership would be 95%, however it is listed as [1.61%](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=rkt) on Finviz and N/A on [Fidelity](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbols=RKT) with everything else adding up to 100.2%. There are no listings of insiders having sold ever. Intitutional ownship is 73.8% according to Finviz and 72.6% on Fidelity. Ignoring ownership from any other entity, what am I missing here? Are the outstanding shares the 5% left over that insiders don't own, and the 1.61% is the portion of shares released that insiders have bought back?

Edit: After more research, Rocket holdings, their parent company, is still holding nearly 1.9B shares. Should they dump them tomorrow the price would plummet, so it seems everyone is operating on the faith that ownership will hold. However when they ipo’d it was supposed to be a 150M share offering, 50% more than were actually offered. So I wouldn’t be surprised if those were sold off at some point.

Call me old-fashioned, but I love me a good toy store. With the closest idea to a ""toy store"" in 2021 being our local target/walmart toy section, I was thinking back to the old days of Toys R US and KB Toys and thought what else is out there?? Father of 4...and our oldest was fortunate enough to experience the Toys R US days..the only option that gave a dismal experience of the past is our Build A Bear Workshop located in a mall about 25 miles away. The kids got 4 bears, clothes, and a little cardboard box that doubled as a ""house"" for the bear, averaging about $50 a bear (didn't mind since I factored in paying for the ""experience"")

Looking through the awesomeness of Jan 2021, Build A Bear Workshop ticker $BBW (let's try and be professional)...seemed to ride the momentum of the other BB's in the market. 

**Now the $$ and details I want to highlight. Take them with a grain of salt, just calling what I see:**

* On Jan 21st $BBW closed at 42% higher at $6.78 vs a prior day close of $4.77. 
* After dropping briefly, the stock continued and continues to be in an uptrend (the same cannot be said for some others out there)
* Trading off less than 500,000 in volume on a good day the stock was able to reach a 52wk high of $8.40 in Feb...could be the hype of everything going on, but there could be more there

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes from the ICR Conference and my personal views:**

* Reorganized swiftly during the pandemic
* Cutting OpX was in focus
   * 99% of lease agreements were re-negotiated
   * Employees furloughed 
   * Margins for 4Q20 seem flat (on the high end), but are based on lower Revenue (okay by me, the outlook looks great)
      * On the high end (they used mid-point) /  10.1% 4Q20 EBITDA Margin vs 10.4% in 4Q19
      * Prudent spend management I think is a more than fair statement
      * Net YoY change in Cash is looking like +$10M
* Shift to digital and e-commerce in focus
   * Pretty awesome website and they have a new CRM in place (don't know which) but they are making an effort
   * Licensing brands is a huge plus, especially with Disney movies coming out. They are currently doing a Peeps theme collection for Easter (genius). ALSO some of the collections/characters like Mew from Pokemon are pretty rare...5X in resale..pretty wild
* 8.8M bonus club subscribers (started in May 2019) 
   * 8.8M x $50 a bear...$440M in the pipe for the highly optimistic... that is possible?
   * I would like to see the growth potential of this base (they take a lot of polling of these metrics)
* **This is all with the pandemic in play and 18% decrease in operating days in retail stores and anticipating some full closures internationally like in the UK which had stores closed in Jan 2021**

We know that an ETF like VOO has always had overall growth over the decades. Do you feel that these ETF's will grow overall over the next decade?

I'm 22 and interested in passive long-term investing by dollar-cost averaging (though I'm open to lump sum, but am reluctant at the moment since the market is at an all time high!). The problem is, I've realized that investing purely in the VOO (which has an average return of 8%) will mean that I won't really be able to enjoy my wealth until I'm like 60, and given my age, I'm open to accepting a little bit of risk. So, I'm trying to increase the return rate on my Portfolio by investing about 20 of it into these riskier stocks that I expect to do well.

But are they any more likely than VOO not recover from a crash? Or do you think that with patience, they'll eventually steadily climb higher over the course of a decade? I realise no one truly has the answer to this question, but I'm basically asking about the predictability of long term growth (over, say, 5 - 10 years), as while I have some degree of risk tolerance, I don't want to gamble too much. If they crashed, I definitely wouldn't sell - but that's only if I'm confident they will actually go back up eventually.

Perhaps more importantly though: do you guys have a method or principle for knowing when to eventually sell these things? I'd like to reinvest any profit I make from risky ETF's into VOO after 5 - 10 years, or other medium-risk ETF's that seem more promising in the future.

Just don't want to be throwing my money into these every month if there's a chance they'll stay down in the long-term after a crash - but if things do work out, how should I know when to sell?

Also, do you think it might be more effective just to invest 100% of my portfolio into something like VOO?

After opening the day higher, stocks pulled back throughout the session to finish in the red, closing out a very volatile week in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.17% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.44% down, and the Dow (DIA) closed 0.03% down. Even though the major indexes pulled back this week, they continue to hover near record levels as optimism over additional stimulus continues to fuel higher levels of risk tolerance among market participants. 

There are many encouraging developments surrounding the coronavirus. This week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago, according to data analyzed by the New York Times. Furthermore, [analysis from Bloomberg on Thursday ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/how-many-vaccine-doses-are-available-u-s-should-see-a-surge?srnd=premium)showed that the U.S. vaccine supply is poised to double from the current rate of 10 million to 15 million doses per week within the next few weeks, allowing more shots to be given in the near-term.

Thursday night, in an interview with CNBC, Treasury Secretary Yellen said a large stimulus package is still necessary to build up sufficient momentum for economic recovery to take off on its own. She said, “We think it’s very important to have a big package \[that\] addresses the pain this has caused – 15 million Americans behind on their rent, 24 million adults and 12 million children who don’t have enough to eat, small businesses failing. I think the price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big. We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run,” she added.” 

Despite a record low supply and a temporary pullback in December, the housing market remains very strong. According to a report by the National Association of Realtors, sales ended the month of January at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 6.69 million units. That figure is 0.6 higher than December and 23.7% higher when compared with January 2020 and the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.

Unless you bought penny stocks, your investments should be fine if you were planning to hold long. If you are down large on a reputable company, dont sell in fear. Look at the 2015-16 stock market selloff.
Look at your investments during that period. It likely looks like a small dip followed by further increase in stock price up until March 2020 then more upward movement. This is the cycle.

If the stocks/companies you invested in didnt have a huge change in business (leadership change, market impacting legislature, bankruptcy, or anything catastrophic), the prices will come back. Of course do your due diligence. Every retail stock company has expert analysis and opinions regarding most stocks. Make sure you read those as these people are typically very much in the know of the industry and the market.

psychotrader00,0.0,36.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 3, 2021**

Stocks fell for the second straight day, with technology stocks dropping sharply as the Treasury yield ticked higher once again. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.7%, the second consecutive decline for the tech-heavy index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better, edging down 0.4%.

President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate. As a reminder, over the weekend, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single dose vaccine received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the third coronavirus vaccine available in the US, following Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced it was going to help Johnson &amp; Johnson produce its coronavirus vaccine. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with a simple majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate—plus a Democratic vice president—reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president’s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it

The likelihood of more stimulus and widespread business reopenings as the vaccine is distributewd has raised the specter of both speedy growth in the U.S. economy and rising inflationary pressures. Last week's jump in Treasury yields – with the benchmark 10-year yield reaching a one-year high of 1.61% – remains fresh in the minds of investors, who have been eyeing the rise in interest rates as a possible hindrance to the recovery and deviation from last year's ultra-low borrowing costs backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield currently sits at 1.48% at the time of writing.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-25-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set for mixed open after another major comeback

&gt; * Dow futures hold on to slim gains Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average wiped out a 110-point loss and climbed 424 points, or 1.4%, to a record closing high. S&amp;P and Nasdaq futures dropped in the premarket. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Wednesday erased a 1.3% drop and closed 1% higher. The S&amp;P 500 finished 1.1% higher after recovering from a 0.6% decline. Two days of reassuring words on interest rates and inflation from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell helped push stocks higher and tempered bond yield gains Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield on Thursday rose to 1.45%, around the highest levels in a year. B/itcoin rose 2% early Thursday, back above $50,000.

*****

&gt; # 2. Jobless, GDP, durable goods data all out before the bell

&gt; * The government is set to release weekly jobless claims, revised fourth quarter gross domestic product and January durable goods orders at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect a drop in new filings for unemployment benefits to 845,000. GDP in Q4 is seen rising slightly from the initial estimate to a 4.2% annual growth rate. Forecasts call for a 1% rise in durable goods orders last month, double December’s increase.

*****

&gt; # 3. GameStop shares surge again as Reddit favorites rally again

&gt; * GameStop climbed more than 70% in Thursday’s premarket trading as heavily-shorted stocks favored by Reddit traders surged again. Shares of the video game retailer doubled Wednesday to nearly $92 each after Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell resigned. The GameStop frenzy last month sent shares skyrocketing, causing a short-squeeze on a number of Wall Street hedge funds. GameStop traded below $20 per share in early January, before soaring to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28, a surge of more than 2,300%. The stock crashed below $50 by mid-February before Wednesday’s spike higher.

*****

&gt; # 4. Pfizer, Moderna work on shots against strain first discovered in South Africa

&gt; * Pfizer and BioNTech said on Thursday they’re testing a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine to better understand the immune response against new variants of the coronavirus. They are also in talks with regulatory authorities about testing a vaccine modified to protect specifically against the new variant originally found in South Africa.

&gt; * Moderna has shipped to the National Institutes of Health doses of a new Covid-19 vaccine designed to provide better protection against the variant spreading in South Africa. The new vaccine is ready to be tested in an early stage clinical trial to determine if it can be used as a booster shot against the highly transmissible strain.

*****

&gt; # 5. GOP rallies against Democrats’ Covid relief package

&gt; * Republicans rallied solidly against Democrats’ proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill as lawmakers awaited a decision by the Senate’s parliamentarian that could bolster or potentially kill a pivotal provision hiking the federal minimum wage. Despite narrow majorities on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders were poised to push the sweeping package through the House on Friday. They were hoping the Senate, where changes seem likely, would follow quickly enough to have legislation on President Joe Biden’s desk by mid-March.

Reasoning: Big market correction on the speculative tech and EV stocks, but still a good sector to invest in, lots of people may have got scared yesterday and looking to get into steadier positions. That one popular EV stock that cannot be named and is is all over the news, but a little risky after a huge drop recently, is garnishing even more attention to EV. The Biden administration seems to be doubling down on EV and green energy.... 

And here sits old man Ford. One of America’s oldest and well known companies, currently in a major pivot to EV with an awesome lineup (FUCKIN BRONCO yes please), sitting around $11-12 a share.....",stocks,F in the Chat,30.0,0.77
Kingmaker251,0.0,36.0,"TLDR: EV in the next 10 years is going to become the biggest industry in the world, not because of it's green energy but because of automation. They're going to lead to the largest mass unemployment rise as they make drivers unnecessary

I'd love people's opinions about my take on the future of EV and whether I'm off base or too optimistic

Disclaimer: In NIO for 140 shares @ $22

My main argument: EV companies are currently amazon in their bookshop phase

I would argue that the valuations of both TSLA, NIO and other large EV companies is seriously undervalued - I'm not basing this on the number of cars they manufacture nor the effectiveness of their electric battery potential but on the billions they're investing in the development of full self driving automation.

In the next 10 years, we are likely to see full automation especially with the advent of quantum computing leading to a huge increase in computational power ([https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023)) - The companies that are heavily investing in developing this technology aren't the classic car manufactures such as GM, Chevrolet or Chrysler but instead the large EV companies that have grown exponentially in the past year. Like many people I'm viewing companies like NIO or TSLA as tech companies and not car manufacturers. They're main value is in the code they develop for automation.

Once full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.

The main example I've been using for this is Domino's Pizza in the UK - They have about 1126 stores in the UK, let's say they conservatively they hire 5 delivery drivers per store and those drivers on average work about 5 days a week and a total of 6 hours per day (the three hours around lunch and three around dinner) - Let's also assume they only get paid minimum wage - This comes out to a total expenditure of about £80mill per year ($110 mill) for dominoes just based on paying their drivers wages, not countering in fuel or other expenditures that they do also cover - And that's only one company in the UK.

If automation occurs, which again these companies are investing heavily in and the underlying infrastructure and technology is beginning to reach basic requirements, these EV companies can create a code as service model along with the profit from actually selling the car and basically make drivers redundant

My argument is that basically at the moment these EV companies are amazon in their bookshop phase, people are betting that they'll sell lots of books (cars in this case because they're clean energy) and I think they're going to end up becoming juggernauts that basically take over our daily lives to the same extent amazon now does

Obvs I might be wrong and in fact I'd love to hear some bearish arguments - I'm not saying we're not in a bubble but I think these companies in 10 years time will be steals at their current prices",stocks,EV isn't the bubble we think it is,36.0,0.78
elvita12345,0.0,37.0,"I’ve done a lot of DD into these under-$10B stocks in the past few weeks and believe they’re undervalued relative to industry tailwinds, revenue growth, EPS growth and strength of their balance sheets.

•	⁠APPS. $7.3B market cap, growing revenue at over 100% per quarter, recently turned profitable and they have a powerful moat in the space they’re operating in. Concerns raised include quality and morality of management and the ethics of some parts of their business model.

•	⁠CRSR. $3.73B market cap. Criminally undervalued at the moment, IMO. Solid balance sheet, 70% rev growth, cash flow positive (recently paid down a bunch of debt), profitable, founder-LED. This thing should be trading way way higher than where it is right now.

•	⁠AEYE. $407M market cap. Operating in a niche industry with solid growth prospects. 90%+ rev growth, planning to turn cash flow positive this year, working solidly towards profitability, strong balance sheet and great customer growth. Just a solid business all around. Also, high insider ownership and low institutional ownership, which could be really good if management can execute.

•	⁠MWK. $1.36B market cap. Working on an innovative business model focused on e commerce, AI and consumer goods. 40%+ rev growth and on the brink of becoming profitable (high chances of them posting a profit next ER). Market is valuing them as a consumer goods company, but their tech, scalability and potential is being misunderstood IMO. Led by a smart and visionary founder.

•	⁠GRWG. $3B market cap. An indirect, less speculative way to get into the cannabis industry. They’re selling the shovels for the gold rush. Scaling extremely fast and effectively, aggressively buying up their competition and consolidating the market. They also have a burgeoning e commerce component. Rev growth is 100%+, management is confident in their continuous strong growth and recently raised guidance for 2021. They’re profitable, flush with cash and have a beautiful balance sheet. Only concern is the shady management team, but it hasn’t posed a problem so far.

•	⁠GAN. $1.03B market cap. Again, another way to bet in a less-risky fashion on a growing but high-risk industry (online gambling). They’re a SaaS company selling the solution for physical casinos to take their business online to compete with DKNG and other digital players. 86% rev growth, tons of recurring revenue, very strong balance sheet. They’re not cash flow positive or profitable yet, but management is confident in high EPS and rev growth for the next 5 years and the CEO seems really capable. They’re uniquely positioned to profit on industry trends and growth IMO.

•	⁠VITL. $1.17B market cap. Probably the less sexy out of all these picks, but also one of the most attractive when it comes to fundamentals. They’re a B Corp focused on ethically producing pasture raised eggs and butter (they’ll probably expand their catalogue into other dairy products soon). AMZN indirectly owns a small stake in them (5% of the company). Their marketing is exceptional and revenue growth has been phenomenal so far at 57%+, although slowing down. They’re profitable, cash flow positive and have the best balance sheet out of all these stocks. Leadership is also awesome and employee moral apparently is really high. The founder of the company still acts as Chairman and has a prominent role in the direction of the company. Only con is that their TAM isn’t really large, so growth is capped unless they go international. Still a great buy right now IMO.

•	⁠CURI. $1.08B market cap. Operating in the massive and still growing digital and video streaming space. They produce their own content in a niche space which is far cheaper to produce for than other type of video content (which allows them to price the service very cheaply compared to alternatives and still generate a profit). 80%+ revenue growth and management has consistently reiterated and raised guidance signaling growth can be sustained for a few years at least. They have a valuable library of content that’s growing rapidly, a good balance sheet, and although not cash flow positive or profitable yet, the growth easily offsets this in this particular business model in which scaling and producing content is way more important IMO. They’re one of the most heftily valued of these picks, but still solid and undervalued because of what they’re doing. Management is very solid, it’s founder LED and leadership has a lot of experience in the niche content they’re producing and that industry. Could easily see them growing the company ten-fold before being acquired by a big player or becoming a top dog themselves. As a footnote, the massive dip today provides a great buying opportunity.

mlsbbe,0.0,30.0,"Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.

I now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.

Now, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?

Basically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What’s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.

Basically, it’s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.

I went to bed pissed off and I’ve woken up even more pissed off. I dabble a bit in stocks and eToro completely shut me out of buying the dip and now I wake to every currency I hold back up by at least double figures. 

It’s now time for us to stop complaining and actually do something about eToro’s corruption and manipulation of us. 

So I spent 5 hours before I went to bed writing emails of complaint. I’m in the U.K. and have raised official complaints to the U.K. SEC, the department of trade, the financial ombudsman, my local MP, the minister for finance, the trade secretary, the SIA and GSI, the financial audit authority, the home office, the US trade envoy to the U.K., the US Embassy in London, The Ambassador, and about 10 other high level individuals who are involved in stock and shares and trading platforms. I also copied in Yoni the CEO of eToro so he can see how unhappy I am. With permission I also copied in my 3 friends who happened to be lawyers. 

I also emailed to the USA as well but I’m not as informed on your processes. So I email the US SEC, the U.K. Ambassador to Washington DC, the FTC and various high ranking members, the fraud department within the FBI, and small business department within the FBI, the anti trust department Commissioner, the financial ombudsman and the Chairman of internet financial services. A few others too who I don’t remember off the top of my head. 

I am taking this serious. I collected about 250 pieces of evidence on eToro trading manipulation. My lawyers will file in the most appropriate way and I will go to court. 

I have an idea we could do a class action lawsuit but then actions speak louder than words. By that I mean people like to complain but do nothing about it. They can’t even be bother to change platforms. 

If you feel we should do a class action lawsuit you have to be committed and have proof how eToro manipulated your trading. So over the next two to four weeks I’ll be seeing where we stand. 

If you wish to join me, whether in the U.K. or USA to start with please just email your name and address so my lawyers can register interest as to whether we do have the chance of doing a large group class action. 

Thanks for reading and please let me know your thoughts. Mine of course are FUCK ETORO. 

Best wishes,

Martin

Last Friday I posted a discussion of the week ending Finviz heat map ([link](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lobfjy/this_is_why_you_pay_attention_to_red_days_because/)), where I discussed that what I thought I was seeing last week was an uptick in the rotation into energy, mining &amp; minerals, commodities, financials as money was beign moved out of the mega-cap and large-cap ""pandemic stocks"" that got so big (overvalued) in 2020. You can see this visually in [this heat map of last Friday's trading](https://i.imgur.com/VZAXcd7.png), which reveals what people were buying (and in some cases, still selling) after a lot of people took profits in mid-week last week. 

This is a quick update and follow up of my post last Friday. 

**2020 winners continue to sell off as the end of Q1 2021 approaches**

The trend of selling off stocks that did well in 2020, and especially in the first 3 quarters of 2020, and rotating into smaller stocks and away from consumer defensive, work from home and other pandemic stocks, seems to be continuing. [Here's a finviz.com heat map after close of trading today, Wednesday Feb 24](https://imgur.com/SFED2aK),showing more green than red but roughly the same trend as last week's trading. 

The arguments I made in my post last Friday still hold, in my opinion. The transition from pandemic 2020 portfolios, which were largely consumer defensive, work from home, tech and other coronavirus restriction stocks, as well as high-stakes speculative trades, has started to occur and should continue either steadily or periodically into March. It's my feeling that these selloffs followed by rotations into new (recovery/rebound) investments will accelerate into the end of March when funds and pensions have to rebalance their portfolios, take profits, and position themselves for the rest of 2021 at the end of Q1 2021. 

An example of this trend is where Cathie Woods' ARK Invest funds in the past few weeks, which are full of high-growth meme stocks of 2020, have been hit by a sell-off this week. The selloff in Ark follows a few weeks of ARK funds underperforming competitors' actively managed funds and ETFs for innovation/tech stocks. The underperformance of the ARK funds vs competitors suggests that investors have been buying other innovation funds while selling ARK Invest (and the stocks ARK holds). An alternative explanation for the recent relative underperformance of the ARK funds could be that the drop in TSLA and a few overpriced stocks are starting to drag it down. Here are some reference charts for ARK funds underperforming other funds:

* [ARK funds vs PSCE (small cap energy ETF), IEP (Icahn's industrial fund) &amp; PICK (minerals &amp; mining ETF)](https://imgur.com/z1spO52)  
* [ARK funds vs KRE (regional banking ETF), XLE (energy ETF) &amp; IEP (Icahn's industrial fund)](https://imgur.com/CJAla9S)   
* I already posted charts of ARK funds underperforming some other innovation tech ETFs in the past couple weeks in the post linked above. 

You might ask, Why would people be slowing buying into ARK funds in the past few weeks if they've been so successful, or worse, dumping ARK funds? Three reasons: 

1. ARK funds have seen massive inflows for its investing/business model, which is to have a limited portfolio of small growth companies. An ETF company can only pour so many billions into the same few dozen companies before they get overvalued and become the target of short sellers and other investors stop buying those stocks. Cathie has been flogging that same team of horses well past the finish line, continuing to acquire already-overvalued stocks to add to her fund portfolios (TSLA, PLTR, DKNG). This is a structural challenge to her small-portfolios-of-companies business model. 

2. Some of the meme stocks in her portfolios that are considered overvalued are themselves not doing so well lately, including her signature holding, TSLA. To a great extent, some ARK funds are just [diluted versions of TSLA](https://imgur.com/v7irVCD) with [a little relatively microscopic extra growth potential here and there that you can notice occasionally when TSLA starts dropping very quickly](https://imgur.com/ICVQw7g). The fact that the ARK funds are dependent upon the continued outperformance of some very overvalued stocks is multiplied by the ability of a certain well known tycoon to pump up the value of his company with high-volatility moves such as [buying billions of dollars worth of bitcoin, thereby linking his company's stock to bitcoin's volatility to some extent](https://observer.com/2021/02/tesla-stock-bitoin-tumble-elon-musk-net-worth-fall-billion/). While some might like that, other investors avoid too much complicated volatility and would take that as a signal to exit the stock and the ARK funds. The fact that Cathie Woods cut some other positions to allocate more money into making massive TSLA buys today, punching up the stock's value, suggests that the dependence of ARK funds on TSLA's performance may be an existential issue at this point. 

3. There probably just are greener fields to invest in right now than highly leveraged, no-positive earnings growth stocks, and these have fallen slightly in status because of inflation rearing its head. I feel that inflation is  probably a *catalyst* that galvanized institutional and professional investors to take this time to take profits on what worked well in 2020 and switch to other investments that do better during periods of high inflation, as those other stocks and assets will see some good gains (at least in the near term). Those other investments would be the energy, commodity, mining, financials, transportation, (certain) industrial stocks and real estate related stocks that are represented by XLE, PICK, IEP, KRE in the charts linked above. 

So Buy This, Not That: Inflation Edition would look at where the money is going out of the assets that have been seeing accelerated selling, particularly in the past couple of weeks, and that would be these other sectors that have been seeing cash inflows. And those smaller/midcap stocks and sectors are green on these heat maps. 

**Small companies not consistently outperforming this week as they have been previously**

Last week in the post I linked at top, I pointed out that because a lot of the mega caps and large caps had become flooded with investor cash, and are in fact many of the ""pandemic stocks"" that did well during lockdowns during 2020 (work from home stocks, tech stocks, consumer defensive/staples, etc), money that had been avoiding overvalued stocks had been going into small caps. The small cap versions of the sector ETFs that I looked at had done about 2x better than the versions that were large-cap or market cap weighted. That's not necessarily the case for inflation week (this week). Why? Because small cap stocks tend to need more debt, and need to pay higher interest on their debt, which comes hand in hand with their growth potential. So until the hunt for value in terms of low P/E resumes, small cap is no longer a blanket under which to cuddle for better returns this Spring, in my opinion, but it remains the place where value is found for picking individual stocks where you can screen stocks for low price/debt ratio and low long term debt.  

**How does inflation fear change how we screen stocks?**

Firstly, the stocks that do worse during times of inflation are not that different from people who do worse: if you have a lot of credit card debt and loans, and not a lot of cash coming in, you're not doing as well when inflation is high. Companies with high price/debt ratios, low long term debt, high free cash flow and strong balance sheets/assets are suddenly more popular this week than disruptor companies with no profits, not a lot of cash incoming and expectations of future growth propping up their value with intangibles like futuristic tech offerings. 

So this week, I've added a few steps to my review of new stocks, and I'm also going back and reviewing my own stocks by comparing them to their peers based on what I'm calling their ""financial moat"" vs inflation/high inflation:

* price/debt ratio  
* low (or better yet, no) long term debt  
* high free cash flow  

Then there are concerns of companies being more sensitive to downturn risk, and these are the same considerations as value investors apply. This is a little different than just cashflow and debt

* other financials like p/e can give a sense of value  
* strong technical/capital equipment moat in their industry/niche  
* lack of governance, legal or technical problems that caused them to be ""good values"" (i.e. the companies are not actually good values but have low prices because they have been run badly)   

These ""financial moat"" vs inflation considerations might overlap with how people judge ""value stocks"" and ""dividend paying stocks"" because both value stocks and dividend paying stocks have some of these attributes in order to be considered good values, and to pay high dividends. But that doesn't mean it's safe to just substitute value stocks and high dividend paying stocks as classes of stocks that will be sure to blanket do well. There are so-called ""value stocks"" that are just low p/e because they happen to suck and there are high dividend paying stocks because they're able to get low interest rate loans right now to maintain their dividends during a tough time (like AT&amp;T and XOM). 

So in my personal opinion it's wise to avoid just going with what some financial advisors and writers are saying, which is that value stocks and high dividend paying stocks are popular right now/this week, and not overlooking the detail: that maybe it's that the stocks that pass some inflation ""financial moat"" evaluations that are doing well and most of the time these are also value stocks and high dividend paying stocks (and not vice versa). So I'm not skipping the debt and free cash flow checks anymore, even in looking at value and dividend stocks. 

So my ""Buy This, Not That"" thought for this week is to maybe add to your DD checking the stocks for a good financial moat vs inflation (the checks I mentioned above) and maybe thinking twice about taking on stocks that have debt, cashflow, leverage, and other interest-rate vulnerable problems. It might be a good time to avoid pandemic stocks that did well in 2020 and look to new sectors and industries, as well as staying away from any stocks that are overvalued. 

tldr; inflation fears lead me to adjust my approach a bit, updating my Friday 02/24/21 post on rotating out of pandemic stocks, by adding checking for debt, free cashflow, value and some other factors to harden the companies against rising interest rates, and these changes to my approach also help me understand why some of my stocks this week have done better than others.

Do you think next week this stock will pump or tank next week ? 29 is a good entry point ?",stocks,PLTR long term investment,30.0,0.72

**Company – What they do**

Perion Network Ltd. $PERI is a global technology company based in Israel and listed on NASDAQ  that is in the business of digital advertising. Company's diversified  business model includes products and services that are used across the  three main pillars of digital advertising, which are:

1. Search
2. Social display ads
3. Video (display advertising)

The  other important thing to remember is that Google , Facebook  tend to  through their weight around, as they control 85% of ad spend. This means  brands, advertisers, and publishers tend to look for friendlier and  flexible alternatives that respect their brands and need for  monetization.

Their main competitors/peers are The Trade Desk ($TTD) and Magnite (MGNI).

**Market**

Digital  advertising is a 20% yoy growing market which is estimated to value 542  billion dollars in 2024 divided in the 3 main segments:

1. Search Ad: $211B
2. Social display ads: $157B
3. Video (display advertising): $173B

Perion’s  main business until 3 years ago was the low margin and slow growth “ad  search channel” and this was the reason of the low multiples applied to  the stock price; in the last 2 years it is on a turnaround path and  through integration of their systems as well as acquisition of companies  such as ContentIQ and Pub Ocean it is starting now to deliver, just when the digital advertising  industry is showing signs of stability after suffering one of huge  downturns due to COVID-19.

**Financials and Valuation**

[https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perion-IR-deck-11022021.pdf](https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perion-IR-deck-11022021.pdf)

PERI has a strong balance sheet with $113M in cash ($3.5/share in cash) and $8M debt.

&amp;#x200B;

||EV/revenues|EV/EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PERI|2|18|
|MGNI|23|114|
|TTD|36|114|

&amp;#x200B;

PERI  had $328M revenue in 2020 and an EV of 643M. It is trading for an  EV/Revenue = 2. To give a comparison, The Trade Desk ($TTD) is valued 36  EV/Revenue, Magnite ($MGNI) 23 EV/Revenue. Even considering other  competitors, the average EV/Rev for the sector is 13 while PERI is  trading at 1/7 of peers.

If we  consider the EV/EBITDA, PERI is trading at 18 EV/EBITDA while the main  competitors (MGNI and TTD) are valued 114 EV/EBITDA and average for the  sector is 56 EV/EBITDA. (69$ per share following this metric)

Now,  the reason for this big difference in multiples is the fact that the  market still sees PERI mainly as an ad search company with limited  growth: MGNI and TTD will have a growth of 30% next year. What about  PERI with their AD Search stagnant revenues ? the company moved on developing the video and social ad segments in last 2 years. Let’s have a look at 2020 revenues :

Revenues from Search AD: $179.4 M +3% yoy (low growth as expected)

`Revenues from Display and Social $AD: 148.7M, +69% yoy`(So Display and Social segment showed a +70% growth despite covid19.!)

Recently  MGNI acquired SpotX (company specialized only in CTV and Video ads) for  $1.17 billion or 10x SpotX revenues ($ 116M). To give an idea, PERI  revenues in Display and Social are 148.7M as we will see below. So based  on this real “market benchmark”, PERI Video and Social segment (even  ignoring the AD Search) should be worth $ 1.5 billion (so $46/share). By  adding the Search AD we are still near north of $60/share valuation.

In  short, PERI stock price should be valued north of 60$ per share based  on the valuation of other companies in the market. Considering it is  trading at 2x revenues, it is cheap not only in comparison of other  companies but also on an stand alone valuation.

Company  provided a very conservative guidance (+10% for 2021) but as they did  in previous years, management prefers to set a low guidance and then  rise it during the year. Considering the growth of revenues in 2020  despite covid, it should be easy to meet at least a 15/20% growth in  2021 in a market that is foreseen for rising in the next years.

**Risks**

A  huge recession or a new wave of COVID19 by impacting the ads market as a  whole would probably impact 2021 guidance. In addition, the Search Ad  segment is much dependent from their 4 years deal with Microsoft.

Perhaps  the biggest threat is competition. PERI operates in the highly  competitive ad tech industry which is constantly evolving. Failure to  consistently innovate could lead to market share losses.

**Final Summary**

PERI  is a severely undervalued company which has successfully turned around  focusing on Video and Social ads. It is still a “show me” story where  the company has to confirm the growth reached in 2020 despite covid19.

Considering  its peers as well as any metric, price target should be **$45 by year end  (+100% upside**) if they respect management guidance in a conservative  scenario and could be **&gt;60$ if they beat guidance (as they did in last  years)**.

Thedudeabides86,0.0,29.0,"GTHX – G1 Therapeutics

**PDUFA approval** was given after market on Friday, stock has risen 20% to end after market trading. There is a chance for some gains tomorrow/this week. Now I know the whole short squeeze thing is overplayed and tacky, but this one actually has a chance to generate some solid upward movement.


There is a 20% short interest on GTHX right now at a cost of around $30.00. The stock ended after hours at $37.00 +. If the stock ends Wednesday above $40.00 these shorts will be forced to cover. This wont have any effect like GME/AMC etc but its definitely worth noting. For what it’s worth I hate myself for having to write that because everyone claims short squeeze now, but with this massive catalyst this has some potential on top of already existing potential of the approval and the drug.


**INTRO TO G1**
G1 Therapeutics is focused primarily on developing Trilaciclib, Rather than trying to kill cancer cells directly, like chemotherapy or radiation, or indirectly, like immunotherapies, Trilaciclib works to mitigate the harm of these therapies to non-cancer cells which can increase the effectiveness of treatment in a number of ways. The drug is current approved for treating small cell lung cancer only however they are currently in trials for colorectal, breast and bladder cancer.


Using Trilaciclib could help patients be able to stay on an ideal chemo regimen when they otherwise couldn’t, thus giving them the greatest possible chance of seeing effectiveness. Trilaciclib has also increased T-cell counts around the tumors in some of its trials, so it’s conceivable that preserving these immune cells could allow for more of a direct anti-tumor response by the immune system.


**POTENTIAL SALES**
G1 has said it views likely peak sales for trilaciclib in SCLC as between $500 million and $750 million. 

The low end peak sales expectations for trilaciclib in lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer are a combined $1.6 billion.


**PIPELINE**
G1 also just launched a Phase 2 trial in neoadjuvant breast cancer in Q2 2020, and we won’t see data from that trial until 2023. Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the final indication in the pipeline for trilaciclib at present. G1 has said that a Phase 3 should be initiated later this month in Q4 2020 in mCRC. Similar to the neoadjuvant breast cancer trial, mCRC data is expected sometime in 2023. These are also large potential markets with estimates I’ve seen for mTNBC around $500 million and for mCRC around $600 million.
Rintodestrant is an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). Approximately 65% of breast cancers rely on estrogen signaling for growth and survival, thus SERDs should be able to prevent much of this signaling from taking place which should then slow growth and improve survival. There is currently only one SERD therapy on the market, and it is an intramuscular injection that has to be given three times during the first month and once a month after that. Additional data is expected from the ongoing Phase 1/2a trial of rintodestrant in Q2 2021, and strong data could be needle-moving given that I’ve seen peak sales estimates for rintodestrant in breast cancer as high as $2.1 billion.

Lerociclib is the last therapy in the pipeline, and it is fully partnered out. G1 licensed the worldwide rights out to lerociclib to EQRx and Genor Biopharma for a $26 million upfront payment and up to $330 million in future milestones in addition to royalties on eventual sales.

**HIGHLIGHTS**
-	Approval for Trilaciclib for SCLC given late Friday, hasn’t been 
traded on yet, only after hours before a long weekend which had low volume

-	Expected sales for SCLC alone is 500-750 mil

-	Low end expected sales for Trilaciclib once if/ once approved for lung/breast/colon cancer would be 1.6 billion

-	Potential for small short squeeze action",stocks,GTHX - G1 Therapeutics - CATALYST,29.0,0.82
chugger93,0.0,33.0,"I'm 42 and I started investing about 6 months ago. Better late than never eh? My goal was long term growth, either for retirement or if ever I needed some additional funds. I have a mixed portfolio of single stocks and etf funds.  My portfolio is up about 2k, and I think it's important to note I've never sold anything.

This leads me to my question. A bunch of my stocks have had great and low results, obviously. I'm torn between taking the risk of selling some for profits and then hopefully waiting for a dip to rebuy. That seems like a perfect scenario, but I know it's a gamble. Is it a good gamble tho?

Maybe it's better to just keep buying/investing and not take that risk? I'm just looking to see if there's a general consensus on this strategy. Shrug. Ty

cheechuu,0.0,30.0,"The Food and Drug Administration said Friday evening it will “rapidly work” to authorize the Johnson &amp; Johnson single-shot coronavirus vaccine, shortly after an expert committee unanimously recommended the vaccine.


In a statement, the agency said it has notified the company and federal officials involved in vaccine distribution so that they can prepare to ship the vaccine shortly. The FDA may issue an emergency use authorization as soon as Saturday, with the first few million doses — of a shot that is relatively simple to store, handle and administer — distributed next week.

Healthy-Cash8610,0.0,30.0,"**1st point**: Recently did some research for a college course where I analyzed the Buffett Indicator. For those unfamiliar with the metric, it divides total stock market cap by current US GDP. According to Indicator, the market is overvalued higher than it ever has been. However, if you calculate the correlation between the 10-Year US Treasury bond and the Buffett Indicator over the last 50 years, they are negatively correlated with a coefficient of -.9 (-1 would be perfectly inversely related). Basically, when bond yields are low, the Buffett Indicator (and stock valuations) are higher. If you look at the data from the "".com"" bubble in 2000, bond interest rates were still at 6% (average for last 50 years) which means low yields weren't what was juicing the market. We are not in a similar situation as back then. Currently, bond yields are at all time lows and investors have no choice but to put money into stocks if they want a decent return. As low as rates remain at all time lows, the stock market isn't about to crash. 

**2nd point:** More stimulus checks are on the way. While there are many Americans that need this stimulus for everyday expenses, there are also millions of financially stable people who will be getting the stimulus even though that don't need it. Where do you think all this money will be going? If I had to bet it's mostly going into the stock market. 

**Summary** \- Quit listening to fear mongers talking like the market is about the crash. Even if it corrects 10%-20% we will be fine. The data backs this up. The best time to invest for the long term is and always will be right now. Get in the market and dollar-cost average is it starts to fall (which I don't see a major fall happening until bond rates increase significantly).

GhostOfSamurai,0.0,33.0,"First off, if you don't know who AbbVie is, they are a pharmaceutical company. You almost certainly 
have heard of some of their medications and treatments. Botox, Humira, and Imbruvica are the ones I 
already knew from commercials or popular culture before starting to follow AbbVie as a business. They 
have been around since 2013, after splitting from their parent company, Abbot Laboratories (Abbot Labs 
is also one of my long term picks but that's a DD for another day). In 2019, AbbVie acquired Allergan 
and with it came its profile of drug therapeutics, one of them being the well-known Botox. The acquisition 
completed on 5/8/2020. I currently have 2 open positions on ABBV but the plan is to buy 10 more tomorrow 
and continue buying additional shares each pay period from the day job.

Now, for the important stuff. Why I think this is a solid long term investment (for me not you, and **this is not investment advice**).

AbbVie's stock price has been mostly bullish for the last two years, with a couple pandemic dips 
it has recovered from. But fundamentally, things look promising once you factor the pandemic into the 
equation. Even though earnings were down from prior years, 2019 saw its 4 year peak earnings at 
**$7.9B**. If not for the pandemic it may have exceeded this, but 2020 still saw Abbvie take 
home a cool **$4.6B** in earnings. Revenues in 2020 were at their record 4 year high, bringing in **$45.8B** 
during the 2020 year. Earnings per share beat out the estimate in Q4 as well, at $2.92, maintaining
dividends at **$1.30 per share**. Since the company's inception in 2013, the dividend has increased 
by **225%**. Earlier this month, AbbVie is confident its pandemic impact in Q1 will be minimal and more 
controlled than its 2020 impact. It estimates a full-year profit of **$6.96** per share, while in 2020 
its full-year profit was $2.72 per share. 

Financials aside, AbbVie looks primed for success based on information from 2021 alone. AbbVie and Caribou 
are partnering up for the research and development of CAR-T cellular therapeutics. Existing CAR-T therapies 
have shown early promise in some cancer patients, but it seems AbbVie and Caribou are looking to tackle the 
issue of immune response to CAR-T therapies among other advancements. Solving the immune response issue 
however opens the door for the next generation of cellular therapies to benefit a wider range of patients. 

Additionally, Botox was approved on 2/10/21 by the FDA for use in treating pediatric detrusor (bladder muscle 
overactivity). This marks 12 therapeutic indications the FDA has now approved Botox for. And remember that 
acquisition of Allergan I mentioned above? Allergan has begun working on a bi-polar and depression treatment 
with it's psychedelic-derived VRAYLAR drug, though I could not find information on which psychedelic(s).
However, this is still important as the industry for psychedelic-derived therapies is ramping up, and is 
expected to boom with demand in the next five to seven years. This should net both Allergan and AbbVie 
nice returns on VRAYLAR, should it pass its clinical trials. VRAYLAR has already been approved for clinical 
trials by the FDA.

Now, there's been a lot of positive news saturating my feeds around AbbVie so I wasn't able to find any recent
negative fundamentals on them, aside from pandemic-related issues to the business which haven't been seen 
since Q2 2020. If I've gotten anything wrong or there's additional information that should be considered, 
feel free to comment to that effect. I'm always ready to learn and improve. I've included all sources for the 
information cited above.

EDIT: I somehow mis-noted the name of AbbVie's bipolar and depression drug as VYLAR, instead of it's correct name VRAYLAR. I corrected this above. It also appears this was approved by the FDA in 2015, so I'm not sure why Bloomberg stated the FDA approved it ""for testing"". See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ln07ho/abbv_abbvie_inc_is_a_solid_long_term_investment/go0vlvf/) for details and thanks /u/freya_gleamingstar for correcting me on the drug name.

rhetorical_twix,0.0,33.0,"So it looks as if a major spike in interest rates is upending the market. There are some reasons why this happens, and I'll include some notes below from some paywalled articles. But the main idea is that there is a rotation building up away from growth stocks into value stocks. That kind of rotation happens very rarely and can be accompanied by significant corrections of 10% or more. 

For some time, because of all the stimulus starting in 2020, people have been warning of inflation Of course, that's affected the market with rising commodity prices, rising bitcoin/ethereum/dogecoin pricing vs the dollar, and so on. But that was all happening in the context of predicting future inflation/future higher interest rates while enjoying low interest rates in the present due to Fed easing. There are a lot of articles on how rising interest rates can kill stock growth, and you can find those online. 

* This 02/18/21 Business Insider article covers some issues: [US stocks are on the verge of a correction as interest rates begin to rise, DataTrek says](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-correction-likely-interest-rates-begin-to-rise-2021-2-1030097824)

&gt; Interest rates have ticked higher in recent weeks, with the 10-year US Treasury Note jumping to 1.31% on Thursday from 0.91% at the start of the year. And even though the Fed has signaled that it does not foresee raising interest rates until 2023, Fed Funds Futures are beginning to signal that the Fed could begin increasing rates in 2022. ""The odds of a Fed policy shift next year has gone from 2% to something closer to 5% to 10%,"" Colas said. That doesn't represent the danger zone yet, ""but the trend is clearly not our friend,"" the note said.

&gt; As interest rates rise, it tends to put pressure on stock prices as the premium assigned to equities drops due to investors re-allocating their portfolios to higher yielding fixed income. Essentially, the bullish ""there is no alternative"" argument for stocks in a zero interest rate world begins to dissipate. And based on its analysis of previous bull markets, stocks could decline by 8% sometime in the next 4-6 weeks, DataTrek said.

Think of it this way: with practically zero interest rates AND inflation, conservative, retired and other investors would actually lose money sitting in low-volatility, slow growth value stocks, bonds and fixed income assets. That's because inflation would erode the value of their money faster than they could maintain it because of the low-interest environment. That means that everyone, even conservative and retired persons have to pile into growth stocks in order to not have inflation eating away at their portfolio.

However, once interest rates start to rise to match or exceed inflation, then they can go back to safer investments like bonds and other fixed-income assets, and low-volatility value stocks. These investors are more concerned with not losing money than making a lot more, so if there's a decent interest rate out there, they will jump ship from growth stocks to bonds &amp; value stocks. 

Because there was a big jump in interest rates this week, a big rush of money is coming out of growth stocks and piling into safer stuff. Also, we've had a big run-up in stock prices recently and these same investors, as well as some others, will be set to take profits. 

&gt; DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said that US stocks are due for a sell-off following a strong 20% rally in the S&amp;P 500 since the end of October.

* In this 02/18/21 CNBC Article, a 10-15% correction is predicted: [How the rapid run-up in interest rates could set off a 10% to 15% correction](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/how-the-rapid-run-up-in-interest-rates-could-set-off-a-10percent-to-15percent-correction.html)

&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.28% as stocks sold off, after trading as high as 1.31% earlier in the day. The yield was about 15 basis points – or 0.15% – lower in the middle of last week.

&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the stock market could be in the middle of a 10% to 15% correction, after the rapid run-up in interest rates that took the 10-year to fresh one-year highs.

Because the market has had a big run-up and is ""overbought"", the 200 day moving average might provide the bottom

&gt; “The market is sufficiently overbought that that spot may be closer to the 200-day moving average which is 3,418,” said Emanuel. He said the market will adjust to the higher yield, and the sell-off should create a buying opportunity. 

&gt; “It’s definitely a change in psychology that as we found, and rightly so, given the greater success of the vaccine and pretty reasonable prospects for the economy,” he said. “You’re seeing this shift away from growth and toward value stocks. That shift hardly ever occurs in the course of history in a non-volatile fashion.” 

This one market strategist says that the steep dive may be due to how fast interest rates moved, causing a stampede

&gt; Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said the stock market should not be reacting as much as it is to the current level of yields.

&gt; “It’s the pace of change, not the actual place we’ve gotten to that investors are worried about,” he said. “We think the yield on the 10-year will be between 1.5% and 2% by the end of the year. We just didn’t think it would be there by the end of this week.” 

Again, this isn't just due to rising interest rates, tho, or even interest rates rising very fast, but the fact that the market is already at highs and people were already poised with their fingers on the trigger to take profits:

&gt; “You shouldn’t freak out every time the yield on the 10-year goes up, thinking it’s the apocalypse because it’s not. We’re near an all-time high. To me this is an excuse to take profits,” Hogan said. The pullback could be as steep as 10% or more, he said.

The stocks that will be most affected are those with high growth multiples, i.e the opposite of value stocks:

&gt; “The shift higher and market psychology around what has been a rise in yields, not just in the U.S. but globally suggests at these valuations, the oversold market is going to have difficulty sustaining these levels in the near term, particularly for high-multiple growth stocks,” said Emanuel of BTIG.

This means that the heaviest incoming losses should be for high-PE stocks, like the overbought FAAMGs:

&gt; “That’s a source of pressure because as interest rates rise, the value of the discounted cash flow in these companies…decreases,” Emanuel said. “That wouldn’t be a problem at 15 or 20 times next year’s earnings, but for many companies, with 30, 40, 50 and upward times valuations, it’s a significant headwind in the near term.”

&gt; That would include a number of FAANG stocks. For instance, Facebook was down about 1.6% on Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m. ET. Netflix was nearly 0.9% lower and Alphabet was down 0.6%.

&gt; Other growth favorites Apple lost 1.7%, while Tesla was down 1.5%.

All of the above analysts that I quoted above stated that the long term equity growth picture is strong and that when the dust settles, this will be a buying opportunity.

Personally, this is a good time for me to rebalance my portfolio back to some value stocks that I had liked in 2020 but weren't doing anything because no one would put money into them. So right now, value stocks are on a growth arc, at least in the short term. Like a lot of other investors, I had swung away from value stocks completely in the past few months and can rebalance my portfolio. Growth stocks should pick up their growth again, but from a lower level after the selloff slows down. In the meantime, I think maybe I can catch some of the run-up in good value stocks that are seeing some inflows.",stocks,What's causing the stock dump &amp; how it impacts the investor,33.0,0.79

Originally not my DD, but I truely believe in it. (all credits to u[/3STmotivation](https://www.reddit.com/user/3STmotivation/) ). Next couple of months will be very interesting (bullish) for the uranium sector.

The last few months have been quite eventful for uranium investors, with shares of companies all across the sector appreciating in value substantially. There have been many reasons why this is the case and it feels different to just being strong seasonality. Below are 15 ‘first time’ things to look out for in this sector to start the year with, with full credit going to John Quakes (@quakes99 on Twitter), a retired earth sciences researcher, professor, analyst, writer and one of the best public sources for news about the uranium sector. I share his view that 2021 will prove to be an incredible year for the uranium sector and subsequently for anyone invested in it. Now, onto the aforementioned ‘first times’:

First time entering a new year with uranium already in a record supply deficit, which is set to deepen further with 2 major mines permanently closing this year in Australia and Niger (\~7 million pounds, gone). At the same time, demand for nuclear energy has remained strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to grow in a global shift to decarbonize industry dependent on fossil fuels.

First time that Cameco, the world’s 2nd largest producer, has begun a new year with every one of its uranium mines in Canada shut down. Both of the world’s 2 largest uranium mines are under care and maintenance, resulting in zero lbs being produced in Canada as we enter 2021. The US is also producing zero lbs while Kazakhstan’s production is at a multi-year low that is likely to continue thru 2022 under the nation’s current flex-down program and pandemic related mining disruptions. All uranium mines in the Ukraine have also been shut down due to the inability of the mine operator to pay the wages of 5000 mine workers.

Fist time that at least 3 of the world’s largest uranium producers are forced into buying uranium on the spot market. Cameco is now the largest spot market buyer in the world. World’s largest producer Kazatomprom is now also a spot buyer, as is French Orano given that heir Canadian mills are suspended and their Cominak mine in Africa is heading for closure in March. Inventory held by the world’s largest uranium producers is at rock bottom levels for the first time ever and in need of replenishment this year.

First time the US has taken steps to support its domestic uranium mining industry by establishing a strategic uranium reserve, a 10 year buying program (1.5 billion dollars total) whereby the US government will purchase, convert and potentially enrich US mined uranium to create an emergency supply for US reactors. Goal is to ensure at least 2 US uranium mining companies remain active and viable during this time when the commodity price of U3O8 is half the cost of production.

First time in several decades that there is strong bipartisan support in the US to rebuild the existing nuclear energy industry and manufacture a new generation of advanced reactors on a global scale, which is seen as a high priority in order to catch up with Russia and China who have become the new world leaders in nuclear energy.

First time that uranium equities have entered a bull market when there is an actual supply deficit. The last bull market saw the price of uranium skyrocket on mine floods and other events that created the ‘fear’ of a supply deficit on the horizon, at a time when the US-Russia Megatons to Megawatts program was still continuing to supply 20m lbs per year to US nuclear utilities, a program that continued until 2021 as the world’s largest virtual uranium mine.

First time that a new year begins with spot market supplies significantly depleted. Supply accessible to carry traders has been severely reduced. Kazatomprom no longer sells any lbs into the spot market and Orano’s supply from Canada and Niger is at a record low level, pushing nuclear utilities to secure new long term contracts with producers rather than entering into shorter term contracts with carry traders. Security of supply is a top priority of utilities (whose inventories are estimated to be around 2,5 years’ worth of supply, when the guideline is to never let it drop below 2-3 years given the long time it takes to enrich and deliver the fuel to the reactors).

First time that US and European nuclear utilities have begun a new year with inventories drawn down below usual safety margins at the same time that mines supply is in a record deficit and global uranium production is at its lowest level in 12 years. The new 2020 IAEA/NEA uranium Red Book projects that secondary supplies will fall in the future as an overdue utility inventory restocking cycle begins, due to higher levels of contracting, conversion and enrichment that will reduce underfeeding as facilities see their utilization rates rise.

First time in several years that there are no geopolitical overhangs holding back the uranium contracting plans of US and European nuclear utilities. There are no potential section 232 actions targeting uranium imports and no sanctions likely against UUN participants (Russia, China, UK, Germany, France) in the JCPOA Iran Nuclear deal. Russia and the US have successfully negotiated a 20-year extension to the Russian Suspension Agreement that will see the US imports from Russia decline over the coming 2 decades. The incoming US administration supports keeping nuclear power plants running and plans to immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, pushing for global net zero emissions by 2050, a process in which nuclear energy will play a major role.

First time that nations around the world will be recovering from a global pandemic with massive infrastructure spending programs that include boosting nuclear capacity to achieve net zero carbon emissions goals. A new ‘nuclear renaissance’ is beginning to take shape on pandemic recovery spending to boost clean energy. The perception of nuclear energy is also changing to that of a safe, reliable, necessary baseload power source that fits with an emerging ESG investing model. Decarbonization has become a new buzz word in the global vocabulary. The ‘electrification of everything’ from cars, buses, trucks and trains to major industry is the new global target. Sustainability of so-called renewables solar and wind is now being called into question after failures by Germany and California to successfully transition to an economy powered by intermittent energy sources. Higher electricity prices, no net carbon emissions reductions and rolling blackouts have demonstrated how ‘renewables’ are not able to fulfill their early promise. This might change with new battery technology and better implementation, but we are nowhere near that point yet.

First time that uranium stocks are entering a new year on the heels of one of their best performance years since the last bull market. The U3O8 spot price is still one-half the global average cost of production that will incentivize new mines to be built this decade. This signals to investors that we are still at the opening pitch of the first inning of a long game yet to play out. A necessary doubling of the U3O8 commodity price is yet to come.

First time that Canada has begun a new year embarking on a small modular reactors build-out program with several provinces pledging to deploy SMR’s to power remote communities, mines and industrial heat applications in the energy industry.

First time that nuclear is being viewed as the ideal carbon free high-temperature power source to produce clear hydrogen fuel. US, Russia, Japan and others are looking to leverage their existing nuclear power capacity to produce hydrogen and build high-temperature SMR’s to optimize the use of emissions free nuclear to produce zero emissions hydrogen.

First time in decades that there is an emerging surge in acceptance of nuclear of nuclear energy as necessary to achieve zero carbon emissions goals, with countries like the Netherlands looking to add more capacity after conducting studies showing nuclear is safer and cheaper than variable renewable energy.

First time I can recall one of the leading nuclear fuel consultants UxC reporting to their subscribers that uranium is in a 57M lbs mined supply deficit, that utility and supplier inventories are “declining at a rapid rate” just as global fuel demand growth is accelerating, a clear signal that a bull market is getting underway.

TLDR: with all the catalysts that are in place, I am of the firm believe that uranium related equities, namely the developers and explorers, will offer returns that will outperform any other broad investment asset class/sector in the market. This is a bold claim to make, but I can’t see any other opportunity that offers even close to the same risk vs reward the uranium sector offers.

Do people simply refuse to sell, seeing the beginning of the crash as a simple correction or temporary downtrend? Or, did the crash happen so swiftly that selling was not possible? How does one reconcile taking profits with the potential upside that is missed out on? Anything else that you’d like to share that you think is important?

TheScotchEngineer,0.0,32.0,"KemPharm (KMPH) is a clinical biotech company that develops 'pro-drugs' which are modifications to existing drugs. 

The promising pro-drug candidate that has caused shares to go up +30% today is KP415, an ADHD pro-drug that offers an extended release profile (i.e. take 1 dose per day instead of 3x a day) for methylphenidate which is a first-line treatment for ADHD, particularly for children. The extended release characteristic also has potential to lower the abuse potential for the drug as it has a lower 'drug-liking' rating than methylphenidate alone, and is comparable to a placebo. 

KP415 has successfully completed Phase 3 trials, awaiting PDUFA decision on 2nd Mar. The approval is expected as KP415 is a pro-drug very similar to an existing drug (Vyvanse), and has been proceeding down a fast-track approval pathway due to it being a modifications of an existing approved drug. 

KP415 can be compared to a leading ADHD drug called Vyvanse, which is a pro-drug form of amphetamine, which is the other drug of choice to treat ADHD. 90% of patients respond to either methylphenidate or amphetamine based drugs, and the pro-drug forms have high marketability due to their lower substance abuse potential (think of parents approving medication to children). Vyvanse has ~$3.2bn in sales out of a total $8bn branded ADHD drug market, with the total ADHD market generating sales of ~$15bn. 

KMPH has partnered with a commercial delivery provider with a deal of up to $450m based on net sales for methylphenidate pro-drugs, primarily KP415, but a similar pro-drug KP484 is in the pipeline that would be related. KMPH has another pro-drug of hydrocodone has been approved and has an associated deal of up to $50m, demonstrating their ability to navigate the regulatory and delivery pitfalls. Note that their leadership includes experience from Shire pharmaceuticals (now part of Takeda), that developed Vyvanse, so this is a very known market to them. 

Finally, KMPH recently restructured their debt which was holding them back, and now has cash on hand for several months (at least) of operations. 

Valuation-wise, taking a 10% share of Vyvanse's $3bn sales as a comparson would give potential revenues of $300m market. With an assumed royalty at 5% of net sales we could expect $15m profit annually. With a P/E 10 (pessimistic) this would bring us to a 150m company.

KMPH at $9.20 has a market cap of $107m currently so a $150m cap shows an upside of +40% = $13 share price low end estimate. On the high end, it could easily be double that, given that methylphenidate is currently first-line choice over amphetamine and could displace a significant amount of Vyvanse sales, as well as carve a larger share of the greater ADHD market - there's certainly enough growth room for both pro-drugs given their lower abuse potential. 

Someone else posted some DD on KMPH previously to hold up till PDUFA and sell before, which is certainly a way to play this. I see longer term value in KMPH, given their recent debt restructuring and pro-drug pipeline which also makes them potentially an acquisition target. 

Disclosure: I currently hold a long KMPH position at $9, which I was hoping to enter before the run up today, but likely to hold past the PDUFA.

Edit: updated Vyvanse as a pro-drug of amphetamine, not methamphetamine.",stocks,$KMPH Breaking Out,32.0,0.96

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-16-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq set to add to record highs

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, adding to Friday’s record closes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday for Presidents Day. All three stock benchmarks finished higher last week, in a continuation of February’s strength. For the year, as of Friday’s close, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up nearly 2.8%, 4.8% and 9.4%, respectively.

&gt; * The 30-year Treasury yield held above 2% early Tuesday as investors watched for progress on President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus package on Capitol Hill and the push for wider distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the U.S. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to more than 1.26%.

*****

&gt; # 2. B/itcoin hit a new high over $50,000

&gt; * B/itcoin reached a new record high Tuesday, going over $50,000 per unit for the first time ever, before paring some of those gains. Major firms announced support for digital currencies last week, starting with Tesla revealing it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. Mastercard said Thursday it would support certain c/ryptocurrencies later this year, while BNY Mellon announced the following day it would open up its custody services to digital assets. B/itcoin more than quadrupled in 2020 and it’s up over 60% since the start of this year.

*****

&gt; # 3. Deep freeze in Texas causes massive energy crunch

&gt; * More than 3.8 million households in Texas are in the dark Tuesday morning, as record low temperatures boosted demand for power for heat that pushed the state’s electric grid to its limits. Rolling blackouts, typically seen on 100-degree summer days, were imposed in Texas. The scarcity of power was so great that spot prices of wholesale electricity on the Texas power grid spiked more than 10,000% on Monday. U.S. oil prices also climbed to a pandemic-high above $60 per barrel. The frigid weather was part of a massive winter blast that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains, across parts of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

*****

&gt; # 4. Congress to establish a Capitol riot commission

&gt; * House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that Congress will establish an independent, 9/11-style commission to look into last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Investigations into the riot were already planned, with Senate hearings scheduled later this month in the Rules Committee.

&gt; * House impeachment prosecutors who argued for Donald Trump’s conviction of inciting the attack said Sunday that they proved their case. Democrats also railed against Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, saying they were “trying to have it both ways” in finding the former president not guilty while criticizing him.

*****

&gt; # 5. Biden to make first official domestic trips

&gt; * Trying to move beyond Trump’s acquittal in last week’s impeachment trial, Biden plans to keep up a busy schedule focused on the coronavirus in the coming week. Biden is set to make his first official domestic trips of his presidency, starting with a CNN town hall in Wisconsin on Tuesday to talk to Americans impacted by the pandemic. Biden on Thursday then visits a Pfizer Covid vaccine facility in Michigan as the drugmaker’s two-shot regime and Moderna’s start making more inroads into pharmacies around the nation.

Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be talking about a pretty boring dividend payer: Quest Diagnostics. They've seen a good run-up during COVID and they showed up on a PE screener I ran recently, so I figured I'd check it out.

**Business**

Quest is the world's leading provider of diagnostics and testing. They actually end up serving about the equivalent of one-third of the American adult population every year which I find staggering. They've seen a spike in revenue (see revenues section for more detail) during COVID as they were the first actor in the testing space. Normally, I'd go into more detail by breaking down their various business segments, but Quest only operates in one segment so this section will end up being short.

**Growth Strategy**

[TTM Revenue 12/31/10 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/YYI1qTz)

As you can see, after 9 years of stagnation, Quest finally got a major pickup from COVID. Now, they have to take this opportunity to continue growing. They document some of these strategies in their recent 10K. To cut through the corporate jargon, I'll summarize the 4 points:

1. **Strategic Acquisitions:** Besides providing an opportunity to grow, acquisitions allow Quest to extend its footprint further. Personally, I think an attempt to break into foreign markets could be good if done right, however, this would be very difficult due to varying regulatory standards.
2. **Partnering with Others:** The idea here is simple. By partnering with health plans, IDNs, etc, they can increase market share and become a go-to provider for advanced diagnostics tests. They've been successful in implementing this thus far as evidenced by a 2020 Anthem partnership.
3. **Provide more Tests:** Nothing much to add here, it's pretty self-explanatory. By offering more solutions, they can drive growth through more facets.
4. **Increase usage of their consumer solutions:** Quest saw large growth in their QuestDirect platform. QuestDirect is a consumer-initiated testing platform. This means that you can order tests to do at home or a Quest Patient Center or you can ask questions online.

**Revenues**

[TTM Revenue 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/OU9lCd0)

Quest has grown revenue 22.12% YoY, 27.57% over the last 3 years, and 26.03% over the last 5. Just by looking at the chart, you can tell that a large portion of growth came from the pandemic, but quantifying that makes that fact even more apparent.

Moving to Net Income, you're met with the same story on a more drastic scale. YoY, Quest has increased net income by 66.28%. Quest has grown net income by 85.71% over the last 3 years and 101.41% in the last 5 years.

**Margins**

Quest currently has a net margin of 15.16%. This is encouraging compared to their historical margins. 3 years ago, their margin was 10.43% and 9.42% in 2015. Comparing that with its competitors, Labcorp has a net margin. of 11.13%, Buffett favorite Davita has a net margin of 6.70%, and Abbott had a net margin of 12.99%.

**Assets/Liabilities**

[Total Assets 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/OsVbxNQ)

[Total Liabilities 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/CHGjnJB)

As you can see, both Total Liabilities and Total Assets have increased about the same amount over the last 5 years. The only difference here is that they have significantly more assets than debt. They have a current Debt/Equity ratio of 0.59x and interest payments are well covered. To look a little deeper, subtracting long-term debt of 4.01B from total liabilities of 7.22B and we see that Quest has 3.21B in short-term liabilities. Quest only has 1.16B in Cash on Hand which means that there's 2.05B in short-term liabilities that aren't covered by cash. While this isn't amazing, it's expected and I would be very surprised if this wasn't the case.

**Free Cash Flow**

Quest has grown Free Cash Flow by 71.94% over the last 3 years and 184.41% over the last 5. This is promising as it implies they'll be able to continue dividend growth. Speaking of dividends....

**Dividends**

Quest currently pays a 1.92% annual dividend ($2.24 quarterly) which is well above the average health care dividend yield of 1.54%. On top of that, it's a consistent dividend. Quest has a 22.64% payout ratio and had grown its dividend for 9 years prior to COVID. They lowered their dividend 1-cent to $2.21 focus their capital on testing, however, they are back to growing with the next yield being $2.24, 2 cents above their previous highest yield in 2019.

Quest's next ex-dividend yield is April 6th.

**Price Ratios/Other**

This section aims to go over all of the relevant ratios and percentages that didn't fit anywhere else. I'll show the ratios on the chart below, and then I'll break them down.

&amp;#x200B;

|Ratio|Quest|Labcorp|DaVita|Abbott|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|11.20x|9.82x|14.32x|31.78x|&lt;15|
|P/B Ratio|2.29x|2.44x|7.25x|6.23x|&lt;2x|
|P/S Ratio|1.69x|1.67x|1.14x|6.05x|&lt;2x|
|P/FCF Ratio|10.05x|15.36x|9.55x|45.58x|&lt;15x|
|ROE|23.04%|19.47%|39.81%|19.37%|\&gt;20%|
|PM/RG Ratio (My personal creation)|0.58x|1.99x|30.73x|4.30x|&lt;2.5x|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for this sector may be under 15x. The problem is this number cannot be universally applied. While Abbott does supply testing solutions, they are also a supplier of drugs that has grown revenue significantly faster than others and have seen more consistent growth since their spin-off of Abbvie than many others in the testing space, including Quest.

That being said, Quest has the second-lowest PE in the testing space and looks pretty attractive from this angle.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 2. Other than Abbott, many testing providers have exhibited choppy growth and a temporary boost as a result of COVID, so I'd like to see them trading pretty low compared to book value. Interestingly, none of the major testing providers were below 2x. This could mean 1 of 2 things.

1. Many companies in the testing sector are overvalued compared to book value.
2. My P/B number was unreasonable and arbitrary.

I'm inclined to believe the latter, but I'd be interested to see what you guys think.

**P/S Ratio**

I said a good P/S Ratio was 2x (same as my P/B threshold), and this time, some companies actually qualified. In fact, most of them did with DaVita trading at a low 1.14x P/S Ratio, Labcorp coming in with a 1.67x P/S Ratio, and Quest coming in closet third at a good 1.69x. Overall, P/S Ratios look good all-around.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I'm pretty new to using this ratio, but I identified under 15x to be a good multiple. When I Google what a good p/fcf ratio is, the consensus is 20x, but since many of these companies have stagnating revenues, so I decided to hold them to a higher standard. The only two qualifiers here are DaVita and Quest with DaVita coming in at an impressive 9.55x and Quest coming in at a cool 10.05x. So far, these numbers are looking good for Quest.

**ROE**

I was looking for an ROE higher than 20% here, and we again saw Quest and DaVita being the only qualifiers with Quest coming in at 23.04% and DaVita producing an impressive 39.81% ROE. If you're going to have potentially stagnating revenues, you should really be good at efficiently generating capital, and that's what Quest is.

To break down Quest's ROE further, let's look at their historical ROEs:

|Quest Ratio|2010|2015|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ROE|18.51%|15.73%|16.10%|14.05%|15.47%|23.04%|

Looking at this chart, we're told a different story. Quest historically never broke 20%, it was only because of COVID that they recently broke through. That means that next year (2022), we could see a return to 15-16% ROEs. Let's compare this trend with DaVita's historical numbers:

|DaVita Ratio|2010|2015|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ROE|17.82%|5.17%|12.98%|3.70%|24.65%|39.63%|

While it looks like DaVita had an ROE of above 20% before COVID, this drastic 2019 move can be attributed to UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of DaVita, not an improvement in the underlying business.

The takeaway here is that these high ROEs are likely temporary, and they will go back to historical levels once COVID is no longer a threat.

**PM/RG**

This is a ratio I thought of myself this last week and I'm excited to see what you guys think of it. I wanted to find a ratio that could measure how rational price movements were, however, I couldn't find one. I ended up creating a pretty simple ratio to measure it. While I may change it up in the future, I think it works for now.

The Ratio works by dividing the price percentage movement over some period by the revenue percentage movement over the same period. So, for example, if ABC's price went up by 50% over the last year and their revenues only went up by 25%, they'd have a PM/RG of 2x.

I decided to measure price and revenue movements from 1/1/2020 -&gt; now. I put an ideal PM/RG ratio down as being &lt;2.5x. Normally, I'd want to see it be under 2x, however, since testing stocks have been a big beneficiary of COVID, I decided to give a little more leeway. The only two companies that qualified here were Labcorp and Quest. Labcorp had a PM/RG of 1.99x and Quest 0.58x.

I'm very surprised with Quest's PM/RG. They only appreciated 58% compared to revenue. To me, this could be a *potential* indicator that Quest has been undervalued by the market.

**DCF Valuation**

Assuming a -1% 5yr Revenue CAGR, an 8% Discount Rate, a 22.4% EBITDA Margin, and a Terminal Revenue Multiplier of 3.8x, Quest's fair value is $188.48 (a 59.8% upside from the current price of $117.96). Let's go over some other scenarios to give ourselves a range.

**Bullish Valuation**

I think I find it highly unlikely Quest will be able to capitalize on the recent increase in revenues to continue growing, but that'll be what I'm assuming in this scenario.

With a 1.5% Revenue CAGR, an 7% Discount Rate, a 22.4% EBITDA Margin, and a Terminal Revenue Multiplier of 3.8x, Quest has an implied Fair Value of $225.89 (91.5% upside from the current price of $117.96).

Again, this scenario is **VERY** improbable, but I figured I'd include it just for an idea of the theoretical max FV.

**Bearish Valuation**

I'd peg this as unlikely, but plausible.

Assuming a 5yr Revenue CAGR of -2.5%, a 9% discount rate, a 20% EBITDA Margin, and a 3.5x Terminal Revenue Multiplier, Quest has a Fair Value of $151.86 (28.7% Upside from the current price of $117.96).

**PE Valuation**

I use the PE Valuation as a way to sanity check my DCF Fair Value. Using an average 1 year PE of 14.51x and a current TTM EPS of $10.47, we get a Fair Value of $167.83 (43.10% Upside from the current price of $117.96). As we can see, the PE Valuation is pretty in line with the DCF Valuation we came up with above.

**Risks**

1. **Regulation:** A large part of the Biden Administration's agenda was based on making healthcare more affordable. While it could be all talk, the Democrats having majority control of the Senate and the House make any regulation Biden proposes is fairly likely to be passed. This could drive down profitability throughout the Healthcare sector.
2. **Competition:** This is going to be a risk no matter what sector you're in. There are a lot of large testing providers, so there's always a chance margins are driven down by a competitor's more effective and cheaper test.
3. **Failure to produce new tests:** The title is pretty self-explanatory. If Quest stops being able to license and create new tests, their revenue growth will slow/stop. The FDA being overwhelmed by COVID treatment/vaccine cases could make this risk a reality.
4. **Failure to defend IP:** If Quest fails to protect their Intellectual Property and they lose the rights to exclusively market their tests, competition will be driving down margins more aggressively than before.

**Conclusion**

I'm bullish on Quest. They're significantly undervalued and even with declining revenues being assumed over the next 5 years, they're still trading &gt;35% below Fair Value. Compared to competitors, they've appreciated very little and their safe dividend makes this a good long-term hold. I plan on initiating a position on Monday and have a timeline of 1-3 years.",stocks,Quest Diagnostics ($DGX) DD - An Undervalued Dividend Payer,29.0,0.89
BuffettsBrokeBro,0.0,30.0,"No one likes to see red in their portfolio. And no one wants to hear about other investors getting wrecked, however vindicated perma-bears may feel when we get into market correction territory. There are a lot of new investors who recently got into investors because they saw the upside potential, and which weren’t expecting to see (relatively) big losses. This post is for them.

While I have my “safe” index funds as half my portfolio, together with “satellite” more industry-focused ETFs (genomics, and a more prospective small gap and global markets), I’m in fairly deep to tech and the NASDAQ. Like a lot of you, the last few weeks have put me safely in the red.

It’s worth considering what you’re investing FOR at this point. If, like me, you’re relatively young and looking to grow wealth - it’s why tech is appealing. It’s why potential future growth in smaller and riskier tech stocks is a large part of the portfolio. Ultimately, that upside can be very worth it - you can make exponential gains on relatively small amounts. But with greater upside comes greater risk. The downside. Which we’re now starting to experience in potential tech market correction territory.

See this as the necessary pain, and the opportunity to get into positions at a discount, and average down on those long term investments you believe in. Continue to consider your investment thesis and DD. If you believe in the stocks long term, these red days don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. Don’t panic sell just because it isn’t green.

That said, also use this as a learning opportunity. Make sure you’re *actually* doing DD. That means quantitative, as well as qualitative. As much as posters discussing P/S and P/E ratios have been dismissed as “boomers”, market fundamentals remain important, however divorced prices seem to become from them. It’s hard to price exponential growth and the chance to dominate industries that barely exist now, but understanding and applying the fundamentals will help you decide which companies to get into in different industry sectors, and a good price to do so at. This will help your confidence in holding, and setting targets on when to enter new positions.

Also, don’t make the classic gambler’s mistake of betting what you can’t afford to lose on “a sure thing”. There’s no such thing in the market.

Ultimately, there may have been a renewable energy / EV bubble that may now have burst. There will likely be bag holders. All these stocks could continue to bleed. But, you’ve missed the window to get out with relatively small losses. Rather than panic selling, continue to take a rational view on what the companies you’re in are fundamentally worth - and therefore whether you’re happy to baghold for an amount of time to see profits on them, or if cutting your losses makes sense.

It’s also worth dispelling the idea that “tech” exists as some homogenous thing, or that these companies are all like the dot com bubble - essentially worthless, with no business models, just trying to capitalise on the internet’s future potential. Plenty of these companies may be overvalued and significantly oversold, but they aren’t worthless. “Tech” sits across so many industry verticals it becomes slightly meaningless as a term. Cloud computing, semiconductors, social media, future technologies such as indoor farming / genomics / space transportation, eCommerce, consumer hardware, data analytics etc may all be “tech”, but you can hopefully see they aren’t all one and the same.

The time to *really* worry about prospective growth small / med cap stocks carrying a lot of debt as they build towards businesses that may be profitable in future is when debt becomes more expensive. While the markets are never rational, there hasn’t been a fundamental change meaning cheap debt is no longer a thing. Fear and panic creates more fear and panic. Keep hold of your head. Take time away from your portfolio. Don’t speculate with what you can’t afford to lose. Have confidence you’ll weather this, make sound investments and see future gains when consistent green days are back on the menu.

TL;DR - high growth potential tech is risky, because of the potential massive upside. With that comes downside. You won’t get such a wild ride with “safe” NYSE type stocks for the most part, but you’re also unlikely to get such high returns. Consider what’s important to you. Do proper DD, so you’re clear on why you’re investing and the value (not price) of a stock. Don’t put in what you can’t afford to lose, or leave in long enough to weather the storm.",stocks,This downside is all part of investing for exponential growth,30.0,0.92

The reason I’m clear on this is because for the time being, and specifically this post stick to books that aren’t exclusively loooooong term.

I really enjoy technical analysis, that being said I feel so so uninformed in terms of how wide the scope of technical analysis is. A book specifically tailored for that would be fantastic.

Technical analysis is not the only thing though. I don’t plan on trading exclusively with TA so of course a book covering broader scopes is necessary.

I’d like the book to be graphical. I won’t lie, I haven’t read a single book on trading. Idk if it is common for the books to have colored graphs and examples or not. I would really prefer that, as im a visual learner. 

I’d like there to be depth, limiting my need for youtube. Less youtube could be equal to less room to find a bad video and the following misinformation.

The S&amp;P 500 reversed a 1.8% decline to close up slightly, breaking a five-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped about a drop of 360 points, or more than 1%, to close modestly higher for the third straight session.

&gt; * Tuesday’s turnaround, especially in tech stocks, came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation is still “soft” and the economic outlook is still “highly uncertain” due to the pandemic. That eased fears of a central bank policy change. Powell appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday in the second and final part of his mandated semiannual economic testimony to Congress.

&gt; * The Food and Drug Administration’s staff endorsed Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, a critical step in bringing a third shot to the U.S. marketplace. The staff report is meant to brief the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which will meet Friday to review J&amp;J’s request for emergency use authorization.

&gt; # 2. Tesla bounces and a fund manager with a hot-hand may be the reason

&gt; * Tesla rose more than 4% in premarket trading after staging a major comeback Tuesday. At one point, as b/itcoin prices sank, shares plunged 13%. By the close, it recouped most of those losses to finish down only nearly 2.2%. However, Tesla’s four-session slide did total more than 11%, dragging the high-flying stock into the red by nearly 1% for 2021. Over the past 12 months, it was still up a whopping 287%.

&gt; * Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, who’s had a hot hand recently, scooped up more than $120 million worth of Tesla shares during Tuesday’s rout and subsequent comeback. Wood’s buying may have helped spark the Tuesday turnaround in Tesla. CNBC’s Jim Cramer tweeted that “Cathie puts the bottom in Tesla!”

&gt; * Wood told Bloomberg Radio on Tuesday she’s particularly bullish on Tesla’s ride-hailing service as a bridge to autonomous driving. “We do not think many analysts are giving Tesla credit for autonomous. If they were, the stock would be a lot higher,” he added.

*****

&gt; # 3. B/itcoin rebounds, surging back above $50,000

&gt; * Wood, also a b/itcoin bull, told Bloomberg, ”“We’re very positive on B/itcoin, very happy to see a healthy correction here, no market is straight up.” B/itcoin climbed back above the $50,000 on Wednesday, after a brutal sell-off earlier this week. B/itcoin is up more than 70% year-to-date and over 400% in the last 12 months.

&gt; * Square said Tuesday it bought $170 million worth b/itcoin. The fintech firm, run by Jack Dorsey who’s also CEO of Twitter, bought $50 million worth of the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency last year. Dorsey, one of b/itcoin’s most well-known proponents, once predicted it would eventually become the “single currency” of the internet.

&gt; # 4. GameStop CFO to step down after Reddit-driven stock rally

&gt; * GameStop CFO Jim Bell will step down next month. The video game retailer said Bell’s resignation was not due to any disagreement with the company relating to its operations, including accounting principles and practices. However, a source told Reuters that Bell’s exit was unrelated to the recent Reddit-fueled wild swings in GameStop’s stock. However, the source said his departure was initiated by GameStop, in a sign he was not viewed as the right fit as the retailer transitions into a tech-oriented business.

&gt; # 5. Lowe’s tops earnings estimates as same-store sales jump

&gt; * Lowe’s shares rose 2% in premarket trading after the home improvement retialer said Wednesday its fourth-quarter same-store sales climbed 28% as consumers spent more on home projects during Covid. Adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share on revenue of $20.31 billion both beat expectations. Lowe’s reiterated the forecast it gave at an investor day in December. Chief Financial Officer David Denton had said home improvement sales will likely decline in 2021 as more people get Covid-19 vaccines and spend more time outside their homes.

You can easily make 20-30% selling these options, and if there is a crash you can simply just take assignment, and be better off that if you had bought shares.

Along with others, I had bought some shares (foolishly) of AMC (200 @ $11).  As I examine what I want to do with the shares now, I started thinking more in depth about what the AMC's future financial prospects are (yes, should have done this up front...).

So I started questioning can AMC get back to 2017 or 2018 levels of stock prices ($14 to $20) or higher?  I am hoping the r/stocks crowd can provide some second opinions (or corrections) to my analysis here.


**Historical Prices**

Looking at AMC's price history in the past 5 years, it was a decline starting 2019 after their first quarter report where it started it's decline and ending the calendar year at around $7 where it started the year at $13.

Considering COVID as extraordinary circumstance, I excluded 2020 as I looked to this.  Pretend that if COVID did not happen what would it have done.

There are others on here where I saw comments that they have been in decline leading up to COVID (2020), so I wanted to see why.  Also I wanted to validate that statement that they were on the downward trend.


**2019 - a special year**

2019 was a special year for AMC's stock prices where it saw it's share price tumble after the first quarter.  Looking at the financials, it is easy to see why.  Looking at their annual balance sheet, you see that their Net Income from 2018 level of $110M went to 2019 level -$149M.  This is a big swing.&amp;nbsp;

Their revenues stayed fairly close between the two years (if any, 2019 went up). So why the drop in Net Income?

*So did AMC end up costing more to operate its business by that much year on year?*

Their Rental and Landing Fees went up by $200M.  
Their Gain on Sale of Security went down by around $90M and their Special Income Charges went down $80M.

*That is a big jump.  What happened in 2019?*

One of the major changes is on how leases are represented in the balance sheet (from my limited understanding of accounting) called ASC 842 where operating leases (which probably represents a big chunk of AMC's balance sheet) will be shown as debt on the balance sheet.  In my limited understanding this means the change in net income if all things are given equal (revenue, actual operating expense etc), net income will be less and importantly EPS as well.  ASC 842 came into effect at beginning of 2019 and the first time it would have shown on the balance sheet would have been first quarter report of 2019 where the share started its steep downward trend on that year.


**So was AMC then making money?**
For this we look at EBITDA or their cash flow.  
Fourth Quarter/Full Year Financial Report from AMC site: Adjusted EBITDA of $269.1M up 11.6% after adjusting 2018 for ASC 842 impact.
So their earning actually went up year on year if we were to compare earnings apples to apples.

Free cash flow (2018 adjusted for ASC 842): 2019 - $303.1M.  2018 - $117.4

That is quite the increase year on year on earnings if reporting methodology was kept consistent.  However, spreadsheet technicality doesn't really give us the whole picture.


**Market growth**

2019 also saw an increase in international markets where it somewhat made up for the decrease in US markets.  However, overall decrease in attendance overall.  Looking at their cash flow statement (which is more a true comparison), their Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $140M year over year, but their Net Cash used decreased overall hence increasing their cash flow.  While maintaining similar level of screens.  This may mean that their margins were getting better pre-Covid.

If they were to continue the trajectory of international growth (perhaps expansion) and with better margin, they could have done well.


**Comparison with Cinemark**

Picking a cinema operator that lists in North America comparing with Cinemark to see if AMC is better/worse at end of 2019.


Company|2019 No. Of Screens|2019 Theatres|2019 Adjusted EBITDA|Curr Enterprise Value|Curr Market Cap
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Cinemark|6,132|554|$178M|$5.5B|$2.43B
AMC|11,041|1,004|$269M|$11.72B|$1.9B

You could argue that EBITDA (or earnings) should be proportional to number of screens for a theatre company (and it does seem that EBITDA to screen ratio is similar between the two).  So more screens would mean more earnings as long as the screens are operational.

We however see AMC has twice the EV of Cinemark (with less market cap).  EV being market cap + debt - cash, this would indicate that AMC has a lot more debt.

**Outlook**  

Then the question comes down to has 2020 caused irreparable damage to the business that even if things go back to ""normal"" that they cannot reach the level of earnings?

Currently AMC has Impairment of Capital Asset of $2B in 2020 (compare that to $84M).  This is most likely due to the deprecation of the value of their assets (I mean how much are theatres worth as an asset these days).  If things open back up, the value of said assets should increase hence lessening their expense. Along with it revenue will rise as they open up.

However, to weather the storm, AMC had to take on debt and in turn sale of securities which shows as another hit on their expenses this year.  They will need to make ground on this once things are normal.

Overall, AMC looks like a gamble on if/when things will return to normal.  It would be interesting to see how their partial openings of theatres affect their overall cash flow situation.  Their next earnings call most likely would not contain a lot of good news I would imagine, so at least a quarter after where there is enough data on partial opening (along side what movies are offered) would give a better sense of where it is all headed.

For the next earnings call if there is any data on revenue for partially opened theatre I would look to their attendance to number of screens compared to revenue generated.  Then see if the trend from 2019 onwards has any positive trajectory going towards 2019 levels.  Then once they are fully opened, you can have better confidence their revenue/cash flow to recover.  However, this needs to be balanced with what kind of debt they have and whether that can be reduced.

My current thought is to hold at least until their earnings call to see where this is all heading and re-evaluate my position.  There are other opportunities to throw my money away.

I am also going to look at their 2020 financials more in depth to see if there are any useful nuggets that I can understand better what their plan post-Covid may look like.

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

&gt; * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

&gt; # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

&gt; * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

&gt; # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

&gt; * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

&gt; # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

&gt; * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson &amp; Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

I'm also building a portfolio for my son, not a college savings or anything but I want to make sure that if he decides that he wants to go to college, he has the money. And if not, I want to make sure that he's financially ok whenever he leaves home (he's 3yrs old at the moment.)  So his portfolio will hopefully look good by then.

How Alibaba Makes Money


Alibaba's core e-commerce segment generates the largest share of total revenue


By Matthew JohnstonUpdated Feb 4, 2021


Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) is a holding company legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands but which conducts its e-commerce businesses through its Chinese subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs). Its primary business is to offer a digital marketplace where consumers and merchants can connect and buy and sell from each other. Alibaba operates its business through four primary segments, led by its giant e-commerce operations.


Chief among its competitors are other established Chinese e-commerce and Internet companies, such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., as well as global and regional e-commerce companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). Since Alibaba also operates in the cloud-computing business and digital-media and digital-entertainment businesses, it competes with companies specializing in those markets as well.


Key Takeaways


Alibaba provides digital marketplaces for merchants and consumers.
Alibaba's largest business is its core e-commerce operations, but cloud computing is growing the fastest.
Alibaba aims to be a leader in the development of the infrastructure of commerce.
China's antitrust watchdog launched an investigation into Alibaba in late December 2020.


Alibaba's Financials


Alibaba files financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and does so in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company follows a reporting schedule where the end of its fiscal year (FY) occurs at the end of March.


Alibaba also reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, and depreciation (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITA, which refers to earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization.


Although Alibaba's reporting currency is the Renminbi, the company provides conversions into U.S. dollars, which are used in this story.


The company's revenue rose 36.9% to $33.9 billion in Q3 FY 2021, which ended December 31, 2020.


It was slightly above the 35.3% annual rate of growth posted for all of FY 2020, which ended March 31, 2020.


Alibaba's net income rose 55.5% to $12.0 billion in Q3 FY 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company noted that the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in the net gain from increases in the market prices of its equity investments in publicly-traded companies.


Alibaba’s Business Segments

Alibaba monetizes its services through four main business segments that it formally names as: core commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, and innovation initiatives and others. The company provides segment break downs of revenue and adjusted EBITA, the latter of which was reported as $9.4 billion for the company for Q3 FY 2021.


Core Commerce


Alibaba's core commerce segment is comprised of its various digital retail and wholesale marketplaces, as well as logistics and local consumer services. The company generates revenue from merchants through the sale of a variety of marketing services, membership fees, customer management services, product sales, commissions on transactions, and software service fees. The company generates revenue from local consumers through platform commissions and on-demand delivery service fees.

Core commerce is Alibaba's largest source of revenue at $30.0 billion, or about 88% of the company's total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment grew 38.2% compared to the same three-month period a year ago.

In terms of income measures, the core commerce segment represents nearly 100% of the company's adjusted EBITA, which grew 14.7% to $10.2 billion in Q3 FY 2021.12﻿﻿ Losses in two of Alibaba's other business segments partly account for the higher-reported figure in the core commerce segment than in adjusted EBITA for the company as a whole.


Cloud Computing


Alibaba Cloud provides enterprise customers with a complete suite of cloud services, including database, storage, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine-learning platform, and other services.


The company's cloud computing segment generates revenue from enterprise customers based on the duration and specific usage of the services.


Cloud computing is Alibaba's second largest source of revenue at $2.5 billion, or about 7% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. The segment is also the company's fastest-growing source of revenue. Revenue grew 50.3% compared to the year-ago quarter.

Alibaba reported adjusted EBITA of $3 million for its cloud computing segment in Q3 FY 2021, compared to a loss in adjusted EBITA in the year-ago quarter.﻿﻿ It was the first time the segment achieved positive adjusted EBITA.15﻿﻿ The cloud computing segment makes up just a tiny fraction of overall adjusted EBITA.


Digital Media and Entertainment

Alibaba's digital media and entertainment segment exists as part of the company's strategy to capture revenue from consumption beyond its core commerce businesses.The segment generates revenue primarily from customer management services and membership subscription fees.

Digital media and entertainment is Alibaba's third largest source of revenue at $1.2 billion, or about 4% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment grew 0.6% compared to the same quarter a year ago.Alibaba reported a $213 million loss in adjusted EBITA in Q3 FY 2021.12﻿


Innovation Initiatives and Others


Alibaba's innovation initiatives and others segment aims to innovate and develop new services and products that can meet the needs of its customers. Past innovations include digital-navigation app Amap and network-communication app DingTalk.The segment generates revenue primarily through services fees and product sales to enterprise customers and consumers.

Innovation initiatives and others comprise the smallest share of Alibaba's revenue at $207 million, or less than 1% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment rose 9.5% compared to the same three-month period a year ago.
Alibaba posted a $305 million loss in adjusted EBITA in Q3 FY 2021.


Alibaba's Recent Developments


Alibaba announced in late September 2019 its goal of reaching 1 billion annual active consumers in its China consumer business by the end of its 2024 FY, as part of its latest five-year plan.
As of December 31, 2020, the company was still short of its goal by 221 million annual active consumers.

﻿In late December 2020, China's market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that it had launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba. The antitrust watchdog noted that it was acting in response to reports that Alibaba was pressuring merchants that sell wares on its platforms not to sell on the platforms of its competitors.

On February 3, 2021, Chinese regulators came to an agreement on a restructuring plan that would turn Alibaba's financial technology affiliate Ant Group Co. into a financial holding company. That change would make the fintech firm subject to similar capital requirements faced by banks.

﻿﻿ The move comes after an attempted initial public offering (IPO) of Ant was halted by regulators in early November 2020, which was followed in late December 2020 by regulators issuing a statement that they would meet with Ant Group about implementing regulations and other rules.1",stocks,$BABA - Is the juice worth the squeeze ?,26.0,0.8

I'm sure most of you are tired of CNBC's antics. Noticed some pretty disturbing behavior from Forbes lately worth flagging.

A few days ago, Forbes' official Twitter account ""randomly"" re-tweeted an article on AMC dating back to May 2020. In May last year, there was still red-hot speculation on an AMC/Amazon acquisition. That article is below:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2020/05/22/amazon-goes-to-themovies/?sh=2f44ebcf7bdc](https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2020/05/22/amazon-goes-to-themovies/?sh=2f44ebcf7bdc)

Last night, they translated this same article into French, and then updated the date to Feb 2021. They then took the original innocuous title, and then changed it to ""Amazon on the verge of acquiring AMC, the world's largest movie chain"". You had to get to the middle of the article before there was a note that said this was all pure speculation and simply a translation of a May 2020 article.

[https://www.forbes.fr/business/amazon-sur-le-point-dacquerir-amc-la-plus-grande-chaine-de-salles-de-cinema-au-monde/](https://www.forbes.fr/business/amazon-sur-le-point-dacquerir-amc-la-plus-grande-chaine-de-salles-de-cinema-au-monde/)

This article was widely circulated, and lead AMC to being up almost 15% pre-market today. After the morning pump, they deleted the article, but I've saved a screenshot of the headline here: [https://i.imgur.com/HSxow6B.png](https://i.imgur.com/HSxow6B.png). If anybody has the original in full, please PM me, and let me know if my French translation is correct (edit: I found it on Wayback Machine, which validates everything above. PM me for a link or check my comments)

I do not know what forces are at work here. One theory - Forbes is owned by Integrated Whale Media Investments, a China-based firm. As you may know, AMC is also currently controlled by a China-based firm Wanda Group, which recently filed with the SEC to convert their shares to facilitate a sale. With such a large stake, they won't be able to sell at once and will need to sell it blocks over a period of weeks. Whatever it is, there's something dark at play.

I am a 21yr old looking to do my best to set myself up for financial success in the future. At this point in my life I have a decent amount of disposable income that I’ve been saving. I am just now diving into stock trading as my experience up to this point has been limited to low risk investments. Here’s some info about my current financial situation:

- Making ~39k pretax from day job
- Roth401k 9%+5% employer match contribution
- Vanguard brokerage: ~$12k between VG Total Market Index, VG 500 Index and VG International Growth Fund...all automatically invested into each week
- $1k in bank savings account as emergency fund
- Excellent credit score, been building credit score for 2.5yrs, pay off every card in full each month 
- Only real expense/debt is car 


The whole meme stock hype cost me. I FOMOed into $GME with $4k and bag held. I got out of half my positions just under my avg cost but decided to hold onto the rest (stupidly) and have been watching the price drop since. All of the GME hype got me delved into the world of stocks. For over 2 weeks I’ve been doing research on the stock market and how day trading/swing trading works, how to read a chart, what indicators mean what, etc. 

I’ve set up a new brokerage account with WeBull for the purpose of trading stocks. After my research, I’ve come to the conclusion that since I’m still very young I should have $$ invested in some long term industry leaders such as Amazon, Google, Apple, etc. 3 years ago just after I started my job Amazon was trading for just under $1k. Had I invested my money into a share of Amazon instead of the vanguard funds I had them going into, I would be up 300%!! 

I feel very stupid for keeping my money in such low risk investments at my age and current position in life, but now I am looking to capitalize on this opportunity. What would you guys recommend as a proper portfolio allocation for someone in my situation? What % of my money should be going to lower risk ETFs/Mutuals vs what % should be in solid performing long term stocks? I am considering liquidating one of my vanguard funds and purchasing a share of Amazon when the price dips in the near future, but I think turning off auto investments and saving up is a better move because of taxes. 

I also plan on depositing $100-$200 for day trading, just to “test the waters” and see if I can apply anything that I’ve learned over these past weeks to make some profitable trades.

The acquisition talks are not currently active, the FT reported, adding that in the past Pinterest has signaled its preference to remain an independent company. The FT reported that Microsoft’s acquisition strategy is targeting active online communities that it can pair with its cloud platform.

Pinterest PINS, +2.15% has a current market valuation of about $50 billion, bolstered by a 36% rise in its shares over the past three months.

**Highlights**:  
- 94% Quarter Growth YoY for Q3 2020.  
- 82% Yearly Growth (FY19 = $101.7M, FY20 guidance = $185M).  
- This company is profitable. Guidance for 2020 is $5.5M EBITDA.  
- They have 100+ Commercial &amp; Enterprise customers, including Microsoft, British Telecom, NASA, Homeland Security.   
- Signed a $500M potential 5-year revenue contract with Homeland Security in November 2020.  
- Just today they were awarded a new contract with the Department of Health and Human Services ""WidePoint is one of only two U.S. Government ECA providers authorized by the U.S. Department of Defense.""  
- 7.79% shares held by insiders, 15.54% held by institutions.  
- By Q4 2021 they are planning to “successfully integrate strategic acquisitions”.  
- In 2017 new management team appointed. The entire board has been appointed their role within the last 3 years. This is what has started the 33% CAGR since 2017.  
- Only $6.68M debt.  
- Only 7.63M shares float.  
- Full earnings expected in March, 2021.  


**Value/Competitors**:  
- Widepoint have a diverse offering so they do not have any direct competitors. From their 10-K report you can see their TM2 solution competes with multiple companies in different market segments, additionally most are private companies.  
- Their P/S ratio is a mere 0.62. This is insanely low for a Tech company with a scalable solution, is profitable AND reporting high levels of growth. I can see this being a multi-bagger.

**Stock: Vuzix Corp ($VUZI)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: +46.3%

Month on Month increase in mentions: +1029% 

Average sentiment across mentions: **+34.97%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

Vuzix is an American technology firm that mainly focuses on wearable display technology, virtual and augmented reality. One of the major differences between Vuzix and its competitors is that Vuzix focuses on specific niche sectors like healthcare, logistics, service training, etc. and their products are currently being used in the market today. Vuzix is considered a pioneer in wearable computing and augmented reality and has been working in this field since 1997. 

The advancements made in mobile technology and 5G networks have now reached a stage where it enables wearable technology that is not clunky or too intrusive like the Google glasses. Currently, they have 3 products (M400, M4000, and Blade), all of which are targeted towards industrial customers and are currently deployed in the field. 

**Financials**

Vuzix is not a profitable company and expects to report an operating loss of around $4.4MM for Q4 2020. Their revenue experienced almost a 100% spike from $2MM in Q4’19 to 4MM in Q4’20. Even though the company is not profitable yet, they maintain a great balance sheet. 

Debt to Equity ratio is only 0.09 and they have a strong cash position of $52MM (inclusive of converted warrants) which implies they have a long runway to scale and make the unit economics work. They are also currently foraying into a total solutions package that is part hardware and part SaaS to create a recurring revenue model.

One additional thing to consider here is that there has been consistent insider buying of shares and no selling which indirectly showcases the management’s confidence in the company’s future prospects.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

The buzz is generated primarily due to the following reasons 

Cathie Wood’s ARK bought more than 1MM shares of Vuzix in their Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF(ARKQ). According to ARK’s forecast, AR market would grow from $1B today to $130B by 2030 and Vuzix is the leading contender with its long experience and wide IP rights (Vuzix currently has 184 Patents in the AR/VR field). 

One of the other factors which is driving up the demand is pandemic-driven adoption trends. There are strong demands from the field of virtual healthcare and remote training and service calls. Most of their products are back-ordered/out of stock due to the extreme demand.

They have also fared well at CES 2021 winning 3 awards for their Next Generation Smart Glasses (A smart glass that looks exactly like normal specs). This news should definitely be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism as CES is liberal in giving out awards and Vuzix hasn’t given out their glasses for testing to any reliable tech reviewers.

**Risk and Competition** 

There is definitely significant risk associated with investing in small-cap stocks. The main risk factors for Vuzix that I could see are 

a. Competition from Big-Tech firms: Almost all the major tech players (Apple, Google, Qualcomm) are in the field/planning to enter the field of AR glasses. While Vuzix owns a considerable number of patents, the best-case scenario for them would be to get acquired by a big tech company as they don’t have the financial backing or supply chain capabilities to take on established companies and successfully deliver on a consumer product.

   b. Unit economics: Vuzix cannot be classified as a startup (they have been around for 23 years) and is still cash flow negative. The company needs to improve its scalability so to generate profits. The current rise in demand due to pandemic might be just the ideal situation for them to scale. 

c.  Intel ownership change: 30% of the company was owned by Intel in 2015. As of Mar’21, Intel does not have any ownership in the company. I am not able to find any reliable source of information on why Intel sold their stake in the company. But, on the other hand, there are established funds like BlackRock and ARK buying into the company. 

**Conclusion** 

Augmented Reality is being touted as one of the megatrends of the next decade. Even though there are significant risks in-terms of widespread acceptance of AR among consumers, established and well-funded competitors, Vuzix with its wide portfolio of products, proven market use case in niche sectors and extensive IP rights puts it in a very strong position for the future.

I am not saying this will be the next $GME, I am not a financial advisor, and the following is only my amateur opinion.  I just like the stock.

$RKT is the second most shorted stock right now and while it’s coming back to earth today, it had an amazing run yesterday (+78%) and is still up 15% from Monday’s close. The #1 shorted stock (55% of float) is $KMPH which had an 80% gain premarket and is currently sitting at 50%. I did not get in on either of those stocks, and they have moved up too much recently for me to mess with them. Which brings us to the #3 shorted stock (34% of float), $OTRK. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What is $OTRK?**

$OTRK, Ontrak, Inc., operates as an artificial intelligence powered, virtualized outpatient healthcare treatment company that provides in-person or telehealth intervention services to health plans and other third-party payors.  Its Ontrak PRE (Predict-Recommend-Engage) platform predicts people whose chronic disease will improve with behavior change, recommends care pathways that people are willing to follow, and engages people who aren't getting the care they need.  The company's technology-enabled OnTrak program is designed to treat health plan members with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that cause or exacerbate chronic medical diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, COPD, and congestive heart failure.  The OnTrak integrates evidence-based psychosocial and medical interventions delivered in-person or via telehealth along with care coaching and in-market community care coordinators who address the social and environmental determinants of health. Ontrak is known for its proprietary methodology in understanding and engaging members who need treatment, as well as for quickly translating proven science into practice. The company was formerly known as Catasys, Inc. and changed its name to Ontrak, Inc. in July 2020.  The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California.

Telemedicine is obviously huge right now, and it’s great that they have an in-person option as well. The pandemic has also increased the need for mental health and substance abuse treatment and their AI system should help keep costs down and improve over time. And I love their mission of stopping diseases before they start, therefore reducing one’s lifetime medical costs. Unfortunately this mission is in contradiction with some health care providers’ goal of maximizing short term profits (more on this later). 

A similar company that you may have heard of is Livongo ($LVGO) which was just acquired Teladoc ($TDOC) at the end of last year. At the time, Livongo’s revenue was about 4x higher than Ontrak’s current revenue, and they had a lower EPS of -$0.26. And the deal valued Livomgo at $18.5 billion! Up to the merger, $TDOC and $LVGO were up 153% and 431% YTD, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** They are an in-person and telemedicine B2B provider that uses AI to address behavioral health and substance abuse in order to prevent other, more serious conditions. They have a very high growth potential and are a prime target for acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

Ontrak, Inc. is a small company. With a market cap of only $506M, they are unfortunately (fortunately?) too small for me to post about them on WallStreetBets. They have impressive financials, however, and have shown consistent improvement over the past 5 years. They just pre-released 2020 Q4 financials on March 1, and the full earnings report is scheduled for March 9.  EPS of -$0.07 beat expectations of -$0.30. Revenue for the full year of 2020 was $82.8 million, representing a 136% increase from 2019 and a CAGR of 120% since 2017. They have also continued to show considerable improvement in all valuation, profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. Their balance sheet is strong too, as they are sitting on $86.91M in cash. And here are the other highlights from their March 1 press release:

&amp;#x200B;

* Record Quarterly      Revenue of $29.3 million in Q4 2020, up 149% year over year and up 22%      from Q3 2020
* Operating loss of $1.8      million in Q4 2020, a 74% improvement year over year
* Record Quarterly      Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million in Q4 2020, achieving quarterly positive      Adjusted EBITDA for the first time
* Full Year Revenue of      $82.8 million, up 136% Year over Year
* 2021 Outlook revenue of      $100 Million
* Raised $44.9 million in      Q4 2020, $41.4 million net of related fees, by completing a second      offering of Non-Convertible Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock

&amp;#x200B;

**Why the drop?**

$OTRK is currently down around 74% from its 52-week high of $99.89 reached on January 27, was downgraded by a few analysts yesterday, and so far four law firms have announced that they are “investigating” the recent drop. This all seems to come from the typical playbook of the shorts, and I expect more negative news to come. There was a catalyst, however I believe the shorts are hiding behind this and using it to induce an overreaction. It also wouldn’t surprise me if some of the top holders are involved so they can make a quick profit and increase their long position. 

The catalyst was their announcement in their March 1 press release that they have lost their biggest customer, Aetna. From the release, Aetna is focused on “the lowest possible cost per medical visit, and not on clinical outcomes data or medical cost savings, which were meaningful and significant.” So as I mentioned earlier, this model conflicts with the goal of maximizing short term profits.  This is huge news, as Aetna provides 64% of their revenue, but the contract doesn’t expire until June 26 and the company is hoping to rebound quickly.  As the CEO mentions in the release, “We have a strategy in place to regain the Ontrak-A business and are *currently in late stage discussions with other customers* whose metrics align with our value proposition of an integrated approach to whole health that delivers an average ROI of 3.7, average cost savings of 40% to 50%, and durable clinical outcomes with exceptionally high program retention and member experience scores. Collectively, we have a *market opportunity of over $30 billion*.""

This news did cause Ontrak to adjust their estimated 2021 total revenue down to $100M from their previous estimate of $165M. This is a sizable decrease of 39%, however the stock is down almost twice that amount. $100M is also still an increase of 21% from 2020 revenue, and they project to return to 100% revenue growth in 2022. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** The company just lost their biggest customer, and revenue estimates have fallen significantly. The market has overreacted, however, indicating investors believe more customers may leave as well. Company guidance seems to indicate the opposite and projected financials are still strong. Trading at a huge discount IMO.

As I said, Ontrak is a very small company. They are shorted 34% of float (4.76 short ratio), but that only represents 2.52M shares as their float is only at 7.2M. That’s lower than the total amount of WSB subscribers and only 3 shares per member of r/stocks! This could be a stock where our community actually does have some power. And while the shorts have succeeded in the past few days, there are currently only 250k shares available to borrow ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/OTRK](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/OTRK)). 

One company involved in the shorting is Culper Research, who used to often short companies in tandem with our favorite, Citron Research. They tried shorting $OTRK last year but failed miserably, and it looks like they are at it again ([https://twitter.com/CulperResearch/status/1366395871877877765](https://twitter.com/CulperResearch/status/1366395871877877765)). While there are some legitimate concerns, it’s hard to see any of them as a “death knell” as Culper puts it. Culper recently shorted (a stock that I can't mention here due to market cap) which drove the stock price down over 35%, however that company has responded with an investigation of their own (we’ll see if anything actual comes out of it). Sure, shorts play an important role in the market, but Culper seems to be one of those really nasty companies that tries to push companies to bankruptcy with baseless claims that their targets are completely “worthless.” I can’t find any evidence yet, but there are rumors that Culper actually lobbied Aetna to terminate their contract with OnTrak. There are also rumors that OnTrak is still in talks to retain Aetna (please share if you have any info on this!).     

Total shares outstanding is 17.54M. 28.3% of those shares are owned by institutions, the top holders being big names like ArrowMark, Credit Suisse, Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and our other favorite, Citadel. That number has grown significantly in the past few months as well (22.67%), and as we all know these guys don’t lose often. Even if the shorts cover their positions, and no squeeze is forced, these institutions should be increasing their positions now that it is trading at a discount to what they just recently paid. 

57.4% of shares are held by insiders and even with the recent rise, there have been no sales by insiders in over a year. The vast majority of insider shares, however, are all owned by the CEO, Terren S. Peizer (just under 9.2M shares). This amount of control is a little concerning, and I honestly can’t tell if Mr. Peizer is a genius or a scam artist (if anyone has more info on him I would love to hear it). On the other hand, it does give him a lot of incentive to maximize the share price and he has no reason to sell right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** Possible short squeeze, great long term outlook. High ownership by CEO and large institutions. Extremely low float means little volume needed to move the stock – could help with a squeeze, or be a trap, but just one subreddit or one whale could do a lot of damage here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My Position**

Shares continued to drop this morning and spent the day hovering between $26 and $28. It closed just over $26, and if it breaks downwards again tomorrow, my next target is around $20. Call volume is very bullish right now though and it looks extremely oversold. I really like the chances of a strong reversal here, so I opened a position of 140@26.95 today. Just one new customer could bring this back up to it previous ATH, and an acquisition could push it even higher.",stocks,"DD for $OTRK - low float/possible squeeze, trading at a discount with solid long term outlook",33.0,0.77

They buy more shit instead of investing. Business owners spend money directly in businesses to expand, build more stores, build more factories, more robots, etc. All that money has to come from somewhere. Usually it’s the stock market.

Think of Pepsi and Coke. If the price of Pepsi goes down, everyone is going to spend less money on Coke because Pepsi is now way cheaper. Right? That’s easy shit we all took the same dumb economics class in high school. Probably all got the same analogy too. 

But price isn’t the only variable, there’s also the return. Going back to the sodas, let’s say Pepsi and Coke cans stay the same price, but Pepsi doubles the size of their can. Now your return is twice as high for buying a can of Pepsi. So why would you buy Coke? Even if Coke was everyones favorite, some people are still gonna switch to Pepsi just because the Pepsi can is so much bigger. It feels like a better deal. 

Stocks and bonds are exactly like Pepsi and Coke. Bond rates going higher means a better return on bonds. So bonds are now twice the size and come with way more soda, whereas stocks are just as expensive as they were 3 months ago. That leaves a lot of stock drinkers rethinking their lives. Some of them will make the switch. It’s unavoidable.

Don’t panic or worry about it. The bull market is going nowhere long term. But know that your stock picks are going to start to matter a lot more. You can’t just pick anything. People are going to be more careful about the stocks they buy, now that they can get so much *bond soda**somewhere else.",stocks,ELI 5. This is why treasury yields (bond rates) matter. A lot,27.0,0.7

I made a post about this Friday. And I feel I embarrassed myself and need to justify properly. Although I’ll keep it posted cuz it’s funny to me. 

-Chipotle does have 2100 stores. There was about 11% increase in sales year over year... They managed a way to grow sales through deliveries to meet new highs while 40% of there stores were closed. (In other words, They defeated the pandemic.) 

They said they plan to use this to their advantage and want to experiment with online only stores. Cutting down a dining room expense. And I feel if those can work. That would make their margins higher. 

-Speaking of profits, something that I REALLY liked about chipotle. Is that they do not franchise to independent owners, meaning all profits collected comes straight back to the company. (McDonald’s has franchised tons of locations over the years and collects 4% commission of all revenue. But there’s always a owner collecting all the fat net proceeds.) 

-Chipotle is a different style of food. And I do not see many (fast food) chains capable of competing.
 
-Very small menu about 4 items No desserts. I like how their keeping it simple for now.
 
-Targeting both indulging clients as well as health fanatics with cauliflower rice which packs minimal carbs.

*Live Updates*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

kissin_frogs,0.0,29.0,"This is a discussion for the people who were following the USPS contract drama. Everything that I am posting here is partial speculation. I am more than happy for you to shit on my post or downvote me to oblivion. I would just like to kindly ask you to post your positions.

**(Full Disclosure: I still have 4/16 115 Calls)**

I have put TLDR's in the beginning and after each key paragraph because I know you are all lazy cunts.

**(TLDR: WKHS was on the brink of going BK, so there was massive manipulation in the market to make sure the suits would lose less money.OSK was thrown as bait, causing its price increase from the USPS contract to fall straight back down. The reason is that OSK is a sustainable company with great financials and can withstand it.)**

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself. This is also based on my theories and speculation.

As some of you may know OSK (Oshkosh) was rewarded the USPS contract for the new fleet of vehicles. It was a contract for $480M to finalize production for next-generation Vehicles. The total contract can be worth up to $6B to supply 50,000 to 165,000 over 10 years. Once the news broke out, OSK went from ≈$103 to ≈$118 high. This is about a 14.5% increase in the value of the company, which is ≈ 1B in market cap value. With OSK’s TTM revenue of 7.2B, it gave them a multiple of revenue of ≈1.12x. The TTM EBITDA $668M, which calculates ≈ 11.9 times multiple. These multiples do not account for the projected revenue and EBITDA with the new USPS contract. The industry average on EBITDA multiples is around 13.8 times for manufacturing companies. The average multiple for auto &amp; trucking is 45.73 times, according to [NYU Stearns](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/vebitda.html). Without the projections of  EBITDA gains from the USPS contract, it is already extremely undervalued based on (Enterprise Value/ EBITDA).

**(TLDR: Even if OSK was at the all-time high of $118 per share, it was still undervalued by approximately 32 times, using TTM numbers (****No projections and based on USPS gains****). This is based on the auto and trucking industry standards for public companies. In other words, it didn’t matter if OSK got the USPS contract or not. It was still way undervalued.)**

I am screaming at the top of my lungs that OSK is undervalued, so you are probably wondering why OSK fell like a ton of bricks back to $104 when the News about **One House Democrat** cried foul play on the USPS deal. 

**Whatever I am going to say now is partially theory pulled based on available information online. I would love for anyone to call me out if I may be wrong but post your positions also.**

This is where Workhorse plays a big role in the movement of OSK stock. As some of you might have noticed, WKHS’s value dropped by nearly 50% after it was announced that OSK was awarded the contract rather than WKHS. Some may agree and some might disagree, but WKHS was banking on the contract to essentially survive. In other words, it was a Hail Mary that would have saved them from all their struggles. I am not going to go into enterprise value and EBITDA ratios with WKHS or any of that because they only have a TTM revenue of ≈500K. You read right 500k not 500M. It would just be a waste of my time.

This is really scary because WKHS has a lot of debt on its books. As of 9/30/2020 WKHShad a net debt of $123.228M. Additionally,[ WKHS raised an additional 200M](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-gets-200-million-to-advance-electric-van-production). This adds up to around 323M in debt, assuming they did not pay any off from 9/30. There was no way for WKHS to service that debt without bringing in new revenue. If they are not able to service the debt based on historical numbers, how are they going to service the new debt? The Creditors approved debt as they were betting on WKHS getting the USPS contract. WKHS had some really good investment bankers, or the underwriters need to be fired because this was pure speculation, which is a big bet for debt financing. As the news came out two days ago that OSK was awarded the contract, WKHS went tits up. Even though the terms on the loans did not require WKHS to repay Debt until 2024, creditors felt the pressure as WKHS lost the contract. Additionally, the value of the company decreased by half, leading to any debt convertible to stocks being less valuable. If creditors do not feel that a company is capable of serving a debt, they can recall the loan anytime (Correct me if I am wrong). This probably was going to happen. They were flirting with [insolvency](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workhorse-share-collapse-raises-pressure-131704051.html), and all their investors would have lost their investment. The largest investor before all this drama was not ARK. It was your big institutions and mutual funds ([ie. Blackrock Inc., Vanguard Group, Inc. (The), and Seaport Global Asset Management, LLC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WKHS/holders?p=WKHS)), and they would have lost a lot of money.

**(TLDR Paragraph: WKHS was close to being insolvent if creditors decided to pull the plug. They had all the reason to with WKHS losing the race for the USPS contract.)**

**(Disclaimer: this is Speculation and Theories)**

What does this have to do with OSK going down? They both have the same largest institutional investors backing the stock ([Blackrock and Vanguard](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/holders?p=OSK)). Within a day after the news that Blackrock would have lost ≈$185M in value and Vanguard would have lost ≈$137M, assuming they did not sell any shares after 12/31/2020. They both would have made only ≈70M from the OSK stock price jump. This leaves them with the choice of the small gain from OSK or large losses from WKHS. If these institutions let WKHS sink, they would have lost all their investment, which was approximately an additional $150M for Blackrock and $100M for Vanguard. These are just calculations for 2 of the institutional investors. It is clearly a larger cost for institutions letting WKHS go BK without some gains rather than letting OSK jump up from the news. The Creditors also would have lost a lot of money if this were to happen as there will be unserviced debt and a loss in value in the convertible stocks. Even if OSK went down, the suits would not have lost much money because OSK can sustain itself without the USPS contract. With OSK’s management, OSK has grown year over year. This is not just enterprise value. They grew revenue and EBIT every year before the Covid since the CEO has been in place.

**(TLDR Paragraph: Big money and Creditors would have lost big by letting WKHS go BK. It is okay for OSK to fall in the short term because it is undervalued and they proved they can grow year over year.)**

This where a lot of manipulation might be happening behind the scenes. There was a bunch of shorting and options activity during this time. This was probably institutional investors hedging their bets to make up for losses. For example, ARK bought multiple dips on WKHS as the stock plummeted from the news. They nearly doubled their position. By the timing of god himself, news came out merely hours claiming House Dem will push back hard on USPS decision to choose OSK. This is apparently one House Democrat crying foul play, not the whole house, where the title tries to mislead you into thinking. Since OSK was linked to the USPS contract, it fell with regards to the news. In my opinion way too much as I believe it is extremely undervalued. There might also be additional selling to exacerbate the WKHS dump. As I finish writing this, WKHS was a clear buy and sell scheme with news that was over-exaggerated and probably paid for to minimize huge losses that would have come with WKHS insolvency. The people who would bear the pain are people who believed that WKHS is a good company. I have seen people comparing WKHS to Nikola, stating how it was undervalued compared to each other. What they don’t understand is that they were comparing garbage to garbage. With this belief that Woods can do no wrong, a bunch of people jumped over the cliff.

(TLDR Paragraph: OSK had to take the fall for WKHS while the markets were manipulated to prop up WKHS, so the suits would not have to take as big of a loss. The pain was transferred to the retail investors as a sea of retailer investors followed Cathie Woods into buying the dip.)

So the stock I hold 23 shares of, at a modest cash value this stock has risen significantly and while a little volition generally is holding or growing.
With a good profit currently sitting there what should I do?
cash out some of this profit? ie. sell back down to original investment amount but will limit future profits 
Keep it all where it is? Hold and see what happens.
Invest more? Have to say not keen on this option
Or
 Sell it all, quit while I’m ahead,and put into a slower growing but more stable ETF tracker?

TLDR; I like the stock. I like 1 shot. I like easy logistics. I like tested against variants. I like high protection against ‘prevented deaths and hospitalizations’. I like potential up-swing with vaccine approval. Don’t like lower overall effective % vs competitors. Don’t like rumored production limitations.





First off, I hope everyone out there is staying safe during these crazy times. I’ve been learning a lot from being a lurker on here these past few months of quarantine/semi-quarantine life.

Now, let’s get to the point. I’m BULLISH on Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ). A bluechip, long-standing American-based company founded in 1886, no.37 on F500, huge portfolio, nice dividends - shit ain’t goin’ anywhere. 

In my opinion, JNJ’s upcoming vaccine will be a big step in the battle against COVID worldwide. I believe it has a lot of upside versus its competitors. JNJ has a large pool of resources and plenty of support from the Biden administration.

JNJ’s vaccine is currently awaiting emergency authorization approval (hopefully by the end of the month), but everything seems to be looking good and vaccines are already being produced with partner $EBS. JNJ’s vaccine has a lot of advantages in the production/logistics dept., which is currently a problem for other vaccines. Things things I like:

-Vaccine takes only 60-70 days to produce (Pfizer is 110 days)

-JNJ vaccine can stay in STANDARD FRIDGE temperatures for 3 MONTHS (compared to sub-zero vaccines)

-JNJ says 100m vaccines by this summer, probably making millions/billions more in foreseeable future (rumored production limitations)

-SINGLE DOSE, easy logistics

-More effective versus variants

-65% effective overall but 85% EFFECTIVE PREVENT SEVERE CASES

-Worldwide demand

-JNJ taking same technology for vaccines/trials fighting against Ebola/HIV/Zika/more

$JNJ and a lot of the healthcare industry are currently trending upward. I’m hoping it runs up short-term with vaccine approval later this month. Long-term BULL attitude as well, taking COVID vaccine tech and fighting other diseases. Safe investment, good dividends, potential short-to-mid term upside. 

There is also a lot of MSM support with strong projections:

https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=JNJ#:~:text=The%2016%20analysts%20offering%2012,the%20last%20price%20of%20166.79.

This is purely speculation. I am an idiot. I just want us all to be safe, happy and make tendies. 

Currently poor-ish and in for 10 @ 163. Hopefully buying more.

# Ticker Info/Position

Ticker: $MILE (formally $INAQ who acquired/merged officially last Thursday)

Stock Price as of 15th Feb: $17.29

Current Mkt Cap: [projected a $1.3b](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132624/0/en/Metromile-a-Leading-Digital-Insurance-Platform-to-Become-Public-Company.html) \- they only just went public and I think their previous 570m cap was from INAQ thus incorrectly reported.

TLDR at the very bottom. My position is 76 shares @ $18.26. It's all I have spare right now as all my other long funds are tied up in BB and NIO, but plan to load up more at the end of the month.

# Notable Investors and Ownership

* A ""Shark Tank"" has collectively invested $160m, including *Social Capital,* *Miller Value,* *Clearbridge,* *Hudson Structured,* *Mark Cuban,* *and* *New Enterprise Associates*

# Who are MetroMile?

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience.

**Longer description from MM themselves:**

&amp;gt;Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation.

**Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar?**

That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market.

# Product Highlights

* Cancel your coverage any time
* All measured and tracked through a innovative mobile app and dongle (note, this dongle also aids in the recovery of stolen vehicles - they claim they have a 92% stolen vehicle recovery rate)
* The app/dongle also monitors your car's health (engine issues etc) and can help avoid parking tickets with the street sweep feature

* Try before you buy - their FREE Ride Along app analyses your driving and allows you to calculate what you could save and then convert into a real customer, they claim 11% of abandoned quotes online then go onto try Ride Along. The app in general has a 25% referral rate and a 20% conversion rate which is HUGE.
* Their tech allows enhanced detection of fraudulent claims which lead to a +10% improvement to their contribution margin: Algorithmic Accident Reconstruction replaces manual investigation, More potential fraud cases identified, More potential cases successfully investigated, More confirmed fraud

# The Numbers

|\-41.2m|\-42.8m|\-24.8m|\-20.7m|\+3.1m|\+87.1m|\+225.0m|

*(if this is tricky to read on mobile, they are forecasting hitting +$3.1m in 2022 and then rocketing to +$87m in 2023 and +$225m in 2024)*

# How good are the team behind it?

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from [MetroMile's website](https://www.metromile.com/about-us/) and not my words, but they looks impressive.

**CEO Dan Preston:**

&amp;gt;*Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal.*  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;*Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science.*

**CTO Paw Andersen:**

&amp;gt;*A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies.*

**And then Founder &amp;amp; Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin:**

&amp;gt;*Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health &amp;amp; vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data.*

# Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts

* They are currently operational in **just 8 of 50 U.S. states**; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
* They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and **49 in 2022**
* Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing **$160B in potential premiums** (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30)
* The IPO transaction has provided an estimated **$294 Million in cash** to pursue growth opportunities
* They are looking to **expand and cross sell into other verticals** such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties &amp;amp; Maintenance through 2021-2022
* They are **licensing their leading AI claims platform** and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below)
* They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and **one of them is** [**FORD**](https://www.fintechfutures.com/techwire/metromile-and-ford-team-up-to-bring-highly-personalized-car-insurance-to-ford-owners/), they expect **8 by 2022** so keep an eye out for announcements
* There are ambitions to go global
* In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations ([Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146566/0/en/Metromile-Raises-Policies-in-Force-and-Contribution-Profit-Expectations-for-Full-Year-2020-Provides-Update-on-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Metrics-and-Reaffirms-Outlook-for-2021-20.html)), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon

# NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth

This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their [MetroMile ENTERPRISE](https://enterprise.metromile.com/) arm of the business, and its **built to work on top of standard claims management software**.

* This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 &amp;gt; $21.7m 2022 &amp;gt; $33.7m in 2023 &amp;gt; $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also **a** ***software/technology company***
* It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline.

# What about the competition?

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is [Root](https://www.joinroot.com/test-drive/), however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile.

Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical.

On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

# The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns

* A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included
* In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road ([Source](https://www.gocompare.com/motoring/reports-statistics/coronavirus-travel-report/)), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual *(YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world)*
* A survey shows after the pandemic **25% of drivers** plan to drive less: [Source](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-8260957/A-fifth-motorists-claim-theyll-drive-lockdown.html) *(sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees)*
* OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows **US mileage dropped by as much as 60%** during the height of the pandemic last year: [Source](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/06/851001762/the-pandemic-emptied-american-roads-but-driving-is-picking-back-up?t=1613224790884) \- the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends
* **22.7% of employed Americans** were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/americans-are-driving-less-than-before-pandemic-and-it-s-permanent)
* When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations.

Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay.

# Cons/Watch Outs

* The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness.
* The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out
* Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector
* Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out)
* Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche
* For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there

***""Buffet had Geico. I choose MetroMile""*** \- Chamath Palihapitiya. Go and read Chamath's one pager here: [https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1331278297930428417](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1331278297930428417)

This is not a swing trade, this is not that P&amp;amp;D shit, this is a buy early, hold and ride the wave of a growing company built on great tech, a great team and a great business model. Here's your TLDR; read it properly and actually make a decision for yourself because I feel this is a sleeping giant just waiting to explode.

$INAQ's share price jumped from around $9 pre acquisition announcement in December to around $17 today. However since completing the merger on Wed 10th Feb 2020 and the ticker renaming to $MILE the price has barely moved, dipping a dollar or so and maintaining pre merger completion levels. I feel like the market are really sleeping on this and they are flying under the radar so I am getting in now before they reach their potential. I like the stock, I have a lot of confidence in it.

EDIT: I’ve drafted this over the weekend, the price is now up to $19.50 at this present moment. Looks like the market are waking up to the new ticker.",stocks,$MILE / MetroMile - here is why I am getting in early to this InsureTech disruptor,30.0,0.92
cdurgin,0.0,28.0,"In the last week or two we've all seen a lot of unbridled optimism for the future of weed, THC, and CBD products.  For good reason too, it's a yet untapped market that could very well rival that of alcohol in the next decade or two with plenty of potential in the medical field as well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't think the money is going to flow how people are hoping it's going to flow.  I've made a few examples with some of the issues I foresee.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  We have a great Canadian company showing strong growth and revenue.  First, lets assume that they decide there isn't too much more room for growth in Canada and they'll be better off selling to America.  First problem I see is that imports are going to be a nightmare.  Whatever the taxes and tariffs that are decided on are going to be heavily in favor of domestic production.  It's going to be at least a decade before America has much interest in exporting THC so the normal check and balance of retaliatory tariffs just wont be there.  The only way I see this not being the case is if there is some major player I'm unaware of who, for some reason, is unable to sell in Europe and decides to lobby against it.  They might as well start up a domestic production in America.
2. A ""start up"" in America who has lots of experience and a record of success in America (despite totally not having any since it would be against the law of course).  Finally things are really starting to look up!  Traditional loans are now an option, credit cards can be used, investors are beating down your door!  Only step you have to do now is get licensed!  No problem, you've been trough this before.  Only this time things are a bit different.  You resubmit all of the forms you completed before, but two are new, FDA approval and ATF approval.  The FDA approval is mercifully short, but you could tell it would be an absolute nightmare if you were trying to sell anything other than a joint; potential years of drug trials, QA certifications, licensing fees for specific strains, rigorous standards for ensuring THC and CBD content is as advertised, the list goes on and on.  Even the ATF form wasn't too bad, a few fees and such here and there.  Only one checkbox remains ""have you or anyone in your company that you know of consumed, sold, or had business dealings with others involving marijuana prior to legalization"".  It is clear that checking this box triggers and investigation, not checking it stops approval.
3. The Canadian company is 1. was lucky, the only Americans they knew before legalization were on hockey teams, so they can check this box without worry.  After a brief two month investigation, they are approved to begin growing.  They find some farmers that never grew marijuana before legalization (since most of the experience ones have been arrested or fined into bankruptcy) give them the tools and the training.  Only thing now are the seeds.  Before you can even ship them the farmer tells you ""don't worry, we'll order them from Monplanto, I have a contract with them and am only allowed to plant their seeds.""  After a while they find someone new who can plant the seeds you want, mercifully just before new regulations on seed imports are released.  Finally, all the hoops have been jumped and fees payed and through no small miracle, finally get your product to market.  There is a just one final obstacle to success, a punishing 30% tax.  Both the state and the feds now have a high tax, and you see your profit margins dwindle.  Thankfully they are still there, and you sell your pack of 5 joints for $80.  One more problem, there's a pack of 20 spliffs (have weed half tobacco) sold for $30.  You see, their product is being taxed at almost half the rate yours is since the tax is based on TCH/CBD concentration, and they are happy to sell at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

All three of the situations have something in common that I think we can count on.  The deck is heavily stacked against new companies.  We've already seen this happening to a lesser extent in states with partial legalization and when congress gets involved, I doubt that it will get better.  You might be asking ""If there are no real current THC businesses, who would want to prevent new businesses from starting?"".  Tobacco.  That's who.  

They all know they are in a slowly dying industry and need to get out.  What better way to get out than to give yourself a competitive advantage in a brand new industry that's basically identical to your current industry.  What I would do in their shoes is use my well established team of lobbyists to get the bar set so high that it costs at least 10 million just to play in the game while stacking the deck in my favor against those who can.  Then, use my connections to ensure that I am the first one on the field.  Once I'm there, I'm going to sell at a loss.  I'm already rolling in cash from big investors so 5 years of missed profits? not an issue.  Tobacco is still covering the losses.  Get the people used to the price and then the only competition is people selling ""luxury"" products.  Prices can be raised over time once the market is cornered for you and yours.

If I were to invest in weed, I wouldn't be looking at foreign companies or legally gray American ones.  I would be looking at the major players who have billions to gain and almost nothing to lose.  The ones with money.  My personal pick is  Altria Group (owner of Marlboro amongst others).  We know they are very interested in marijuana and are actually a proponent for legalization.  Rather curious, since it would most likely hurt sales in most of their subsidiaries.  They would only be there if they felt they had a lot to gain.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  I don't think anyone selling somewhat legal weed in America will survive federal regulation, I don't think anyone outside of the US will be able to sell to the US, I don't think any new company with a market cap under 1 billion will survive the first 5-10 years of being forced to sell at a loss to compete.

baabaablacksheep4,0.0,26.0," I have a theory about what is going on in the market. 

As a result of uncertain financial conditions during 2020 and the Gamestop event in 2021 there has been an explosion of people interested in investing in stocks. One metric to measure this is by looking at subscribers to the investing subs on Reddit. 

WSB (\~800K Jan 2020 to \~8.8M Feb 2021): [https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets](https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets), Stocks:  (\~473K Jan 2020 to \~2.17M Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/stocks](https://subredditstats.com/r/stocks), Investing (\~880K Jan 2020 to \~1.6M Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/investing](https://subredditstats.com/r/investing), Penny Stocks (\~130K Jan 2020 to \~1.1M Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/pennystocks](https://subredditstats.com/r/pennystocks) Day Trading (\~45K Jan 2020 to \~370K Feb 2021) [https://subredditstats.com/r/daytrading](https://subredditstats.com/r/daytrading) ...

The list goes on and on. You get the picture.

In addition, with a lot of people still working from home, stimulus checks, entertainment venues (and restaurants and bars) being closed and the K-shaped recovery we have a lot of wealthier people stuck at home during the day who have extra cash. In essence, there are a lot of new investors with time, money and access to a personal computer. There have been a lot of articles about the K-shaped recovery: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/10/24/three-charts-show-a-k-shaped-recovery/?sh=3ebea945305f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/10/24/three-charts-show-a-k-shaped-recovery/?sh=3ebea945305f), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/how-a-k-shaped-recovery-is-widening-u-s-inequality-quicktake](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/how-a-k-shaped-recovery-is-widening-u-s-inequality-quicktake) etc.

My theory, and here is where it is just a theory, is that there are a lot of new investors who do not have the trading experience or fundamental analysis skills to judge valuation of a company and its stock price, essentially whether a company is fundamentally strong or not\*. Thus, you are seeing these massive runups for stocks beyond GME where fundamental analysis has been thrown out the window. Balance sheets, whether company actually sells something, cash flow, strength of the management, do not really matter because if you heard about it on twitter it could be a good buy. Essentially any stock that gets hyped is becoming a meme stock.

**I’m calling this EcoNOMNOMics theory**\*\*. Basically, when you have a lot of inexperienced investors they are essentially like children who will NOM on anything sweet given to them regardless of the fundamental value of the thing they are eating (nutrients, macros, is this actually good for me? Etc.). They experience the sugar high of seeing the stock shoot through the moon until it crashes like blood sugar but then they still want more so its on to the next stock.

Right now, it’s all about figuring out what the next cookie is. 

\*You might argue that the true valuation of a company is going to be different depending on how you measure it...is it assets and liabilities balance, revenue, strength of the product etc. Some people believe the value of a stock is determined solely by supply and demand (i.e. its worth that much if people are willing to pay that much). I realize this is tricky territory.

Bl1zza,0.0,24.0,"Clover Health stock price has gone way beyond the limits of stupidity. I know the markets can be irrational, but this is something else. 

So Clover has been nosediving eversince the Hindenburg short-report (or hitjob). Hindenburg is probably best known for their short report on Nikola (credits to them on that one), but everyone knew that Nikola was all show and talk before their report so idk how much credit that brings them. They’ve shorted a bunch of companies the past year and most of them are up over triple digits since their short reports.

Anyways, even though Clover is facing class action lawsuits, I do not see it as anything critical or fundamentals changing to either the company or the stock. Corporate lawsuits are as common in America as mosquitoes are in the swamps. 

Some basic info of the stock: P/S under 2, short interest ~30%, market cap barely above $1B, revenues will be close to $1B this year, revenue CAGR was 45,6% from 2019. 

Clover became public through the reverse merger route that shall not be mentioned here, under the ticker IPOC, one of Chamath’s blank checks. Chamath sees them as a disruptor in tha NA healthcare space. Whereas Clover’s closest competitors have growth rates of ~10%, Clover has ~50%. 

It’s understandable that Clover took a hit after the short report, but that in combination with the current blood-market, Clover’s valuation has dropped to laughable levels. The average price target for $CLOV is $14,33. That’s quite the jump from the current $7,82. And mind you that is a very conservative price target for a high-growth company (and a Chamath company). I personally expect this to recover back to the mid-to-high teens during the next couple of months and chase 30s or 40s by EOY. 

This obviously is a higher risk play, but because of the insane drop in the share price I believe the reward way outweighs the risk.

     Given the recent merge and ticker change from LGVW—&gt;BFLY, I’m here to discuss my thoughts on the stock and the product. This isn’t a classical DD post to say Cathy Wood this and Bill Gates that, which yes, to the moon etc. Honestly I’m sure one of you can give much better DD on the stock itself. I mostly wanted to just hop on here and explain my experience with the  product, which so far my reviews are quite fantastic. 

I’m an MD anesthesiologist, chief resident currently and on my way out of residency soon (finally). I recently picked up a Butterfly iQ+ with... yes... gains I made from playing stocks with y’all. Sort of a graduation present to myself.   

For those of you who are unaware, Butterfly is famous for their handheld portable ultrasounds which are the most affordable in the industry by far and can connect to an Apple or android device such as iPhone to use as the screen. They are affordable because of a new technology that replaces the piezoelectric crystal(thing that makes the sound waves) in the probe with a chip, surprisingly not at the cost of quality). Just suffice it to say this is a huge deal, as previously we have carted around bulky  ultrasound machines to patient rooms which can include waiting on elevators or even struggling to find one in the first place. 

The iQ+ is a newer model of their original design that reduced the weight of the probe and added more features. So I buy the IQ+ for 2000$ and they have a subscription model for the advanced features such as saving images and certain probe modes, so I opt for the 1000$ lifetime subscription rather than the ~420$ a year thing. They also sell accessories such as cases and belt clips which are pretty neat, overpriced, but you kinda just buy them anyway at this point. All very sleek looking stuff including the wireless charger the probe comes with. It’s very easy to use, simple as plug in to your phone, open the app, adjust your mode with a simple scroll up or down, add some gain (brightness), and start scanning.

This thing has done for me what the calculator did to math.  Does anyone else remember their grade school math teacher saying “what if someday you don’t have a calculator” as reasoning for not letting you use one on the test? And now we all carry one with us everywhere we go even to the bathroom. Training in my specialty has been similar- placing IVs, arterial lines and other procedures with an ultrasound has often been met with “what if someday you don’t have an ultrasound available.” Well take that, now I carry one around in my pocket when I go to work.

This company is farrr ahead of any competitor in this space, no other product even comes close. And they’ve already demonstrated further improvement to the product with the iQ+ and new features that have been added to the app. I believe a superior product will carry this company forward, it’s potentially useful to millions of healthcare professionals and students around the world, almost all of whom don’t have one yet (probably don’t even know what they’re missing out on).

Butterfly network investment thesis:

Bull case:

Bullish on this stock as it has been on my watch list since I first heard about it about 3 years ago.  Ultrasound is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic modality in everyday medical practice - essentially becoming the new version of the stethoscope.  Physicians are now using ultrasound for bedside diagnostics in ways that were previously not possible.  Ultrasound machines historically have been prohibitively expensive and too large in size to be practically portable.  Most MD’s being in private practice have to purchase their own medical equipment.  Traditional ultrasound equipment have run around $30,000-$50,000 for entry level devices, the butterfly unit however costs $3000.  While image quality generated by the butterfly unit is not quite as good as the traditional unit, the differences in quality probably do not justify a physician spending 10x more on a traditional ultrasound unit. Furthermore I am confident that image quality will improve with further evolution of butterfly’s technology.  I believe that a portable ultrasound will be in the lab coat of every future medical  student within the next few years. 

I not only like their business model of selling affordable ultrasound units, but also the fact that they have subscription based cloud based image storage.  This not only provides secure medical image storage for physicians which is convenient as they do not have to worry about securing and storing medical images locally,  it also provides a recurring revenue model which will invariably increase with further product uptake.   Furthermore, I see a high likelihood of hardware updates being offered at intervals as technology improves.  


Bear case:

As I try to build a bear case to balance out my thesis, one thing to note in the SEC filing is that the Butterfly network is not currently profitable,  nor is there any guarantee that they will become so.  As such, there remains some reasonable degree of risk with this investment.

Secondly,  the Longview acquisition corps investor relations website really sucks.  There is very little information posted on the website in general which is a red flag from an investor perspective.  Furthermore, the only way to contact Longview’s investor relations is through an email link.  There is no phone number provided to contact anyone on the team.  

Lastly, there is always a risk the acquisition may not proceed as planned.  

Altogether I believe the investment in Longview Acquisition Corp with the ultimate aim of investment in New Butterfly Common stock represents a sound investment.

Every stock in existence follows an up/down trend line whether or not it's going bullish or bearish. It's been blowing my mind that this isn't really the case in the current market, red days are becoming fewer and fewer. Seems like every time I open my app, every stock (less a couple) is green.

I have broken down a few points as to why this could be happening.

* More people are at home and capable of day trading, thus more people are putting money into the market
* People are saving money by being at home. Money which would go towards transportation, retail purchasing, restaurants etc. is now going into other areas.
* Stimulus checks are technically a large sum of money being dumped into the net economy. Each time this money changes hands a small percentage will end up in the hands of a wealthier person. These wealthy people will likely put that money into investments.
* We are still seeing the effects of unlimited QE that given back in March/April. Technically, the ratio of a stock price to the total US net worth may be very similar now to what is was then. However due to the pumping of ""free money"" into the economy, the total amount of cash floating in the US economy would go up, inflating stock prices. This really sucks for anyone who hasn't been in the stock market, since this would have been the only way to increase your income to match the massive inflation that is currently occurring.

When would the stock market go down?

* When people need to take money out, duh. Could be to pay taxes which governments will inevitably raise to cover their debts.
* If the banks can't pay back their debts.
* The wealth gap between older generations and younger generations is AFAIK, higher then it's ever been. If money is being taken out by boomers faster then it is being replaced by millennials, it could cause a decrease in the market.

I wanted to open the discussion for people to poke holes in my shitty analysis. I wanted to see if there are any key factors I am missing.

Game = changed. The federal government expects to distribute 100 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine by the end of June, starting with 4 million this week. On top of the doses provided by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, that means a vaccine will be available to every American adult who wants one by the end of July. 

J&amp;J’s vaccine is only one dose and can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, so it’s ideal for use at drive-thru vaccination sites and with “transient population groups,” such as those on college campuses. 
It’s the Covid era, so you know there’s a “but.” The US is still dealing with new Covid-19 variants, particularly B1351, and the decline in case numbers looks like it’s plateaued. Plus, the J&amp;J vaccine’s effectiveness rate is a bit lower than the other two, so public health authorities are worried about people dismissing it as a second-rate option. 

Bottom line: The vaccine works really well and health leaders encourage everyone who’s eligible to get it.

“First, the order directs an immediate 100-day review across federal agencies to address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key products.  

1. APIs are the part of a pharmaceutical product that contains the active drug. In recent decades, more than 70 percent of API production facilitators supplying the U.S. have moved offshore.  This work will complement the ongoing work to secure supply chains needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Critical minerals are an essential part of defense, high-tech, and other products. From rare earths in our electric motors and generators to the carbon fiber used for airplanes—the United States needs to ensure we are not dependent upon foreign sources or single points of failure in times of national emergency. 

3. Semiconductors and Advanced Packaging. The United States is the birthplace of this technology, and has always been a leader in semiconductor development. However, over the years we have underinvested in production—hurting our innovative edge—while other countries have learned from our example and increased their investments in the industry.  

4. Large capacity batteries, such as those used in electric vehicles: As we take action to tackle the climate crisis, we know that will lead to large demand for new energy technologies like electric vehicle batteries. By identifying supply chain risks, we can meet the President’s commitment to accelerate U.S. leadership of clean energy technologies. For example, while the U.S. is a net exporter of electric vehicles, we are not a leader in the supply chain associated with electric battery production.

This is a play indirectly related to the way the world is going in favor of clean renewable energy. It’s been proven that EV’s at this moment in time have no benefit whatsoever on the environment, because MOST of the electricity that runs them primarily is made by burning coal. Doing this has an even worse effect on the environment than burning gas! companies like Tesla are genuinely concerned with the environment. I Read a story on a Russian nickel mine that polluted an entire river(which is literally now the color neon red) and Tesla stepped in to aid protesters against the mining operation. Despite nickel being in great demand, they did this out of concern. So clearly Tesla cares about the earth, and not just the illusion that they are helping the earth. Which leads me to believe that sooner or later there is going to be a major nuclear energy boom. Nuclear energy is the only renewable, zero emission energy that could ever possibly replace burning coal. This play is obvious, yet nobody has acted on it.

1. The e-commerce and cloud giant has had a $5 billion share repurchase program in place since February 2016, the last time Amazon bought back any of its stock was the first quarter of 2012, so the streak is 33 quarters of no stock buyback. But with the new ceo coming, he might change and start to repurchase the stock, remember before tim cook take over apple, apple did not give out any dividend, and then it changed. 

2. Prime member engagement keep increasing and prime membership is still growing yoy. All major product categories demand continue to raise across globally. 

3. Amazon high growing aws and advertising revenue streams are getting more profitable, the advertising division could keep growing and getting some market share from fb and google.  

4. Amazon bottom line is improving much better compared to analysts predictions, the last few quarters it beats expectations by a lot. With the covid situation getting more under control, the covid related expenses will mitigate, and amazon will be more profitable. 

5. Amazon delivery fleet is growing, I have seen my packages constantly delivered by amazon vans and contractors. In the future, amazon will be less dependent on USPS, fedex and UPS, and might even able to compete with UPS and Fedex. 

6. Finally the stock split, with the new ceo coming, this might become possible as well, this will be a positive catalyst that all investors want to see.

The Company in question is called Vuzix or $VUZI. I know its a cute ticker but these mofo's are tough. This stock is a real money maker. The first thing you'll notice is probably that it's gone up 300% in the last 3 months but ill explain everything including why thats awesome (hint: they got some sweet deals with big pharma)

&amp;#x200B;

So history time. They have been in business working on the frontline of technology since 1997. They've been developing VR technology for over a decade and hold 179 patens for VR lens, headsets, goggles, literally everything you can imagine they have a patent on. They also have patents on AR glasses and tech for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this important? Because most of the world arent VR gamers, and VUZI specifically targets VR thats not for gamers. Here's a quote from the link below: 

""In fact, there are already frontline health-care professionals around the world using Vuzix’s smart glasses, and the company’s list of health-care customers continues to grow.""  

They are producing technology that is actually being used in the field, and with the ever growing demand for VR for practical uses (ie NOT play withselves to virtual anime chick), VUZI is in prime position to slurp up market space and continue growing. I don't know about you but after I like to invest in companies that A. are actually making money and B. have a real product that is selling well.

&amp;#x200B;

How is their balance sheet you ask? A lot better now than it was a year ago. According to the article below they went from a negative 200k gross return to a positive gross 300k return in just one year which is pretty darn good.

&amp;#x200B;

The real shit though is found in AR. This is a market space that hasn't even begun to grow yet. Analysts are estimating that it will be a 77 billion dollar market by 2025 and VUZI is already tapping this market now!! If you go to their website which is the second link, you can see they offer glasses for warehouses and medical fields that can scan barcodes and determine what a product is which is pretty sick and definitely the stuff of the future. They also recently began developing sports wear AR goggles for skiing and more athletics wear is likely to come in the future.  I'm extremely optimistic about this company though. The best part is that it's on a little sale today. I'm actively looking to buy more but the premiums on the calls are a little high at the moment, so I'm loading on regular shares now.

TLDR: RIDE is a no brainer. Beta production is coming online and should be ready by march (57 vehicles). Over 100,000 preorders. Money from government. Crayons on charts point up. Boom.

**Who is RIDE**

Lordstown Motors Corp., an automotive company, develops, manufactures, and sells light duty electric trucks targeted for sale to fleet customers. It primarily develops Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. Lordstown Motors Corp. was founded in 2019 and is based in Lordstown, Ohio.

**What does all that mean?**

There is demand. There is cash with more cash coming from the government. There is celebrity investors pushing their products with skin in the game.

**Is this company real? Nikola did bad things.**

Nikola scared a lot of you from these SPACs claiming EV offerings. I don't know why anyone believed in them when they had nothing from near day 1.

But Lordstown is differnent. Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries. Lordstown is real.

**Something about crayons.**

I found this on Stocktwits. Do what you will with it.

(Apparently this subreddit doesn't allow images. The image showed a chart of RIDE about to bust put. We are in the middle of that price increase now).

I will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/08/2020) at $39.65 while RIDE is at $27.40. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.

**What makes them different**

Their biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).

**What does your crystal ball tell you?**

Absolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop. Too much money is in this and the company uses actual electric powered motors, and not the gravitation powered ones made famous by Nikola.

**Catalysts**

March will see [57 beta vehicles produced](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-start-building-beta-prototypes-of-endurance-pickup/). These will be used for crash tests and such, but more importantly, be sent to initial fleet customers for feedback.

April - ??? The Department of Energy will decide on the loan. I[t helps when you have a huge cheerleader in office (Tim Ryan).](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/lordstown-motors-is-riding-on-hopes-with-biden-and-ryan/ar-BB1dmEBd)

Some time this year we'll see the EV RV and Van designs/concepts.

September The beginning of live production.

**Price targets**

Using GM forward P/E and 4% margins on revenue, this stock will range between $33 and $198. The $198 assumes full capacity of 600,000 vehicles sold. $33 assumes the 100,000 vehicles sold yearly. I'm comfortable with $115 - $125.

Another question I had is I’ve heard around the internet that IPO’s tend to dip hard early on, do you lovely people usually wait for an IPO dip or do you try to get in right away?

Edit:  thanks for all the responses, obviously it’s extremely volatile market, didn’t mean to shoot sparks off haha but yes if the company is said to be worth between 5-29 billion this for me personally is a decent thing to look into.",stocks,Question about Roblox and IPO,23.0,0.74

This DD is about VFF – Village Farms International, a company in the Cannabis industry based in Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

Credit where credit is due (u/mfairview), I was originally introduced to this company by a DD on r/WallStreetBets (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld6zoc/village\_farms\_international\_vff/). I know I know – WSB is a casino! However, you can certainly find diamonds in there outside of those associated with hands. This isn’t a moon shot, this is a long term play, and thanks u/mfairview for the introduction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before we get started, a little about this stoned ape to give my background and better portray the perspective I am approaching this from: I have years of broad experience across various Operational/Supply Chain functions (Warehousing, Procurement, Demand and Supply Planning, Transportation/Distribution, Last Mile Delivery \[direct-to-consumer\], Logistics, Manufacturing, etc.) in multiple industries, mainly CPG. With that background and an education in Supply Chain Management, I consider myself a decent evaluator of the basics of a company – operational capabilities and basic financials. That is the main view from which I will be approaching this DD.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to more technical investing considerations and context regarding the overall stock market, I am lacking in the same depth of knowledge. I have been lightly investing for years, and only heavily got into it last March/April. Since then I have had some wins and learned some hard lessons, but am not knowledgeable enough to speak to these types of considerations. Hopefully someone else may be able to provide a follow-up to this initial analysis that goes further into this area.

&amp;#x200B;

I look forward to feedback and learning from the comments, I would greatly appreciate constructive criticism and to see other perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you came here for the DD. Here it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Company overview:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Village Farms International

* Year of Origin: 1987
* Country of Origin: Canada
* Industry: Cannabis / Produce

&amp;#x200B;

Village Farms International has been operating for 34 years, during which time they have become a roughly $200M revenue per year company (last 5 years) that has become a leader in North American greenhouse cultivation footprint (access to 23.7M square ft. of grow space) and expertise. This started with a focus on produce products (namely tomatoes), and led to a core competency built around large scale greenhouse management. Over the last few years beginning in 2018, Village Farms has seized the initiative to take advantage of their vast knowledge in greenhouse operations and enter the budding cannabis industry.

&amp;#x200B;

They initially entered the industry in a joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics called Pure Sunfarms. They have since bought the ownership stake from Emerald (in the last 2 months) and now have full ownership and control over Pure Sunfarms, with Pure Sunfarms CEO Mandesh Dosanjh reporting to Village Farms CEO Michael DeGiglio.

&amp;#x200B;

Cannabis operations timeline:

* May 2018: Began commercial production
* Sept 2018: Began Wholesale sales
* Sept 2019: Began Retail sales in Ontario
* Oct 2019: Began Retail sales in British Columbia
* Feb 2020: Began Retail sales in Alberta
* July 2020: Began Retail sales in Manitoba and Saskatchewan

&amp;#x200B;

By 2019, the company’s annual revenue of $206.9M had was made up of $62.3M from Pure Sunfarms cannabis sales. Cannabis has already become 30% of their business and that will only continue to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Unique competitive advantages:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Steady, experienced, and consistent leadership

* Their founder and CEO Michael DeGiglio has been leading the company since its inception in 1987, and their CFO Stephen Ruffini has been with them since 2009
* This executive team has been together for a long time and they intimately know their company, talent, and resources
* I consider this a temporary competitive advantage as many cannabis companies are currently developing and growing with new executives and employees from various backgrounds and experiences who may not have worked together before. This is not necessarily a slight and some companies will thrive from that environment, but generally it will take time for those organizations to develop the same level of operational synergies, expertise, and mission-focused cultures that Village Farms has had decades to cultivate

&amp;#x200B;

2. Decades of greenhouse grow experience

* Wealth of data / experience in collecting/tracking and applying plant yield data, which is a critical aspect of improving supply availability and quality for Cannabis companies (and any agricultural business)
* Head start on clean energy initiatives – most competitors are just trying to get plants in the ground and get revenue streams growing, their ability to fully embrace more advanced initiatives such as clean energy are likely years away
* This is not only socially and environmentally responsible, but can save on costs, and improve public opinion while opening doors to new partnerships with commercial customers who have stringent vendor requirements around energy consumption
* Already NA leader in grow space available with preexisting infrastructure, significant head start vs. competitors

&amp;#x200B;

3. Somewhat more protected from regulation/industry specific fears than their peers

* Revenue stream from original produce lines provides a safety floor of revenue
* While this provides a floor, when we look at their potential revenue growth soon, it will show that this floor is only really a good safety net now, and their growth will soon make revenue driven by legacy produce products a very small portion of their business
* Decades of experiencing navigating international trade, regulatory laws around food for multiple countries, etc. This experience will benefit them greatly compared to their peers in the cannabis industry who are brand new to this part of the game

&amp;#x200B;

4. Existing Retail relationships

* While they are building their own stores as well, their history suggests they will mainly position themselves to sell goods wholesale to other Retailers
* Existing partnerships with Walmart, Kroger, Publix, Costco, Albertsons, and more
* I’m not necessarily suggesting to expect Cannabis to be sold in those specific chains when Cannabis becomes legal in the US, but in years to come as federal legalization occurs in the US and the industry evolves to where you can buy Cannabis outside of specialized dispensaries, it may become more like alcohol (with varying laws by state, existence of dispensaries, product in Retail chains, and brewery-type experiences available as well)
* That existing experience and capability in developing, establishing, and maintaining relationships with major partners like those listed will benefit them even if the chains they have preexisting relationships with aren’t the major players in this category

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential obstacles/pitfalls:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transitioning identity of the company

* It can be a major, disruptive challenge to revolutionize the operational strategy and revenue drivers of a business
* Legacy employees may not be cut out as well for the new environment, or there can be frontline cultural resistance from employees in the field against the suits in the offices who are making these decisions
* You run the risk of alienating your legacy customers
* This can be worse if your main customers are not consumers but instead other companies, as is the case with Village Farms
* In that scenario, it is more likely that a small portion of your customers make up a significant portion of your revenue (the Pareto Principle), and disruption to some key customers would be a massive impact to revenue
* The best CEOs would position this as something along the lines of: “We have always had the objective of utilizing state of the art agriculture operations to deliver value to people’s lives through fresh and healthy organic products, and whether that is tomatoes, cucumbers, or cannabis, that is what we will continue to do.”

&amp;#x200B;

2. Competition in the industry

* 507+ federal license holders for Cannabis operations in Canada alone
* US MSOs (Multi State Operators) are not going to roll over and give up market share without a fight
* Behind on overall public awareness to companies like Trulieve, Tilray, and others

&amp;#x200B;

3. Overextending expansion efforts and compromising position in legacy markets

&amp;#x200B;

4. Not enough senior leadership with significant Cannabis experience/expertise

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My rebuttals to the listed pitfalls, in respective order:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. We are three years into the transition of this company, and if this obstacle was going to be a show stopper, I believe it would already have had its negative impact

* The recent play to purchase out Emerald and get a 100% stake in Pure Sunfarms was the last domino to fall on this concern for me as I researched the company. Their industry leading cost positions, aggressive expansion plans, and rapid rise in cannabis related revenue has displayed that they have not only pivoted their product portfolio successfully, but done so without disrupting the core capabilities of the company

&amp;#x200B;

2. This is a concern and there are Cannabis players who will not make it to the finish line, but there is a lot of room for specialization in this industry just like any other. 

* The global revenue growth potential for the industry is extreme and there is plenty of room for those who now how to position themselves well
* While this risk/concern may impact Village Farm more in some markets than others, especially as they aim to expand and increase the amount of competitors they are exposed to, their core business in Canada alone is already sufficiently impressive to be worth an investment opportunity by itself. More on that to come

&amp;#x200B;

3. This is a real risk that cannot just be explained away easily

* This is a company that can handle scale and complexity based on its 34 year track record and industry leading position in North America Cultivation space. There are still significant risks and capital investments required to expand in this industry, especially given the current regulatory state around the world
* As one example, expanding into Texas alone will require standing up a vertically integrated end-to-end business within that state alone, with uncertainty as to the timeline of exactly when and how the medical program will expand and eventually go fully adult use legal
* If the expansion of the Texas medical program expected later this year is not as wide ranging as anticipated, and/or the introduction of fully legal adult use legislation in the market takes many years to come, that will make the high operating expenses and fixed costs of this market a weight on the company’s overall P&amp;L until revenues and the ROI break even within the state
* Furthermore, there’s no guarantee their business competes as successfully as they’ve operated in Canada regardless of legislative impact
* And that was all just conjecture about Texas, not even mentioning Europe and Asia Pacific expansion plans
* This potential pitfall is the risk that concerns me the most

&amp;#x200B;

4. This does not concern me, as experienced business leaders can apply the same principles that drive success in one industry to another. Subject matter expertise certainly is important, but it isn’t the end all be all, there are different styles. Some senior executives are experts of their industry/product/service and lean on that expertise to be great leaders, others are experts in general business principles and good at listening to the industry/product/service experts who work for them, among other types of leadership philosophies. This leadership team makes up for what they lack in prior Cannabis expertise with agricultural expertise which is critical to this industry. I do understand if this is a larger concern for some, though I want to address a bit further why it is not for me, at the risk of redundancy:

* Consumer packaged goods are consumer packaged goods and commodities are commodities. Knowing your product, your target customers and demographics, your industry, and a myriad of other marketing/commercial considerations I could additionally mention are obviously critically important to success
* Even so, the most important aspects of leading a large modern business revolve around universal concepts that apply to all products/services and industries: fiscal responsibility, operational discipline, and clear value positioning/commercial strategy. Some companies do okay without those attributes as core competencies. I’m sure some even flourish – revolutionary products and visions can overcome many hurdles. But no company can rely on that for long term stability – guaranteeing continued revolutionary advances is by definition not possible, and revolutionary vision is generally derived from specific individuals. People leave companies. People die. Relying on revolutionary products or visions is not a successful strategy for true long term stability
* If you can create a fiscally responsible and operationally disciplined environment /organizational infrastructure within your business and partner it with revolutionary products or vision - you have an Amazon or an Apple. Village Farms International WILL NOT BE an Amazon or an Apple. Cannabis is a commodity (granted, a commodity that is benefiting from extreme growth due to emerging from essentially global prohibition) and if they had revolutionary vision, I’d imagine there would be more articles about Michael DeGiglio as an individual that I would have come across in my research (no disrespect intended - I’m sure he’s a swell guy and very intelligent given his resume and achievements)
* Based on my research, I believe this company has a clear understanding of its value positioning and commercial strategy, as well as the aforementioned and critical capabilities of fiscal responsibility and operational discipline. I will support these claims in the next section

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Outlook:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The main objective of publicly traded companies is to provide/increase shareholder value. The main way that is achieved is by increasing profit, although for companies in the growth category, increasing revenue can be more important in the growth phase to institutions and investors (see: Amazon for many years). To put it more simply, the three areas a company must focus on to provide/increase shareholder value are as follows, with a summary of my perspective on Village Farm International’s outlook for each area, with context:

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - Domestic**

* Most important metric for stock price over next couple years given growth industry status
* Stated goal from 1/21 investor presentation (link in references): “Goal to capture 20% market share in dried cannabis category and have #1 or #2 brand market share in each product category”
* “Dried cannabis”, or flower category, is the largest product category in the industry and made up \~33% of all US Cannabis sales in 2020 (as one example benchmark), so between that and their also ambitious targets for other categories, will use 20% market share target as a representative goal of theirs for the overall Canadian market

  

|**Year**|**Canadian Market Revenue (C$)**|**Pure Sunfarms Actual Revenue (C$)**|**Pure Sunfarms Target Revenue (C$) (20% MS)**|**Notes**|

| 2019A|C$1,190,156,000|C$83,000,000|C$238,031,200|7% market share in 2nd year of operations|
| 2020A|C$2,623,942,000|?|C$524,788,400|Actual market revenues for 2019 and 2020 (not projections)|
| 2021P|C$3,980,562,300|n/a|C$796,112,460|\*|
| 2022P|C$4,949,576,800|n/a|C$989,915,360|\*|

|2025P|C$6,500,000,000|n/a|C$1,300,000,000|Market projection from BDS Analytics|

\*Made up market forecast based on growing (with diminishing annual growth) from 2020 actuals to the 2025 market projection from BDS Analytics

&amp;#x200B;

* VFF market share from 2019 in Canada around 7%
* Based on the 7% actual and the 20% target, as well as BDS Analytics Canadian cannabis market projection for 2025, estimated 2025 revenues for Pure Sunfarms would be a range between $360M if market share remains flat to $1B if 20% market share is achieved
* That alone represents a range of 74% to 383% revenue growth versus total company 2019 revenue (growth measured from 2019 to 2025)
* Keep in mind that’s in Canada alone, ignoring expansion activity, AND ignoring revenue from their legacy produce business!
* Yes that’s a lot of growth potential, and this is a company that has the demonstrated experience and capability to handle that scale profitably (more on that in next section)

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - International expansion**

US

* Texas presence already established
* Not going to go into speculation here, but this is a massive potential market that is likely to expand its medical program significantly by the end of 2021
* Some articles in reference list below for those interested

Europe

* Ownership stake in DutchCanGrow in the Netherlands

Asia-Pacific

* Already operating in Hong Kong
* Targeting further expansion in China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and more
* Targeting expansion into at least 3 more countries in the region by end of 2021

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - Define value position and execute**

The core principles of the cannabis arm of the business are listed by the company as follows:

* The leading supplier of greenhouse grown produce in North America
* A producer of the highest quality product, which adheres to the highest food safety standards
* A low cost producer
* A daily supplier to customers
* A provider of excellence in customer service and logistics
* A business with a solid balance sheet
* Enhancing investor value through continual improvements in execution
* An employer with a dynamic environment in which employees can grow and prosper

&amp;#x200B;

They directly speak to building their value proposition on the main competencies we’ve already discussed: “low cost provider”, “continual improvements in execution”, “solid balance sheet”, “excellence in customer service and logistics”

* These are not sexy principles compared to a lot of the flash in a new industry like this, but they are proven winning principles
* Village Farms aims to be closer to a Walmart than a Nordstrom, and its own self awareness of how to best leverage and position its experience and resources is a sign of solid leadership and direction
* Village Farms will win on volume, scale, and efficiency, not marketing and pricing

&amp;#x200B;

**Increase Operational Productivity/Scalability (for various ops processes: decrease lead times, increase outputs, decrease labor requirements, etc)**

* Take advantage of historical competencies and economies of scale
* Greenhouse grow is their bread and butter, they are already at the cutting edge of cost management and productivity/efficiency for this industry. It may not be a permanent competitive advantage and competitors can catch up, but it provides a great head start and attracts partners

&amp;#x200B;

**Minimize Costs (procurement/purchasing pricing, inventory costs, labor costs, etc.)**

* Supporting above revenue growth will take significantly less new capital investment compared to competitors due to existing infrastructure
* Already have industry leading gross margin, per 1/21 investor deck (40%), as well as industry leading profitability
* Already lowest cost producer of flower among Canadian greenhouse/indoor growers
* Currently riding 7 consecutive quarters of positive net income and 8 consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Takeaways:**

I’m not going to speculate on stock value targets, I’m not a financial analyst and this isn’t financial advice. I like the company, and to quote DFV, I like the stock. I believe the company has strong fundamentals from an operational perspective. I want to invest in the success I believe this company will have, and I believe it will provide a significant ROI. I do not believe that all the growth the cannabis industry can and will experience is priced in to current valuations (although I would love to see other thoughts on that).

&amp;#x200B;

The stock price could go up in the short, middle, or long term. It could go down. Heck, it could even stay flat.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know, Jon Snow knows nothing, this isn’t financial advice, and I’m just a stoned monkey. I plan on holding for the foreseeable future (most likely years, while buying the dips) barring any unlikely circumstances (any of the discussed obstacles/pitfalls manifest in a critically damaging way, the company exits the industry and returns to focusing on its roots in produce, Michael DeGiglio besmirches Harrison Ford in any way, or something of the like).

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t a get rich quick target, this isn’t a moonshot, and this isn’t without risk. There will be ups and downs over the years, as this is still an industry that is very vulnerable to market fears and herd mentality impacting stock values significantly, regardless of underlying fundamentals. This is an investment play, a long term hold, a “trust the process” play. This industry has amazing global growth potential, it will stabilize eventually, but on the path there, the Greenfield expansion/Brownfield acquisition&amp;merger growth phase of this industry will shake out many of its less fundamentally sound players. As players shake out, as regulatory fears continue to be stoked, and other similar phenomena occur, there will be value fluctuations and there will be investors who get spooked and lose money. Don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. Don’t invest what you may need access to in an emergency. And don’t put your mental health at risk.

&amp;#x200B;

In an emerging industry that is rampant with companies tangled up in financial mismanagement, short term cash grabs at the cost of sound long term decision making, regulatory hurdles, and lack of defined strategic direction, Village Farms looks to be a potential sleeping giant. As the chips fall globally over the next 5-10 years within the Cannabis industry, companies will emerge that will become titans. While Village Farms may not ever be the most popular or well known consumer-facing cannabis business, it looks well positioned to carve out a valuable niche in the industry and create a lot of value.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the industry long term, I like the company long term, and I like the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: This DD and the assumptions involved are derived from high level information obtainable on the internet. I have never done business with this company, I have never been to Canada, and I don’t particularly like tomatoes (my apologies to the many tomato lovers I am sure I have disappointed, though I do like ketchup). The realities of the underlying assumptions may be very off base. Customer experience and product quality could be lacking, my assumptions regarding the more technical/market-based considerations may be incredibly naïve (or even flat out stupid), and I may truly be a stoned ape just banging his head against the keyboard.

So I'm near what I started with now. Before pointing fingers at my paper hands, do know I would be down another additional 10k if I didn't liquidate them. 

I grew somewhat numb to the loss, or thought I did, during the course of the past 2-3 weeks, and even yesterday, it felt like a good riddance. But today, with mostly holding cash, and with a weekend ahead, the loss is settling in. The frustration, the anger, the angst. They have succumbed me. All the gains accrued over the past six months, time needlessly spent on reading, checking the stock market, anxiety from losing, thrill from winning, all amounted up to absolutely nothing. Just evaporated. Can't concentrate on anything. Time just passes and I'm absolutely wasting it. And should we have the greenest day on Monday, I will be on the sidelines because I did not want to take a risk of losing anymore. 

Share some wisdom. How the eff do you cope and deal with this? I know there are plenty who are far worse place than I am, but that doesn't provide any consolation because this is the only time I've experienced something like this. So tell me. What do I do?

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? 

- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? 

- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.


## Investing in Internet Forums

In my view, Pinterest can be one of the most sound social-networking investments.  Let’s keep one question in mind:

&gt; Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution.

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

- Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
- Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
- Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
- Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
- Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways. I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.


## Searching 

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally. 

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times: 

Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)
Skincare ideas (Target)
Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)
Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie, etc)

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. 
Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design. 

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy _outside_ of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.


## The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security &amp; Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify or Wordpress.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. Vectors for user’s channels like Etsy, Zoom, or TikTok.
6. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.



## Summary

I believe Pinterest qualifies as an excellent investment. I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.


I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.

Blizzgrarg,0.0,23.0,"GOEV is an EV play that's mostly known for its unique ""skateboard"" technology. It's a platform that allows the company (and anyone who licenses it) to custom build their own EV vehicle. This tech and its plans to sell a subscription model of its cars in the future are what differentiate GOEV from the tons of other EV companies. In a world that is hot for EVs, having proprietary tech that allows others to get in on the EV building game easily is an extreme advantage.

**Here are the key points:**

1. This stock originally spiked in January when it was reported that AAPL had been in talks to invest in or possibly buy GOEV back in 2020. For whatever reason, nothing came of the talks back then.

2. AAPL then went on to have talks with Hyundai-Kia, which had partnered with GOEV to develop an all-electric vehicle based on the latter's platform. Whatever reason was for failure of the talks in point 1, it sure doesn't look like a problem with GOEV.

3. GOEV has hinted that there would be partnership announcements sometime in Q1, which we are approaching the end of right now.

4. Due to the overall market correction and EV slaughter over the past two weeks, GOEV has dropped from $19 to a cheap roughly $13 right now. Twice in the past when this stock hit the $12-13 range, Cramer has pumped it on Mad Money. From a technical point of view, we have BOTTOMED. Unless EVs continue to get killed or the market crashes more, I don't see this name going down further. The only real risk for me is that it continues to go sideways for some reason.

**Mechanics of the trade:**

1. Right now, March 19 call options are CHEAP. The 15 strike traded at an average price of 0.55 on Friday, which is crazy for a $2 OTM call on a stock that moves 50 cents to $1 every day on NO NEWS. These options have an expiry THREE WEEKS OUT. The April calls are about twice as expensive, but they are a good deal as well.

2. The above is insane for a stock that moves this much on nothing and is one catalyst headline away from immediately popping to $17+. If it's anything AAPL-related, I can't begin to imagine how high it might go.

3. As of 2/15, the short interest is 15.4%, which is honestly not much compared to the meme stocks, but this will provide more fuel in the upside direction if anything positive is announced.

[Array Technologies](https://ibb.co/C6nyVHY) went public in October 2020, raising more than $1 billion at a valuation of $2.8 billion (1). The company manufactures tracking systems for utility-scale solar energy projects (2). Array Technologies has completed more than 900 of these projects in the past 30 years (3).

Array mainly operates in the United States, generating 87% of their 2019 revenue in the country. More than 30% of U.S. utility-scale solar generation uses an Array product. Its second largest market is Australia at 8% of revenue (4). The company has installed its systems in 30 countries total (3). Its headquarters are in Albuquerque, New Mexico (4).

#Products
Array’s primary product is the [DuraTrack HZ v3 tracking system](https://ibb.co/vLccZPt). The DuraTrack platform works with the company’s SmarTrack software to automatically adjust solar modules in response to unique site terrain and weather conditions. SmarTrack is machine learning based, allowing significant adaptability (4). Note that Array’s combined DuraTrack-SmarTrack systems is currently its only product offering.

There are three main factors that influence demand for solar tracking systems:

**1. Levelized cost of energy (LCOE)**

Companies have no incentive to purchase tracking systems when the cost of the tracking system outweighs the value of the additional energy generation. This means tracking systems are only viable in areas with high electricity costs. Expanding the areas of viability requires decreasing the cost of the tracking system.

Array Technologies accomplishes this in a few ways:

* Less than 1 motor is in use per MW (5)
* A single tracker block maneuvers 32 rows with 100+ modules (5)
* Uses few moving parts and the design is quite simple (5)
* SmarTrack requires no additional sensors or hardware (6)

The above design choices allow Array to provide trackers that generate the highest amount of energy possible without major tracking costs. It is important to note that the most effective solar tracker on an energy basis is often not the most effective on a cost basis. Array seems to effectively balance between efficiency and product cost. In fact, the DuraTrack system is independently verified to achieve 6.7% lower LCOE than competitors (4).

**2. Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M)**

It is important that solar modules utilizing tracking systems have high uptimes so the cost of the tracking system is further recouped. Additionally, repair costs for tracking systems can make their purchase unappealing.

Array’s DuraTrack boasts a 99.996% uptime thanks to its few moving parts (7). The DuraTrack system requires no scheduled maintenance (5). Array provides several case studies proving the product’s durability, including its operation in the high-corrosion environment of Jordan (8).

DuraTrack’s durable design also includes a fully mechanical wind-load mitigation system. It is the only solar tracker to use such an automatic system without using sensors or electricity (4).

**3. Installation Labor and Costs**

Array Technologies lowered installation cost through 3 single-bolt module clamp designs. Notably, the company claims its RapidClamp design requires just 11 seconds per installation. Fast installation times greatly reduce the total cost of installing the DuraTrack system (7).

#Leadership and Ownership
Ron Corio ([pictured](https://ibb.co/c2Sf7Fg)) is the founder of Array Technologies and currently serves on the board, after being CEO from 1989 to 2018 (4). Corio is considered a pioneer of solar tracking as he is among the first to develop such a system (20). Corio holds 10% of the company's shares and is the second largest shareholder (10).

Mr. James M. Fusaro is the CEO of Array Technologies, serving in the role since Corio’s mid-2018 retirement (4). Previously, Mr. Fusaro served as President of Advanced Materials at Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON). In this role, Fusaro oversaw the $3 billion Honeywell Performance Materials &amp; Technology business. He has also held executive roles at Avnet (NASD: AVT) and Amkor Technologies (NASD: AMKR). These positions all contribute to Fusaro’s lengthy experience in electronics, semiconductors, and manufacturing. He also has over a decade experience as an engineer (9).

Fusaro purchased 182,772 shares of ARRY in October 2020 at $22 per share for a total cost of $4,020,984 (11). In total, Fusaro owns around 1% of the company (10).

Institutions hold 78% of Array Technologies; the largest holder is Fidelity Investments at 15% of shares. Other holders include AllianceBernstein, Blackrock, the Bank of New York Mellon, and Neuberger Berman Group at over 1% each (12). Array’s stock fell in December 2020 after Oaktree Capital Management sold a significant portion of its position in the company. The selling of these shares is understandable as Oaktree owned a significant percentage of Array through its subsidiary, ATI Intermediate Holdings (13).

#Outlook and Strategy
The outlook for the solar industry is very promising. Solar is the fastest growing form of electricity generation in the United States. Analysts project the solar industry to grow earnings 32% annually over the next five years (17).

Estimations indicate U.S. installations of ground-mounted solar generation capacity will reach a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16%. Array sees several tailwinds for the industry: regulation of fossil fuels, decreasing solar energy costs, growing support for clean energy initiatives, and accelerating deployment of utility-scale batteries (4).

Specific to Array’s market, U.S. installations of trackers for 1+ megawatt systems are growing at a CAGR of 35%. Array’s products are now present on more than 1 in 4 solar modules installed in the U.S. to date (5). Over 50% of utility-scale solar projects use tracking systems in the United States (14). Array Technologies is positioning itself to achieve more of this market share.

Array Technologies is executing a three part growth strategy:

* **Gain market share in the company’s core U.S. business:** Array’s order book increased by 31% year-over-year from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020 (15).

* **Expand internationally:** In the last nine months of 2020 the company increased its international footprint by over 50% (15).

* **Perform bolt-on acquisitions:** As of their Q3 2020 earnings call, Array is currently pursuing several acquisition targets (15).

Array’s existing revenues have protection through the company’s patents on its DuraTrack system and components. The company’s linked-row, rotating gear drive system also has patent protection until 2030. The patent protects their single-axis tracking system that uses just one electric motor to drive the rotation of multiple rows of solar modules using articulated driveline joints. The patent also protects DuraTrack’s wind-mitigation stowing system. The company believes its patents force competitors to use less efficient designs, maintaining Array’s competitive advantage (4).

#Competitors
NEXTracker Inc. is Array’s main competitor and also the largest solar tracking company in the world. NEXTracker is a subsidiary of Flex Ltd. (NASD: FLEX) after its acquisition in 2014. Flex’s stock rose significantly after Array’s IPO, indicating NEXTracker being further priced into Flex’s valuation.

Flex does not report individual financial data for NEXTracker in its filings. This makes it difficult to perform a fundamental comparison between the two. However, analyzing the difference in their products provides valuable insight.

NEXTracker’s solar trackers use one motor per row of solar panels, compared with DuraTrack’s one motor for several rows. NEXTracker’s use of more motors leads to increased cost and is one reason for Array’s superior LCOE, although NEXTracker’s systems are more advanced technically. NEXTracker is unable to switch to a single-motor system because of Array’s patents. IArray Technologies is currently in litigation concerning an ex-employee who allegedly shared trade secrets with NEXTracker in violation of a non-compete agreement (4).

Competitively, Array’s only real moat is its patents which expire in 2030. The company does have certain product advantages over NEXTracker because of DuraTrack’s lower cost, simplicity, LCOE, and wind mitigation system. Array’s patents on these systems will eventually expire. It is also possible that competitors mirror these features without infringing on Array’s patents (4). Investors should be aware of Array’s low/non-existent moat.

#Financials
Array Technologies is working to decrease product costs while drastically increasing revenues and profits. The company is already profitable with positive free cash flow. The table below illustrates Array’s revenues, earnings, and cash flows (18).

Category|TTM|2019|2018
:--|:--|:--|:--
Total Revenue|975,116|647,899|290,783
Gross Profit|248,141|150,761|11,555
Operating Income|171,402|83,409|-61,206
Net Income|121,046|39,745|-60,764
Normalized EBITA|196,502|110,692|-33,203
Operating Cash Flow|141,016|386,073|-11,727
Free Cash Flow|139,488|384,376|-18,157

Array Technologies’ 2019 revenue was $647,899,000, growing 123% over 2018. Array has grown revenues 51% in the trailing 12 months. Margins have increased since 2017, with the exception of a 3% increase due to COVID-19 supply chain disruptions (15). Currently, gross margins are at just over 25% (18).

Array holds $27.14 million in cash and carries very little debt. The company is not at risk of insolvency with a current ratio of 1.8 and Debt/Equity of 0.03. Array is using its low-debt status to pursue bolt-on acquisitions and has the cash pile to do so (19).

ARRY trades at ratios of 51.33 P/E, 5.40 P/S, and 2.09 PEG (18). These valuation metrics are inline or slightly higher than the industry averages of 59.32 P/E, 4.53 P/S, and 1.85 PEG (17). Fundamentally, the valuation appears high but Array’s extreme growth in revenue and earnings makes it seem more reasonable. The company’s valuation is inline with other companies in the solar industry and growing faster.

The mean price target for ARRY is $51.05 which translates to a ~30% upside. The lowest price target is $37 from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS). The highest price target is $60 from Piper Sandler (NYSE: PIPR) (21). 

#Risks
There are many risks to consider before investing in Array Technologies. These risks include but are not limited to:

* Array Technologies is reliant on the success of a single product

* Array does not have a significant (if any) moat

* Array has a high valuation due to its growth, which may stop or slow

* ARRY is an extremely volatile stock

* The company releases its fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings report on March 9th, 2021

* Major shareholders selling could cause the stock to fall

* Low reviews on Glassdoor; employee morale may be low following management changes (22)

* Competitors, like NEXTracker, could take market share from Array

# Rolls Royce Stock Analysis


Rolls Royce is near an all time low, and I wondered if it was a good long term investment. Here is my analysis.

Of course, none of this is financial advise!

Last week I started this topic on Reddit. Based on the sentiment on Reddit, this is what I heard:

1. Do not confuse Rolls Royce with the car company. Auto manufacturing unit is now owned by BMW.

2. Rolls Royce is primarily an aerospace, aviation and defense company.

3. People generally do not expect a short-term recovery in aviation.

4. Others see the all-time-low stock and are willing to throw some money on it.


## Current Scenario


Rolls Royce has been hit by the ""double whammy"" - aviation distress due to Covid-19 + the Brexit drama. Which resulted in the stock price hovering around £1 since late October.

Pre-Covid price was hovering around £7.


## Fundamentals


The company has cash reserves of £9 billion and they expect to burn £2 billion this year. This projection is based on expectation that air-traffic in 2021 will be 55% of 2019.

Here's the revenue breakdown (as per 2019 annual report)

* Civil aerospace    51%
* Power systems      22%
* Defence            21%
* ITP Aero            6%
* Others              1%

Out of these, in 2019, Defence was the most profitable business unit, despite accounting for one fifth of the revenue. Civil aerospace was the least profitable with an operating profit just under £50 million.

Their 2019 backorders were £61 billion, thus appearing to be in firmer financial footing than what the stock price indicates.


## FY20 Estimates and FY21 and FY22 Projections


FY20 Loss       (£1682mil)  *estimate
FY21 Profit       £209mil   *projection
FY22 Profit       £790mil   *projection

While the exact numbers in these estimates and projection might differ, analyst consensus expects a strong Rolls Royce recovery in FY22 starting with a partial recovery in FY21.


## Rolls Royce and the Indian Defense Sector


From recent press releases, two items caught my attention.

First was their partnership with HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) regarding the production and supply chain of Adour Mk 871 and Trent engines. And second was their partnership with Infosys for Aerospace Engineering in India.

Why these reports excite me:

1. One obvious reason is the operational efficiencies to be gained from moving production to India.

2. India is one of the largest defense markets in the world and HAL recently won a contract with the Indian air force for the delivery of fighter jets and trainers.

3. Companies that move manufacturing to India tend to win larger Indian defense contracts, as seen with Dassault Aviation's recent success in this market.

There's another likelihood. India's indiginous aerospace sector has made rapid progress in the last two decades. But one of their achilles heels has been the ability to produce engines and propulsion systems.

Groups like Tata, Infosys, Reliance are eager to capture the Indian defence and aerospace market. With Rolls Royce's proven propulsion system capabilities and their all-time low stock price, one can't rule out enhanced interest in partnerships, mergers and acquisitions.

This won't be the first time an Indian conglomerate has shown interest in British industrial assets.


## Scenario 1: Steady Recovery


The first scenario is in line with analyst projections of profitability in FY21 and FY22. This will see a steady increase of the Rolls Royce stock price to par value at £7-£10 in the next two years.

Just a return to pre-Covid levels yield 5x to 7x returns. Ask yourself how soon would Rolls Royce recover to post-Covid levels.


## Scenario 2: Acquisition


Second scenario is the stock price struggling due to Covid and Brexit in the first half of 2021, which then leads to an increased acquisition interest in Rolls Royce by either American or Indian defense / aerospace companies.

It is hard to predict stock price in this scenario, but it will be magnitudes greater than current price of £1.


## Scenario 3: Status Quo


Covid could get worse. Brexit drama continues. Rolls Royce's civil aerospace business struggles and is potentially sold off.

The stock price witnesses a marginal recovery in this scenario, let's say in the £2.5 range sometime in 2022? Still a 2.5x return in 18 to 24 months.

KillerAc1,0.0,25.0,"Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!

To start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their ""overweight"" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.

The goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.

I'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating

1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)

I believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio

Now we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)

2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)

 Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.

3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)

Now we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative

4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)

That list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.

5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.

They've been buying up the brands everywhere,  they have the distribution, THEY KNOW HOW TO MARKET ADDICTION......all they need is the law changed - then with $1B more investment - Altria-controlled money-maker JUGGERNAUT.

benbben,0.0,26.0,"**Disclosure:** I decided to go long in this name today with 500 shares @$4.09/share. If I can free up more money, I’ll likely buy more shares. I’m not a professional advisor, and this isn’t advice.

**TL;DR** – covid recovery + management + new wins + awesome dividends = a great ROI

**What is $NCMI?** – National CineMedia, Inc. ([https://investor.ncm.com/](https://investor.ncm.com/)) – they are the largest cinema advertising network (e.g. the ads that play before a movie in the theater). They have an exclusive arrangement with 57 leading national theatre circuits, including $AMC, $CNK, and Regal Entertainment (sub of LON:$CINE).

**Ownership Structure**: It’s interesting that $NCMI actually operates its business as a joint venture with $AMC (0.9%), $CNK (25.1%), and Regal (26%), with $NCMI owning the remaining (48%). This means that the theaters have a vested interest in the advertising wing being successful (refer to page 25 of the December 1, 2020 Investor Presentation).

A few other reasons why I believe that $NCMI is undervalued:

· **COVID Recovery:** I believe in the thesis that as the country receives the COVID vaccine throughout this year, consumers will want to return to movie theaters – this business is primarily dependent upon a return to theaters, and we’ve seen support for that thesis – e.g. $AMC successfully refinancing their debt in order to preserve cash flow this year. This assumption is key to the recovery of both movie theaters in general, as well as $NCIM

· **Management:** I believe that the leadership team is highly capable and their significant experience in the industry will enable a rebound in short order. The CEO, Thomas Lesinski, has been on the Board since 2014, was made CEO in 2019, and previously worked for Sonar Entertainment ([https://sonarent.com/](https://sonarent.com/)), Paramount, and Warner Brothers. The rest of the team shows a deep bench too

· **Recent new business win not tied to theaters:** This week the company announced that they entered into an agreement with Ziosk to entertain guests at restaurants. If you’re not familiar with Ziosk, hop on over to your local Olive Garden and you’ll see that Ziosk is that thing they put on your table that you unavoidably look at and use to pay your bill. Ziosk has &gt;150k screens on tables at restaurants, and as we see a return to restaurants post-covid, the recovery that $NCMI experiences won’t be limited to just theaters. This is particularly interesting, because as we see the covid recover, we should think about $NCMI’s growth not being capped by theater activity. Even with some theaters closing, their content will still be on more screens because of the deal with Ziosk (see announcement here: [https://investor.ncm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/national-cinemedia-ncm-and-ziosk-team-entertain-restaurant](https://investor.ncm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/national-cinemedia-ncm-and-ziosk-team-entertain-restaurant))

· **Short Interest:** I considered excluding this, because the data around short interest is opaque at best. While the % short interest was not incredibly high, given that this name doesn’t see a high trading volume, it would take a number of days to cover the position. Now, based on the activity that has recently occurred with $AMC, my guess is that the HFs have closed out most of the short positions before it could be squeezed, so this may be a non-factor. Also, any squeeze that could potentially occur would be limited in nature. However, I do believe that the meaningful short interest over the course of 2020 helped drive the value of $NCMI down, just as they did with $AMC – you can see the correlation for the period commencing around March/April 2020.

· **Downside Mitigation:** $NCMI has a history of paying healthy dividends. If you think about it, this makes sense given that it’s &gt;50% owned by theaters, and they view this as a means to capture some of the value from their ads space. Although the dividend was cut recently, as soon as the business starts coming back to movie theaters, we’ll see the dividend pop back up as well. If you’re an investor like me who can stomach not seeing any capital appreciation or dividends for a year or so until we start seeing that recovery, you’re looking at a solid business that can yield a lot of dividends. In 2018 and 2019, the company paid $0.68 in dividends. Assuming that they could get back to that same level of dividends by 2022, at the time I’m writing this (pre-market 2/12/2021), with the share price of $4.12 on 2/11/2021, that would provide a 16.5% dividend yield. Even in 2020, they were able to manage an 8.3% dividend yield. The real question is: how long will it take to ramp business back up to pre-covid levels?

· **Further Analysis:** I haven’t built my financial model just yet, but that will be the next step and I’m hoping to do that next weekend and post an update with more # crunching to prove it out in greater detail.

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.  

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner’s third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon. 

“Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. “In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,” Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality. 

“H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, ""We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020."" Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was “off to a good start,” adding there was “a lot of interest” in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores. 

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI) and SpartanNash (SPTN). 

The question is if this success in grocery is short lived due to the pandemic, or will this continue once it is behind us.

giantsIV,0.0,24.0,"For the last few months I’ve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it’s something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.

 One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by “hugging” the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.


Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let’s take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:

&amp;nbsp;

Here is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)


Here is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)


Here is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)


Also some other big investment things that I can't say on this sub have fallen into the 5-2-3 strategy.

&amp;nbsp;

And finally to another recent stock: GME. Many would argue it was a short squeeze turned Pump and Dump but the reality is that to a certain degree it too fell into the 5-2-3 strategy. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could’ve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.

They make Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The Company focuses on cardiovascular, diabetes care, diagnostics, neuromodulation, nutrition and medicine. Beat earnings in every quarter of 2020. 

**NIKE**: A staple in so many different industries. Pro sports, high school and college sports, sneaker culture, clothing, fitness, etc. They're not going anywhere.

**PAWZ (ProShares Pet Care ETF)**: people love their pets. simple. Up 67% in the past year.

**TMO (Thermo Fisher Scientific)**:  ""Company that dominates the biotech supply chain. Their products will be seen in every single lab all over the world. You want to run a gel, isolate DNA/RNA, proteins, want to buy fluorescent probes, dyes, standards, want to run western blots, run mass spec sample preps, hell - do you want to buy a mass spec instrument? They have got it all. Pays a small dividend too. They are obviously struggling in the sequencing space, which is dominated by illumina. DNA synthesis also seems to be burgeoning in smaller companies such as IDT or trilink. But TMO has a good coverage for all sorts of lab needs."" -u/Nosemyfart

**TGT (Target)**: Eigth largest retailer in the US. Analysts seem to like it more than walmart and costco. tbh you could probably just throw walmart, target, costco, caseys, etc. on a dartboard and buy whichever one you hit.

# About

1. MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). ""DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays"".
2. Magnachip the #1 independent global DDIC manufacturer in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)

* If I use my body as an example, my brain tells my body what to do, but without my spinal cord, I'm useless.
   * Brain = Processor
   * Body = Display
   * DDIC = Spinal Cord

# History

1. **MX is a 20+ year company that was the first in the market to start developing OLED DDIC (2003). Due to being the first in the market, they have had a lot of time to develop and have accumulated quality IP/Patents and processes for OLED DDIC. -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-surpasses-the-500-million-milestone-in-cumulative-shipments-of-display-driver-ics-for-oled-screens-300891577.html)

* What is OLED? OLED is the next generation of screens.  

   * TV went from Tube - LCD - LED
   * Phones are going from LCD - OLED  

      * In all smartphone displays,

1. **The issue was, MX was so early to the game (in 2003) that no one was ready for OLED. Smartphones didn't even exist yet. So while MX kept producing other products such as DDIC for LCD, MX kept preparing and developing their baby, knowing that the secret sauce was in the OLED.**

# So what has changed? 5G!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **As you all know, 5G is going to become the norm within the next 2-3 years.**

* if you have been living under a rock, 5G is the next generation in cellular connectivity, 100x faster which is going to open all sorts of opportunities for the world.

1. When phone manufacturers introduce the new ""latest and greatest"", you can't give a phone with 5G lightning speeds but not upgrade everything else! So manufacturers upgrade other parts of the phone to continuously justify the price point.
2. **Manufacturers need to add things like:**

* Better/slimmer designs
* Faster processors
* New Colors
* But most obviously, better quality screens.
   * Screens have become more important especially with the rise of the mobile gaming industry.
      * Reports estimate that by the end of 2020, mobile game revenue will hit $76.7 billion, more than the film and music industry combined. - [source](https://www.ironsrc.com/blog/top-51-mobile-app-and-gaming-statistics/)
      * We all know you can't be playing Fortnite or watch Youtube while looking at a potato screen.

# Connecting MX and the rise of 5G

1. MX has been waiting 18 years for this day to come.
   1. **MX has recently launched their new DDIC product lines which feature**

* **a 28nm OLED DDIC (down from 40nm) = smaller thinner phone. The DDIC's also feature -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-launches-28-nanometer-oled-ddic-for-smartphone-displays-300831906.html)
   * 120hz High Frame Rate (HFR) = smoother picture, especially for gaming.
   * compatibility with various display types = rigid, flexible, foldable, VR/AR
   * reduction in power voltage from 1.1v to 1.0 = reducing power consumption by more than 20% and extending battery life
   * reduction in Electromagnetic Interference by 20% = clearer phone calls
   * support for Low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) displays = more power efficient backplane = extending battery life

1. **In addition, the 28nm OLED DDIC are going to be made in 300mm fabs (factories) = greater profit margin**

* Chips are made in fabs, usually on 200 or 300mm wafers. - [source](http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ice/cd/CEICM/SECTION7.pdf)
   * 200mm wafers was technology introduced in 1992,
      * This is similar to trying to boil 1 million eggs in a medium sized saucepan.
      * In addition, the saucepan is old and it's possible that the eggs might get cracked = lower yield/lower margins.
   * 300mm wafers are the new standard in making chips
      * making 1 million eggs in a shiny large pot (which has a lower chance of eggs getting cracked) = higher yield/ higher margin

# One last thing... (if you get this innuendo, good job):

1. A korean tech blog reported that the new iPhone 13 displays will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. It is said that they want
   1. OLED Screen
   2. 120hz HFR
   3. LPTO Displays
2. Hmm.. I wonder if Samsung has a relationship with a DDIC company that has the chips that provides/support all that? - [source](http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128)

# Valuation

(**Just today (as-is), MX should be 2x the stock price (today's price $19). -** [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MX/)

* 2020 MX Revenue was: $465,519,000 (not including sale of 200mm fab)
* 2020 MX profit was: $128,317,000
* In addition, they have $279 million dollars sitting in the bank, partially due to the sale of the 200mm fab
* (If we take out the sale of the 200mm fab) 2020 MX P/E ratio should be around: 12\~15= 13.5
* If we look at comparable companies (P/E Ratio):  

   * $SYNA: 33.34 - 4.72 billion valuation
   * $HIMX: 27.72- 2.59 billion valuation
   * Semiconductor Standard: 23.01
* If we take the Industry Standard PE Ratio of 23.01, the stock price of $MX should be **(AT MINIMUM)** around $35\~38.2 or around 2x current stock price. 1- 1.4 billion dollars

(For the future) **In 1/2021, MX gave an Investor Presentation where they projected that by 2023, the Global OLED DDIC Market for JUST phones would be $2.3 billion dollars. If MX JUST maintains their current market share: -** [source](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/1f35be54-5c8f-419c-b8bc-f4e277264ee6)

* 2023 revenue would be $805 million dollars.
* 2023 expected gross margin (thanks to their 300mm fabs) would be 30%.
* 2023 profit would be $241.5 million dollars.
* Using the same P/E ratio valuation, market cap would be at 6.8 billion, stock price of $201.58, or 1018.60% gains.

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? 

- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? 

- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.


## Investing in Internet Forums

In my view, Pinterest can be one of the most sound social-networking investments.  Let’s keep one question in mind:

&gt; Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution.

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

- Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
- Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
- Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
- Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
- Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways. I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.


## Searching 

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally. 

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times: 

Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)
Skincare ideas (Target)
Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)
Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie, etc)

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. 
Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design. 

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy _outside_ of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.


## The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security &amp; Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify or Wordpress.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. Vectors for user’s channels like Etsy, Zoom, or TikTok.
6. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.



## Summary

I believe Pinterest qualifies as an excellent investment. I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.


I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.

Help me identify which companies could go FAANG next? Not looking for get rich quick, rather I’m looking for companies who are changing the world. Companies that could grow 10x over the next 10 years. Before diving into the financial DD, here are the criteria I’m considering.

1. On the leading edge of a revolution.
2. Run by great, forward thinking leaders.
3. Continue to pivot and add new features to fuel growth.
4. Market Cap under or around $100B.

Here are three companies that make my short list. These companies all started with a relatively small idea but then continued to pivot into a revolutionary idea.

1. ROKU – Leader in the **Cord Cutting Revolution**. Started as a simple hardware company, then developed software integrated into smart TVs and now takes a cut of all advertising on their platform. Mkt Cap = $60B
2. SHOP – Leader in the **Online Retail Revolution.** Started as a simple e-commerce platform for small business, then built a fulfillment network and now integrating with major players such as Walmart and Facebook Marketplace. Mkt Cap = $175B
3. SQ – Leader in **Payment Processing Revolution.** Started as a simple mobile credit card reader, then to full point of sale system and now leading the way in peer-to-peer transactions with the CashApp. Mkt Cap = $123B

It’s revenues will be a tad shy of $500m in 2021 with 83% of sales to government and 17% private sector.  They are doing the dreaded/exciting transition to a SaaS model which can often come with bumps and bruises but result in a much higher valuation on price to sales as it becomes more and more recurring revenues.  Right now they are 50% recurring revenues software subscriptions.  Their products are either sold as appliances with software loaded or as a subscription where the customer uses their own internal equipment.  Either way this is an on-premise transaction, not installable over the cloud.  In a sense, this probably remains on-prem long term as the information being analyzed is the guts and heart of the data at an organization and requires more sensitivity care taking.  The company has $100m plus revenue in their professional services organization which looks like a break even proposition required to install Cognyte’s products at the customer.  

Ok, the good news they are profitable!  They will likely earn around $80m in EBITDA in 2021 and the management has laid out a goal of 80c EPS in FY22.  The software subscription business is growing around 10% during the pandemic which is likely depressed due to the difficulties installing on-premise type software at the moment.  The perpetual one time software sales (50% of total) are declining slightly during this transition to recurring revenues. The company sports an enterprise value of $1.8 billion with total software revenues of over $400m annually split 50/50 perpetual and recurring.

Its not expensive at 4-5x price to sales for a company transitioning to a SaaS model.  Lets be optimistic here and say a focused stand alone company can now grow their non-government business to a more balanced 50/50 ratio over time.  And post pandemic, it will be much easier to do on prem installs helping the company grow faster overall.  At the same time, transitions can be tricky and we do not have enough history to know if this management is up to the task.  What we know is their products are mission critical.   

In summary, we like this stock and think the risks of transition issues are largely priced in at the low p/s ratio.  Given its recent spin out, we would take a ½ position and get comfortable with managements growth goals of double digit top line and mid teens bottom line the next few years.  A reasonable target would be this company is able to growth fast enough that investors re-rate the stock to 7-10x sales in the next 12-24 months.  Having said that, again ½ position and see if we can own this at $25-28, not chase this name.  Also be cognizant of unlocks in the shareholder base that might create volatility such as Apax Partners which owns 3.7m shares.",stocks,CGNT is the next PLTR yet was recently spun-out and listed,23.0,0.79

# Strategy
&gt;...That was the unseen message. I mean, nobody ever said it that way. So, I have seen half of the United States’ talent basically put off to the side. - Warren Buffet

I find that the most valuable investing tool is to pay attention to the obvious and to keep investments simple to understand. I expect a few things to happen throughout the years as I invest, and I try to be sensible about those changes. Time is on my side.

- Industrial processes will improve greatly by way of automation technology.
- Research into materials improve, in order to solve significant challenges related to global climate &amp; health.
- US women and minorities education rates will cause dramatic changes in economic opportunity.
- Financial regulations will lower to adjust for the level of trust that cybersecurity applications bring to its system.
- Trade between the US &amp; Mexico will increase.
- Cloud computing will serve as a bridge for many economic frontiers.

As the saying goes, invest in what you know. So let’s get on with it, technology and industrials.

My strategy is to build an engine that I can debate about and get behind the wheel on. It can change over time, but it’s the critical thought process that matters at the end. It’s an engine that I want to trust to run through the good times and bad so that I am not nearly as concerned with current financial statuses at certain periods of time.
 
## Cash (15-30%)

The most critical element to my portfolio is a constant rate of cash per month. This is a “joker card”, if you will, where eventually the growing cash pile will eventually be invested when the opportunity is right and resets to 0. This holding is reserved for highly desired investment opportunities like:

- Impossible Foods
- MOD Pizza
- Reddit
- RH (don’t hurt me)

It is a pile of cash that searches for a wonderful company at a fair price. 

## Industrial (20-35%)

This element to my portfolio helps me sleep at night. The goal here is to try to capture important elements to a healthier North American industrial sector. The name of the game is **quality** and to capture broader markets. 

At the speculative level, the economic consequences of industrial automation should start to gain more impact. One could argue that the value of precision measurement will increase as machines handle more material, for example.

1. AMD - _Computing_
2. Mettler-Toledo - _Precision Scales &amp; Analytic Instruments_
3. Ecolab - _Sanitation, water, energy, and air management_
4. Kansas City Southern - _Mexican-American Trade_
5. Rockwell Automation - _Industrial controls_

  
## Cloud Compute (45-60%)

These are my general bets on technology. I found it enormously challenging to go through the exercise of selecting a stock between industry leaders like Square &amp; PayPal or Alphabet &amp; Apple.

I’ve included where these companies are consequential, and why they will sustain growth as a result.

1. Pinterest - _Discovery Engine (Women driven markets)_
2. Square - _Financial Access (Underbanking solutions)_
3. Alphabet - _Internet (Distribution of education technology)_
4. Fastly - _Networking (Serverless compute)_

  
## ETFS and Watchlist (10-20%)

These holdings are held in order to track certain industry “bets” like robotics, electric grids, cyber security, gaming, semiconductors and the like. The point is to diversify almost excessively here and to observe changes over time.

0toHeroInvesting,0.0,22.0,"**Do you like to invest in growth stocks? Are you also interested in subscription-based companies? Then today we are going to talk about one of 2020’s investor favorite, Peloton!**

**\~Very Long Post - Don't Read If You Hate Long DDs\~**

We are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF while we will also do a little technical analysis and get some price targets for the workout at home favorite for this year and for 2025 as I will give my opinion if Peloton still has room to grow or if this is was a one-year unicorn!

**\[Full Disclosure - I have no positions in Peloton, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next days\]**

So, what is Peloton and what do they do? They are a [company](https://imgur.com/5X1tZbO) that offers hardware fitness products like their Bike or Tread, but compared to your other traditional companies, they also offer subscriptions which allow you to watch live streams or on-demand classes that will help you with your home workouts.

You can also get these streaming products through their own Peloton app, which costs $13/month without any of their hardware devices, as Peloton mostly offers premium products that are targeting high end consumers, with their Tread starting from $2500 and up to $4300, while their Bikes are priced in the $1900 to $2500 price range.

They became a very popular stock in the past year as they saw a huge boost in their revenues &amp; earnings in 2020, as more &amp; more people switched to home workouts, though it will be very interesting to see if this trend can continue after things start going back to normal.

**So, guys, let’s go through the 2th quarter results for Peloton, as they use a different financial year, starting in the middle of the year!**

Peloton released the latest earnings [report](https://imgur.com/e2XJgEf) at the start of February in which they beat both the top line by $30M and the bottom line, as the company posted an $0.18/share profit

The revenue generated in the last quarter and the number of connected subscriptions [grew](https://imgur.com/rvUjDdj) by over 120% year/year, which was hugely boosted by the events we saw in 2020.

Peloton has 2 main streams of revenues, the connected fitness products and the subscriptions revenues.

You can see [here](https://imgur.com/PEzBMmW) the company made just over $1B in total revenues in the last quarter, which was an increase of 29% over the last quarter, continuing the uptrend started in 2020.

Peloton saw an increase of 45% in revenues from connected fitness products, even though they are still facing big delays in delivering their products to customers, with both bikes and treads seeing delivery time of over 6 weeks even now.

I believe this revenue stream growth will likely peak this year, which I expect to be the last one where workouts at home are the nr.1 way to stay in shape.

Meanwhile, their other revenue stream, the subscriptions revenue, has increased over 240% over the same period in 2019, and has increased 23% over the previous quarter.

On the other hand, their cost of sales for both the hardware products as well as the subscription services has pretty much stayed the same, hovering over 60% for the [hardware](https://imgur.com/WklsExN) equipment and around 40% for the [subscription](https://imgur.com/yAcVAoU) services.

I don’t see how they will drastically improve this, so I will just slightly increase their margins by 1%/year for both revenue streams.

The other operating expenses are also pretty significant for the company, as they use [over](https://imgur.com/zi7scZV) 13% of their revenues for General &amp; Administrative purposes.

Peloton also [invests](https://imgur.com/65pEtEh) 4.5% of their revenues back into R&amp;D to continue to stay ahead of the competition, while the biggest chunk of the [OpEx](https://imgur.com/mwu5emz) goes to sales &amp; marketing which accounts for over 16% of their total revenues.

The company does have decent [financials](https://imgur.com/jVHpMgw) with over $2B cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities which can easily pay off the current and long-term liabilities of the company which stand at just under $2B.

Peloton has increased their capital [expenditures](https://imgur.com/ouNgPm2) in the past year, spending $120M in the last 6 months of 2020 compared to under $50M for the same period in 2019, and this will continue to increase, as they have a pending transaction to acquire [Precor](https://imgur.com/8ayKVp7) for over $400M in cash.

The company has continued to [increase](https://imgur.com/givDlZe) the depreciation &amp; amortization expenses, which will have a positive impact on their EBITDA, while on the other hand, they have pretty insignificant other incomes &amp; expenses on their bottom line, with just $1.8M [added](https://imgur.com/z4o8zeS) to the bottom line in the last quarter of 2020.

Not all companies do, but Peloton gives pretty detailed data which allows us to easily calculate the net working capital of the company for the DCF numbers, though you should always dig deep through the financials as Pelton has once major problem, which is the share dilution of the company.

We can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/r0nBAZf) , the company has almost 300M shares outstanding, but the bigger problem is that they have massively increased the number of shares available, up from 160M in 2019 and are planning to continue to dilute their stock as they are giving out a big number of stock options for their employees, with over 50M [shares](https://imgur.com/B4k2PEg) just in the last 3 months of 2020

This stock compensation plan is [based](https://imgur.com/qyknNRm) on their 2019 equity incentive plan, which continued after their 2015 plan. In this plan the company allows up to 5% of the total outstanding shares to be granted until 2029, which will continue to add pressure to the price of the stock

The other risk factors that the company [mentioned](https://imgur.com/rAEGr22) are the increasingly competitive market they operate in, a possible decline in their Bike &amp; Tread sales and of course the supply chain issues, which have affected the company for the past year.

The company itself points out the fact that they just become profitable in the past 2 quarters after losing money in each year since their inception, but [provided](https://imgur.com/xn34i2P) an upbeat guidance for Q3, as they expect to continue to add additional sales regions for their products in 2021, while also closing the deal with Precor, which will help them in their manufacturing process

So, folks, taking into account the financials of the company, their outlook and my own projections for the growth of company I made some predictions, but please remember, this is not investment advice &amp; do your own Due Diligence before investing!

**Let’s start with the discounted free cash flow projections to see what the current valuation of the company is.**

I [started](https://imgur.com/TxLlTmH) from their current earnings before interest &amp; tax which stand at 7% of their revenues currently. I implied a 2% annual growth for this, as the company will become more profitable as they scale up their business.

The company has a very short history for their effective tax rate, which was way below the 21% US tax rate, but given that most tech companies manage to get substantially better effective tax rates, I think a 15% for Peloton is realistic.

I also added back their D&amp;A for which I implied the same growth rate as the one for their revenues, but we will discuss the revenue growth in a couple of minutes.

Peloton will need to continue to invest in Capex to be able to scale up their business, while their net working capital is expected to decline as they will slowly start to build up inventories after the huge supply crisis that they faced starting in 2020.

So, folks, for an 9.5% discount rate, which is what I will use for the moment, we get just over $3.6B in discounted free cash flows by 2026. This rate is a combination of the average sp500 return and the current yield of the 10year Treasury bill which stands around 1.5%.

As always, there are 2 methods of doing the valuation from here, the EBITDA multiple valuation, for which we get a $152.5 price target and the Perpetuity Approach for which we get a $100 price target.

You might be wondering why I used a 19x EBITDA approach for Peloton, well I chose an average between the 25x multiple for Technology and 14x multiple for the fitness industry.

Folks, I wouldn’t pick one or the other valuation, so I like to use an average approach, which would result in a PRICE target of $126.58 or a 17% upside for the stock in the next 12 months

**Given all of this, I think now is the time to move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Peloton.**

I believe we can [continue](https://imgur.com/UOVmn6U) to see a significant growth for their sales of fitness products in the next years, but this growth will slow down in the future, as we slowly get over this stay-at-home environment, even if we never fully go back to the way things were.

I believe the bigger growth stream will come from their subscription service, as they continue to improve the products they offer, including their Peloton App which doesn’t even require you to own their hardware.

For the cost of sales, as I said previously, I only implied a 1% annual improvement of their margins on both revenue streams as I also maintained their average from the previous 2 years regarding the other operating expenses like SG&amp;A and R&amp;D.

Given these numbers &amp; projections, we get a gross profit for Peloton of just over $2B by 2025. But there are many other things that we have to take into [account](https://imgur.com/nYJMaS3) like the Capex spending, which I believe will continue to see an increase of at least 5%/year and the interest &amp; other income &amp; expenses, which for Peloton are pretty insignificant.

So, the bottom line I think we will see for Peloton in 2025, including an estimated 15% effective tax rate is just under $1.7B.

The last important thing to take into account when doing long-term valuations is how the number of outstanding shares will continue to evolve, and in this case, I believe we will continue to see at least a 5% dilution for Peloton stock in the next years, which would mean by 2025 we would see almost 356M shares.

**So, after all these estimates what are my price targets for the company in the long-run?**

I always like to value companies on future P/E multiples, so, with a $4.69 EPS and depending on what P/E multiple you chose between 25 and 40, we can see the stock can trade in a [range](https://imgur.com/Yd3vi0V) between $117 and $187.

We should also always take a look at what other analysts estimate for the stock, and we can see, there is not much coverage on the stock, but the other analyst predicted an even [lower](https://imgur.com/Ve9kxA1) EPS by 2025.

Folks, my final price targets for Peloton by 2025 range between $129 for the Bear case, $152 for the base case and almost $176 for the bull case, implying gains between 19% and up to 63% on the stock, which I believe are not that interesting, as you can usually get similar returns by just investing in index funds, ETFs ore other stocks with much lower risk factors.

So yeah guys, these are my [OVERALL](https://imgur.com/qSjBldl) price targets for the next 12 months and for 2025

**But now, you are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Peloton?**

Let’s start by looking at this [CHART](https://imgur.com/8aPs73V). We can see Peloton was trading on huge volumes towards the end of last year with 30-40M shares/day on multiple occasions, which we saw again once the Precor news popped up.

Since that moment, the stock seems to have fallen out of favor, as the volume has consistently stayed below 10M shares/day. The stock is pretty oversold right now after the recent sell-off caused by the spike in treasury yields, but has a decent support line near the $108 levels, though I believe it will face major resistance to break $138 again given the fact that no major catalysts are expected soon, as most of the earnings and revenue growth is already priced in the stock price.

Folks, I always check what other wall street [analysts](https://imgur.com/oDfBRNB) think of the stock, and it seems in this case they are massively overvaluing the company in my opinion with 23 bullish ratings and just 2 bearish views, with an average price target of $165.

**So, are you asking yourself, what would I do?**

Well, I would mostly stay away from this stock, as I believe there are far better opportunities out there in the stock market, but if you like you can nibble a little and buy some Peloton after this big sell-off, as the stock is down a lot from its all-time highs.

Yeah guys, [these](https://imgur.com/ROoZH4p) are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Peloton will struggle to enter households with more than 1 of their products, as you can [see](https://imgur.com/OaXePee), only 3% of their customers use both a bike and a tread, which given the huge price tags of their products is understandable.

I also believe the big % of people that are paying month to month their Peloton subscriptions is another reason for concern, as people are much more likely to ditch those once normal gyms become more attractive once again, and as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/OANrA3R), the trend was not working that much in their favor before 2020, with modest increases in fitness subscriptions &amp; quarterly workouts, while their total revenue and average monthly workouts were even going the wrong way.

And finally, after comparing my projections to Peloton’s own [guidance](https://imgur.com/8vy0xjj), which is way lower than my predictions, it’s obvious the company itself doesn’t expect this insane growth to continue, and even if they do continue to expand in multiple countries, not many countries outside the US will really enjoy their products which are very expensive for most of the countries in the world.

However, bond yields only go up when prices go down, correct? And prices go down when people are selling bonds faster than they are buying them. It seems to me that the only reason for a selloff would be optimism in the future economy and rising inflation expectations.

But if people are optimistic and selling bonds, why are equity prices decreasing? Surely the same people who sold the bonds and are optimistic would put money into equity markets, leading to higher prices? I understand that higher bond yields lead other investors to think about moving capital there, but how can bond yields go up and stock prices go down at the same time?

**Let's really get into the basics first:**

1. Enterprise value = Value of all cash-generating assets of company = Value owned by debt holders + value owned by equity holders
2. Bankruptcy = not enough cash generated by assets to pay off interest on debt. Because debt holders are higher in the cap structure and get paid first, if there's not enough money to pay them it implies there's not enough money to pay equity holders either, and equity values fall dramatically.
3. Share price = Value owned by equity holders / # of shares outstanding

**Why this all matters?**

Short-selling doesn't cause bankruptcy, a lack of cash to pay off interest from debt does. It's really that simple. Companies are heavily shorted because they're on the verge of bankruptcy, not because short-selling causes bankruptcy. Basic causation and correlation mix-up.

Short-selling, even illegal short-selling, can only cause temporary depressions in price. The total equity valuation per above, does not change. Share price might temporarily be impacted, due to artificial inflation of shares being sold/outstanding. However,  three simple mechanisms completely destroy these short positions over any reasonable amount of time.

1. Value investors notice excellent P/E multiples due to the artificially depressed price, and shark eats shark.
2. Intentionally issuing dividends completely screw the position over, and increase equity value by turning naked short-sellers into cash-generating assets. All short-sellers are responsible for covering these dividends out of their own pockets.
3. Shorting is expensive and requires a trending decline, whereas dilution is a one-time impact. Naked shorts have to manage their opportunity cost, call option purchases, share borrowing costs, and dividend payments. If the share price even stays constant, they eventually bleed until the position has to be closed.

tl;dr Illegal short-selling probably does happen and it's a bad thing. But it's mostly deployed by momentum traders looking to scalp a few dollars off weak hands. The rhetoric used in that thread is asinine, and the author has a poor understanding of how both sides of the trade works. Any CEO that blames short-selling for bankruptcy is a moron and runs a shitty company.",stocks,PSA: Short-selling (naked or not) does NOT cause bankruptcy or even permanent depressions in price,26.0,0.66

Vander_chill,0.0,21.0,"I'm relatively new to Reddit but am loving all the information and camaraderie amongst the members.  In the spirit on helping those who seek advice and not trying to take from anyone.  I just read a post by Civgarth that seemed heartfelt and an honest effort to shed some light on his methods.  Seems he has a good thing going.  Not trying to steal anyone's thunder but just felt compelled to comment and add my own experiences.  Hopefully someone walks away with a little advice on trading.

I learned early on everything in life including trading is about having **realistic expectations** combined with **Win Goals** and **Loss Limits.**  Let the winners ride, and limit your downside and over time you will not lose money unless you simply suck at whatever you do.  Set attainable goals, and in the case of trading price targets, realistic ones.

I will admit, I was fortunate to trade professionally with other peoples money (not for a hedge fund) for a while and learned that the greatest psychologically hump, is what I call, ""the lookback.""  If you sell at the loss limit set, and then the stock goes up, you can't kick yourself.  Likewise if you sell after a nice gain and it keeps going, you cant kick yourself either, you must stick to your decisions...move on to the next one.  Most people can't get over this.

We've all heard someone say with Tesla, or Amazon, or Bitcoin,... ""if only I didn't sell when it was $xxx"".  This is the same concept but much shorter term, so its a much harder pill to swallow.  Also, its good to not just take profits at a predetermined price, but sometimes set a realistic goal and sell a small portion.  The psychological boost and dopamine effect keeps you going and prevents you form making bad decisions.  Greed somehow forces one to make bad decisions.  I've done so many times as well. and still do, can't help myself.

For example, expecting a ""5 bagger"" and going all-in is not realistic.  But say you buy something and it starts moving in your direction, hits your 1st Win Goal, if there is a better investment pending and I need the capital, I will get out no questions asked and move on.  If not I'll take 1/3 or 1/2 off the table and put a Stop Limit just below that way I'm guaranteed something positive.  If it keeps going, who knows, it could become a 5-bagger, I'll just let it ride for a while.  But if I did not sell that initial portion then you get hyper focused, you have a nice gain, looking for more, that rush, that feeling, oooh its nice.  But then sometimes you watch it all go against you.  Been there, will never do that again.

Same with casino's... I never walk into one without knowing how much I have to bet, how much I'm willing to be down or when to stop.  I hate casino's, but my wife likes the slots.  Most people walk in thinking ""I""m only willing to lose this much"".  They are already programmed to lose.  I'm seeing the same thing in some trading subs.

I just did this with AMC.  Bought in Monday at exactly $6.02, told myself I'm out if it gets to $5.50 which seemed to be where it likes to hang, so I put a Stop-Limit there.  Since I was playing a catalyst that something was going to happen I gave it a generous first target of $7 or I'm out at week end.  Next day got lucky, missed the open, and sold 1/2 at $7.  When it got to $10 I got greedy, since it was fueled by GME, I thought it could go higher, contemplated selling it but simply could not.  Instead I chose to see it play out one more day, and moved my stop to $7.5 just in case.  Anyway, sold today at $8.25. I'm very happy.  But had I not sold 50% at $7... it would have totally clouded my judgement.  Nothing wrong with taking a profit. Never ever!!

Not wanting to toot my horn, or be a dick.  Just hope this legitimately helps someone.

Full disclosure:  I do not day-trade for a living but I do trade because I think its in my blood and like the ""managed gambling"" aspect as I like to call it.

felixfarraday,0.0,23.0,"So, I have been researching how stocks and options work for the last year or so, then got pulled into the GME frenzy (got lucky and secured a small profit) and am wanting to learn more.

I have been watching various videos on how ~~gambling~~ options work, yet can't find an answer to the question: Who buys soon to expire options? 

Everything I read says that 99%, you shouldn't exercise you options. But then, who does?

Say I have an option ITM, it has a day to expire, so there is little to no extrinsic value. The stock is at 6, my strike is at 5, so I could profit $100 if executed. Therefore, the value of the of the option would be \~$100. But, I don't want to execute because I don't have $500 to cover the exercise the options, so I choose to sell it.

Well, when I sell it, who the hell is buying that option at $100?  If it is bought at $100 and then exercised, then the profit essentially becomes $0. Do the MM buy it back and get those few cents of profit (that I am assuming exist) between the option value/power and sell price?  That's an awful lot of capital needed for such a small gain...

Also, no one is obligated to buy soon-to-expire calls, so, even if I have very profitable calls that are about to expire, and no one buys them, am I just shit out of luck?

Yes, I am aware of Tesla and a ton of other EV companies with huge rockets behind their stock price. I have had positions in those companies.

Some people make it sound like they are sitting on their hands watching their market share disappear. Moreover, investors are investing like it will be a winner takes all market. That’s not gonna happen.

If any of you remember Steve Ballmer and pre-Nadella times at MSFT. Cloud and SaaS was the name of the game, and MSFT was lagging heavily. All the cool kids on the block looked down on MSFT with comments like: “They have too much legacy, they can’t turn the ship around”. Well, they did. From 30 ish stock price to 240 today.

I had another prediction in r/stocks a little over a week ago that a market correction was still to continue.

I’m hardly the only person that had identified these possibilities, but I do want to continue updating yall with my plan going forward.

Prediction through year end:
The selling from this correction is likely over now. May get a couple of dry heaves next week but the heavy selling (-3+% in a given day is likely done). I am waiting to see at least two days of stability in the next week or two. For example, a Green Day like Friday is not stable. Yes it was up which is good, but far from showing footing.

I believe that as the market digests this quick uptick in yields we will settle in and stocks will grind higher towards retesting highs in some names. Many of the momentum names that had eye popping speculative valuations likely won’t be back to highs this year as folks are spooked.

Highs on solid names will be retested by mid May / early June timing as optimism around economy heating up (double edged sword here) and vaccine rollout continues to build. As things reopen I believe the economy is going to run way too hot and inflation will pick up more than expected. I don’t think the fed will have to do anything drastic but the realization that the economy is overheating will cause additional pressure on certain equity valuations yet again. To me, if we retest highs in May I think there is substantially more risk to the downside (10-15% correction again) than to the upside (4-5%)

Once we get within 1-2% of highs in May I will be building back to roughly 1/3-1/5 cash in my trading portfolio.

This confirmed the skepticism I have always had with stock market. In the 90s too, small long term investors like me gained very little over the decade, as whatever rises the share prices had made, were usually wiped out by one crisis after another.

In fact, I, myself have seen only a gain of less than 15% in last 16 months. Since I entered the market first time in December 2019, the market has seen a deep crash, which I was totally unprepared for and then whatever recovery and gain I made has all been almost wiped out in the past couple of weeks.

Btwn3n20charachters,0.0,23.0,"So I stumbled upon TRMB as one typically does: analyzing Cathie Wood's holdings in ARKQ. I had never heard of the company nor seen the stock mentioned anywhere, but, given TRMB is the #4 holding in ARKQ, I decided to check them out. 

First of all, who the hell even are these people: 

Trimble Inc. is basically a hardware and software provider, focusing on managment and organization systems. 

That may be jibberish to you, but basically the company is broken into 4 segments:

1. Buildings and Infrastructure, which focuses on serving architects, contractors, owners, and operators by providing software for route selection and design; systems to guide and control construction equipment; systems to monitor, track, and manage assets, equipment, and workers; software to share and communicate data; 3D conceptual design and modeling software; building information modeling software; integrated site layout and measurement systems; cost estimating, scheduling, and project controls solutions; applications for sub-contractors and trades; and an integrated workplace management software.
2. Geospatial, which provides surveying and geospatial products, and geographic information systems 
3. Resources and Utilities, which offers precision agriculture products and services, such as guidance and positioning systems, automated and variable-rate application and technology systems, and information management solutions. It offers manual and automated navigation guidance for tractors and other farm equipment; solutions to automate the application of pesticide and seeding; water solutions; Farmer Core, a software subscription that enables farmers to connect their farm operation; and forestry solutions for forest management and timber processing
4. The transportation segment offers solutions for long haul trucking, field service management, rail, and construction logistics industries; and transportation management, analytics, routing, mapping, reporting, and predictive modeling solution

Pretty cool and important stuff, I think, so I dove into the numbers:

18.4 billion dollar market cap (very comparable with industry peers ZBRA, KEYS, CGNX), PE ratio of 30.1 (compared to the industry average of 26.3), avg volume of 2.05 million, all pretty solid. 

Over the past 52 weeks, the stock is up 71.35%, with a 52-week range of 20.01-76.50. The 50-day MA is 70.90. 

Of course, I had to look into the company's financials as well. 

In Q4 2020, the company had a total revenue of 829.70 million dollars (up 0.4% year over year), with an operating income of 127.80 million. The company has an operating margin of around 15%, which is above its industry average. Revenue declined from 2019 to 2020 by 200 million dollars, but that is to be expected given the overall decline of the economy last year. Net income grew dramatically from 2018 to 2019, growing from 315.8 million to 547.4 million, and then grew another 16% (87 million) in 2020. 

Robert Painter, the CEO, ended their most recent earnings call by saying, ""We enter 2021 with increased conviction in our ability to fulfill our mission to transform the way the world works. Furthermore, I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Trimble's inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 as of January 21, a milestone for Trimble's growth and global impact""

The company has continuously beat consensus estimates in earnings per share, most recently beating an expected 0.51 EPS with 0.61 EPS. Q1 2021 EPS consensus is 0.54. 

**Finally, my bull case for the stock:**

* TRMB is an industry leader in agricultural, construction, and trucking telematics.
* Caterpillar, Hyundai, Paccarr, and more are all using TRMB as their telematics solution on many product lines.
* TRMB executives believe telematics have only reached about 25-30% of the total addressable market. 

**Bear case:**

* The company is known to rapidly acquire other companies, where they risk overpaying.

mushyapple,0.0,23.0,"I would like to share with you all what I think about **$LUMN** and why it may and may not be a bet of long-term value in the future. Please feel free to comment anything I may have missed / or falsely claimed. TLDRs will be at the very bottom with my positions.

I will structure this DD by first talking about what Lumen Technologies does and how this is different to what CenturyLink did. (CenturyLink got rebranded to Lumen) I will then include the financials of the company and discuss their most recent quarterly results, finally topping everything off by making an honest list of the potential downside to this investment.

**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor, please do your own research before investing.

**Lumen Technologies** manages one of the world's largest fibre infrastructure that connects the world and powers networks, edge computing, security and collaborative services.

**Adaptive Networking:**

Adaptive Networking is a set of technologies that provide increased network performance, flexibility and security. It is a large and fast growing market valued at $25.8bn in 2019 and expected to grow to $41.8bn by 2024.

To grasp this area, think about a firm, new or old, that wants to increase its virtual connectivity in a post-covid world. This company wants to allow its employees all around US and the world to communicate seamlessly with each other. They want to be able to increase their usage of cloud-based services such as remote working, data storage and easy transmission of operational details among others. They can either set this up by themselves by approaching a plethora of service providers such as lets say, zoom for video calling, aws for cloud stroage etc. Or they could go through Lumen who will provide cloud connectivity, internet and networking, content delivery and will also manage IT services securely so this company doesn't have to.

Why can Lumen do this better than Zoom / Amazon / Google?

\- They operate one of the biggest networks of fibre with over 400,000 miles of networking lines and over 100,000 processing centres, you do not have to go through a third party when you can deal with Lumen directly.

**Collaborative Services:**

They drive productivity, innovation and engagement with reliable and easy-to-use voice, video and contact centre solutions that keep your team in sync and customers connected, regardless of location or device.

What this means is that essentially if you are betting on virtual working to persist, then betting on Lumen will mean betting on them providing faster global connectivity with security. They will be able to provide data-driven analytics of employees productivity and other key metrics. Why choose lumen then you may ask? They have leveraged their technology to do this better than their competitiors:

[https://www.lumen.com/en-hk/resources/infographic/adaptive-networking.html](https://www.lumen.com/en-hk/resources/infographic/adaptive-networking.html)

They average 20% extra operational cost savings, 30% increased application performance, 32% faster configuration changes, and 25% improved security posture.

**Security:**

They base their security on leveraging AI in machine-learnt threat detection. In my honest opinion, I see every company saying they focus majorly on security and protection of customer’s data, which is true but as outsiders we have no way of validating how true it is. The main question to ask is whether LUMN security services are as good as market standard. To which I say: LUMN is the only company to win the Frost &amp; Sullivan's prestigious 2021 Global New Product Innovation Award for its Holistic Web Protection Solutions. You can read more about this on the link below but the fact that lumen is being recognized and not just stating that their security is good, is a great step in the right direction for their turnaround. At the end of the day, the need for privacy and security will only increase down the line, and a company that is able to tackle such threats is in my opinion well positioned to sustainable growth in the future without having to undergo a completely security update in later years.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-only-company-win-130500720.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-only-company-win-130500720.html)

**Why trust Lumen when you hated CenturyLink?**

The company launched a plan in 2019 to reduce operating costs by $800 million to $1 billion by the end of 2021, and in 2020 alone, Lumen reported savings of $830 million, indicating that its efficiency has significantly improved. They are really trying to rebrand themselves and change their entire operational structure. There will always be doubts on this transformation but if they consistently demolish targets like the one mentioned above, one has to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are at least trying. And of course the completely change in the way they are approaching the future of cloud computing and setting up to be one of the leaders to bring 5G to around the world with their massive fibre network.

**Financials:**

1. The market is pricing in a significant decline in corporate earnings for Lumen, and this has created an anomaly that could be exploited by value investors. The stock is trading at a forward earnings multiple of just 7.85, compared to the sector average of 22.27, suggesting the market is very bearish on the company’s prospects

2. Solid Dividend of around $1 (around 9% yield) annually. This has been reduced from the past years in a bid to save free cash flow to reinvest in strategic involvements.

3. They are still perfecting their technology and this may be a negative point for many value investors given declining revenues. Quoting their conference call 2020 Q4: ""Moving to revenue. For the full year 2020, total revenue declined 3.5% to $20.712 billion."" However, the pace at which revenue is declining is declining itself;, this is a 150 basis point improvement from the 5% year-over-year decline in total revenue from 2018 to 2019. Their revenue is not exploding like other growth stocks but it is heading in the right direction.

4. They have massive transformation costs and this will continue to persist in 2021 too. These amass to around $224 million.

5. I am posting their balance sheet and income statement from the latest quarter and year below with some of my comments. To be honest, they do not have the best financials, but they have been paying off their long term debt this year and have leveraged the lowest Interest Rates to take on marginally cheaper debt. They are tactically averaging down on the interest they have to pay on their debt.

**So what happened in Q4 results and what can we learn from the conference call?**

Firstly, I am going to quote a few things said by their CEO and CFO, please make of this what you want, but these were the things I found exciting / to be careful about.

“In 2020 we added 400,000 homes passed to our fiber-to-the-home footprint. We now reached more than 2.4 million homes and are very excited about the digital customer experience we are providing to our Quantum Fiber brand.”

“…we do see lengthening sales cycles as companies continue to evaluate their new infrastructure needs.”

“First of all, we connect customers in more than 180,000 on net buildings directly to our infrastructure with secured and reliable fibers. We have deep and robust interconnections and peering facilities to the world’s eyeball networks and ISPs acquiring and distributing traffic to and from millions of endpoints. We have direct fiber connectivity to cloud service providers, hyperscalers and more than 2,200 global data-centers with tremendously scalable capacity.”

“we operate one of the world’s largest Internet backbones and carry a significant portion of the earth’s Internet traffic each and every day.”

“As of today, we have fully enabled edge facilities, covering roughly 60% of U.S. Enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency…by year-end, we expect to have more than 95% of U.S. enterprises within that same latency performance.”

**Things to get excited about:**

1. “We’re working with a major auto company on their autonomous vehicle program, helping them train their machine learning systems by building an accelerated data access network that decreases data transfer times between the metro areas they’re testing with their headquarters.”

Now, EVs require &lt;10ms of latency to be able to achieve optimum success and with self-driving in the works and LIDAR what not, Lumen is positioned at the prime spot. Lumen has tested around US and can provide &lt;5ms latency.

2. “We’re also working with a financial services company to update their computing architecture to meet exacting specifications for performance with financial counter-parties around the world.”

If this is successful, other companies will likely choose Lumen to not fall behind on their competition. Monkey see, monkey do.

3. Many other partnerships which you can search up and they will also strategically keep announcing more partnerships as 2021 progresses.

Finally, time to balance the knife and talk about all the bad things

**Bad things to consider:**

1. Macroeconomic challenges faced by the broadband business segment have a lot to do with the 61% share price decline witnessed over the last five years. The good news, however, is that Lumen is now focused on catering to enterprise customers, positioning it as one of the key infrastructure players amid the ongoing rollout of 5G technology.
2. Lumen’s traditional enterprise and consumer businesses are facing headwinds as technological developments have increased the efficiency of network usage, resulting in reduced demand for the company’s fiber network. Enterprise businesses account for approximately 75% of the company’s revenue, but many U.S. companies are increasingly embracing shared networking services, leading to a decline in demand for private networks, which has also weighed on Lumen’s revenue.
3. In addition, the consumer business segment has come under pressure as the company continues to lose broadband subscribers with speed limits below 20 Mbps, which was one of its primary drivers of earnings in the past.

The good news is that Lumen has reshaped its business model to cater to leading national telecommunication giants such as AT&amp;T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). Due to the extremely high capacity required to roll out 5G technology on a national scale, mobile carriers are depending on fiber networks, and Lumen is monetizing its expansive fiber network by catering to the largest mobile carriers in the United States.

**Some interesting questions asked in the last conference call and their relevance:**

**Q1**: “...it sounds like potentially next year there could be a several hundred million dollar impact to free cash flow and you would probably reinvest some CapEx into fiber-to-the-home. So curious, how do you think about your dividend payout ratio beyond this year pro forma some of those initiatives, and whether that changes your capital allocation initiatives at all? And in addition, if you could maybe frame-up the outlook for fiber-to-the-home within your consumer segment, how many homes you think makes sense to build to, and maybe some more color on that would be helpful?”

**A1**: So if you think about CAF II like I mentioned, we were – for last three years, we averaged more than $300 million of capital. The other thing to keep in mind is that we – through end of last year, we have enabled about 1.1 million units, and these are really in underserved areas. So we are selling into that and that revenue and penetration is picking up every quarter. So there is also cash coming in from the footprint that we have enabled. So when you look at the puts and takes going into next year of the subsidy, the capital going away, and cash coming from customers in that footprint, when you add it all up, it is not a material impact to our free cash flow. So really doesn't change anything from a capital allocation perspective.

The ubiquity of our fiber, the density of our fiber, the reach, the stand, the quality and the ability to upgrade capacity which we saw in 2020 with COVID is second to none and we'll continue to invest in building that infrastructure. But not only that, we've been able to locate our edge compute nodes with that fiber and with the peering connectivity within 5 milliseconds of the majority of the U.S. enterprises. By the end of the year, we'll be at 95%, 98% of U.S. enterprises and so there is that coupling that nobody else has, nobody else has that ability.

Clarification of confusing term (CAF II): Through CAF II, the FCC provides funding to service providers to subsidize the cost of building new network infrastructure or performing network upgrades to provide services in areas where it is lacking. ([https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/connect-america-fund-phase-ii-faqs#:\~:text=Through%20CAF%20Phase%20II%2C%20the,areas%20where%20it%20is%20lacking](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/connect-america-fund-phase-ii-faqs#:~:text=Through%20CAF%20Phase%20II%2C%20the,areas%20where%20it%20is%20lacking).)

**Q2**: We've got a new administration, a lot of focus on the digital device, there was money set aside for RDOF too. There's other programs being proposed in Congress, infrastructure builds etc. So what are you hearing from your folks in Washington, what sort of opportunities do you think this might present for Lumen? And then, perhaps you could just expand a little bit on the lengthening sales cycle. We're obviously still and the kind of pandemic, what – has anything particularly changed over the last month or two I think it's gradually getting better or any color there would be great.

**A2**: I don't really have any particular expectations. I expect something out of Lumen. I expect us to following a disciplined, financially driven logical approach to what we serve and what we don't serve. And as Neel pointed out, we think we have lots of opportunities to put our money to work inside of our existing footprint and outside to some extent. But inside our existing footprint, at better returns than some of the RDOF dollars even with the subsidies. And so, we will follow a very disciplined approach to whatever comes out of Washington.

And we'll work within the footprints that we have to deliver the best service for our customers with the best digital interactions so that they can overcome the digital device and have the best capabilities. And that's one of the things that we think we stand out on is more people work from home and educate from home. We think the symmetrical nature of our fiber footprint is a huge advantage for consumer customer or small business customers.

On the sales, the lengthening of the sales cycles. Is there anything different here? Probably not. That was what we found is people aren't resolving what is this post pandemic world look like yet, because we're not in a post-pandemic world, we're still in the middle of it.

And so, I think that it is not terribly that much different. But we thought it would be getting better by this point.

**Current Competitors: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast**

If this garners enough interest, I can provide a competitive analysis of their biggest competitors and also an analysis of their margins and where there might be room for improvement that we should see in 2021.

**TLDR**: Lumen Technologies operates one of the biggest networks of fibre networks across the globe through which they can leverage cloud-based services and 5G. They have completely transformed from CenturyLink with visible improvements and if you are betting heavily on an increasing importance paid by the US on remote working, cloud computing, and faster internet speeds then buy $LUMN with a long term hold.

And of course I cannot forget the obligatory rockets 🚀🚀

It's what it sounds like: investing in the stocks said subreddit is bullish about, and selling the ones it is bearish about. Obviously this strategy has gotten a lot of attention these past few weeks, but after running it myself for fun during this past year, the results aren't too bad. Results and how to run it yourself below.

# TL;DR

This strategy is all about getting in stocks mentioned early, riding the wave of enthusiasm from reddit to a higher price, then selling the stock before it falls too much. Over the past year, Jan 2020 - Jan 2021, this strategy returned 125.32%, had a maximum drawdown of -9.02%, and a Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return) of 2.2. For comparison, the S&amp;P 500 during the same period had a return of 16.11%, a max drawdown of -31.81%, and a Sharpe ratio of 0.50. To implement this strategy, [QuiverQuant](https://www.quiverquant.com/wallstreetbets/) is an excellent free resource with this data freely available for hand-trading.

# How it works

This algorithm searches this subreddit giving more weight to more popular posts. Then it conducts a sentiment analysis of the comments in the identified post and stores the values in a data frame. If hand-trading, QuiverQuant has this data presented in graphs and charts.

Stocks are ranked by those most popular to least popular, and then automatically bought in proportion to their relative popularity (or sold in proportion to their relative un-popularity).

Retail investor participation in the market is at an [all-time high](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retail-investor-exposure-to-stock-market-is-at-an-all-time-high-td-ameritrade-2018-01-08), and there are plenty of simple stock analysis tools to help small investors make informed decisions. If the general sentiment from retail investors is up, then they could be purchasing the underlying equity.

Here are the links to the [csv file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qydhy62v08tw4em/Reddit_Sentiment_Equity.csv?dl=0) generated from my algo.

*Doing this by hand, a good strategy may be to check QuiverQuant daily, pick the top bullish stocks (5, 10, 20) and purchase those with a fixed amount in proportion to their relative comment volume. Do the same for bearish, except sell (or purchase puts) weighted by their relative unpopularity.*

# Quick stats

**Reddit sentiment strategy (live in 2020, backtested to 2017, excluding \[redacted game store\] Event):**

* Annual return: +25.3% (125% in 2020, including **\[redacted game store\]** event)
* Max drawdown: -8.7%
* Sharpe ratio: 2.22
* Profit / Loss ratio: 3.48
* Avg. winning-trade gain: +0.85%
* Avg. losing-trade loss: -0.24%

# Weaknesses / Concerns

**Short-term:** much more volatility in reddit since **\[redacted game store\]** Event. The investing subreddits ballooning in membership may have a dramatic effect on noise in the subreddit, and so these erratic trading signals could confuse the strategy. Newer investors may also cause more erratic and wide swings in targeted stocks, and the demographic changes in the community may make coordinated behavior (which this strategy relies on) less reliable.

QuiverQuant has free datasets, including one on the volume and sentiment of tickers mentioned on reddit. For hand-trading, I have found it useful to look at these datasets frequently and make adjustments accordingly following the algorithm outlined in the How It Works section.

*Doing this by hand, a good strategy may be to check QuiverQuant daily, pick the top bullish stocks (5, 10, 20) and purchase those with a fixed amount in proportion to their relative comment volume. Do the same for bearish, except sell (or purchase puts) weighted by their relative unpopularity.*",stocks,125.3% 2020 Return from Reddit Sentiment Analysis Stock-Picker Algo,21.0,0.82

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li9qnq/magnachip\_mx\_expected\_to\_beat\_q4\_guidance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li9qnq/magnachip_mx_expected_to_beat_q4_guidance/)

MX, the #2 OLED smartphone screen display chip maker, had a huge beat of Q4 2020 earnings but the stock was largely flat. Several reasons for this:

* MX exceeded expectations of $0.13 EPS and reported $0.40 EPS
* Gross margin of 26.9% vs. Q3 GM of 22.9% and up from 24.7% in Q4 2019: expected to have increasing GM as power division produces higher margin products
* Net cash of +$200mm on a market cap of $700mm
* 2020 Adj EBITDA of $53MM up 29% from 2019, so EV/EBITDA of \~9x and trading at 12-13x P/2021 E (removing net cash of $200mm and adding in interest payments). MX Price / Sales of 0.9x (74x EV/EBITDA) vs. 3.1x for HIMX and 5.2x for SYNA (24x EV/EBITDA)
* **LCD DDIC and AMOLED chipmaker HIMX reported blowout earnings on Feb 4, only to see its stock drop from 11.50 at open to close at 10.86 (-5.5%) on Feb 4 and then rocket to high of $17.88 as analysts rerated and word got out.** 
* **3 MX analysts rerated the stock to $30 and believe MX will see a similar trajectory as HIMX as the information and data is digested.**

On that $200mm of cash or 30% of market cap, MX will provide on their Analyst Day Apr 21 “a comprehensive plan for our near-term capital allocation, our liquidity, leverage policy and our ongoing **shareholder distribution.**” **They did not mention any acquisitions and very likely will have a extraordinary dividend.** 

**On new products:** “our engineering team has been very busy throughout the year, engaging with the customer to develop new products in emerging technologies and applications such as OLED TV, micro LED TV and OLED automotive.” **Starting production of OLED TV DDICs in second half of 2021**

**5G OLED growth skyrocketing:** “We see the 5G smartphone more than doubling. And if you look at even the fourth quarter results, about 70% of revenue were from 5G with a HFR feature. So I can confirm that the demand is very strong.” 5G smartphone units are expected to go from 250mm last year to 550mm in 2021. **In Q4, 70% of MX OLED revenue was 5G and HFR.**

**Other Bullish Market Data Points:**

* China smartphones sales are growing at nearly 100% year over year (In China, handset shipments reached 40 million units in January, increasing 93% from a year earlier, said the sources, citing data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT))
* Display driver IC testing houses Chipbond Technology and ChipMos Technologies have also seen clients queue up for high-end testing capacity support for 5G TDDI ICs and OLED DDI chips, with such capacity to remain short of demand throughout first-half 2021.
* **Apple LTPO OLED screens are supplied 100% by Samsung, and LG is also reportedly jockeying to cut into LTPO supply to Apple in 2022. LG does not make DDICs in house so MX will become an Apple supplier in 2022 if LG wins this business (source:** [**https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-secures-100-of-the-120Hz-LTPO-display-orders-for-the-iPhone-13-Pros.513944.0.html**](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-secures-100-of-the-120Hz-LTPO-display-orders-for-the-iPhone-13-Pros.513944.0.html)**)**

**Valuation is still incredibly cheap.** MX Price / Sales of 0.9x (9x EV/EBITDA) vs. 3.1x for HIMX and 5.2x for SYNA (24x EV/EBITDA). **MX will rerate to a +20x EV/EBITDA valuation which would imply an EV of $1.2 bln and equity price of $50-$55 -&gt; 100-150% upside with very limited downside given the massive cash on balance sheet.**",stocks,Update: Magnachip MX Still 100-150% Undervalued at 9x EV/EBITDA: #2 Global Supplier of OLED 5G Smartphone Display Chips,20.0,0.9
Spactaculous,0.0,22.0,"Got in pre market this morning after reading a little bit about the short seller, their claims and watching the short seller video (basically a security guard walking through an empty office on a holiday). Let's leave that aside because it is not relevant now.

The stock is bouncing back and settled under $70 at this time, which seems to be a resistance. Most of the volume in $65-$68.

It is very tempting to take profits here, but at the same time it was over $100 just before the crash. Many say even $70 is overpriced, but at the same time this company is further ahead in R&amp;D than the other electric multirotors. They actually have people flying on it.

At the end of the day, this is in gambling territory now. And there are no options unfortunately.

With that said, today I will focus on the 5G sector, where the huge potential of companies competing in this field I think is not yet met. My choice is for a company from Hamilton, Bermuda, $MRVL – Marvell Technology Group Ltd., founded in 1995. Don't confuse it with the cartoon franchise. 

$Marvell designs, develops, and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits. It offers a portfolio of Ethernet solutions, including controllers, network adapters, physical transceivers, and switches; single or multiple core processors; custom application specific integrated circuits; and printer SoC products and application processors. The company also provides a range of storage products comprising storage controllers for hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drives that support various host system interfaces consisting of serial attached SCSI (SAS), serial advanced technology attachment (SATA), peripheral component interconnect express, non-volatile memory express (NVMe), and NVMe over fabrics; and fiber channel products, including host bus adapters, and controllers for server and storage system connectivity. 

It has operations in the United States, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. With its profile, it is normal that the company to be involved heavily in the 5G sector, which presents great opportunities for growth. This new industry has yet to reach maturity and companies present in the market try heavily to invest in innovation and in conquering as much market share as possible. Main competitors of $MRVL are strong also ($Micron, $qualcomm etc), but there is a shortage of reliable solutions, a lot of room to develop and occupy niches and market gaps. I think that those who will put a strong foot now, at the dawn of the 5G era, in this industry, have a lot of growth potential. 

Now, $MRVL it has a P/E Ratio (TTM) of 24.26 and an EPS of 2.18. The next earnings release is scheduled for 2nd March. Analysts expect Marvell earnings of 29 cents a share, up 71% year over year, on sales of $794.7 million, up 11%. If it hits those numbers, it will mark its fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. The company is benefiting from a cyclical upturn in semiconductor sales. I do not think this stock is overvalued and with a price right now if $52, a price target of $55 and a high estimate of $64, there is a lot of room to gain. It is normal to consider it a good buy entry point and I will invest for the next months.

I also wrote a post about a penny stock that I cannot mention here, but went up 140% at the time of writing. Check my profile if you're interested in that. I think I have another winner on my hands: EXPI

EXPI might genuinely be the AMZN of housing. They are a real estate company that works WITH realtors so that they can buy and sell their houses. In exchange, they get a commission for helping secure the sell. Right now, they’re worth $11 billion. Their YoY growth was 99.9%, absolutely crushing Zillow’s pathetic returns. Yet Z is worth 4 times EXPI's current evaluation, at 40 billion. That’s right, EXPI is less expensive AND it is growing faster. The only thing that Z has is [revenue](https://i.imgur.com/Ok2CRoU.jpg), but if EXPI continues at its current rate, or even halves, it will still be making more than Zillow.

If you’re bullish on the housing market. EXPI is a must hold. Sure, they gained 1000%. They went from penny stock levels to small to mid-cap levels in a year. This thing will be worth over $40 billion as soon as they pass Zillow. But why stop there? They’re growing absolutely astronomically.

Let's imagine I have an account on DEGIRO, Interactive Brokers, and Trading 212. So three different brokers. And I have bought stocks in companies like Tesla, Nvidia, etc. and also different ETFs (physically backed).

1. Who exactly is the lawful owner of my shares? Do I own everything and are they *in my name*?
2. What role does the stock exchange play here? For example, I can buy certain stocks from either NYSE or LSE or MIB. What difference does that make (except for the obvious things like currency of course)?
3. Is there something like bookkeeping for stocks and investments? Who holds these records? Stock exchanges? Or only brokers?
4. Are there any other ways to prove you really own the stocks you bought other than screenshots and confirmation emails from your online broker?
5. What happens if a broker goes bust, bankrupt, or just disappears one day? Or better yet, can a broker run away with your investments? What happens to my stocks? Like if I had 10 shares in 'iShares Core S&amp;P 500', who do I go to now? To iShares? Or to the stock exchange where I bought them in the first place?
6. Can you lose your investments out of the blue without you doing anything wrong or selling them? Like, could someone confiscate them? Or could you lose access to your online broker and all of your shares forever under any circumstances? How can you protect your shares from unforeseen circumstances?

elvita12345,0.0,21.0,"# Overview 

Vital Farms is a certified B-Corp focused on ethically growing pasture raised eggs and butter. They do this by partnering with roughly 200 family farms that share the mentality of putting the welfare of the animals before anything else and engaging in sustainable farming practices. All of the farms are located in “The Pasture Belt”, an area notorious for favorable weather all year long.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Matt O’Hayer in 2007. He is the founder and former president of the Organic Egg Farmers of America and is still the Executive Chairman and Director of Vital Farms.

The current CEO is Russell Diez-Canseco. Previous work experience includes McKinsey &amp; Company, H-E-B Grocery, and the Central Intelligence Agency (he also has an MBA from Harvard University).

Other senior management members have extensive experience in the food industry.

The company has a 4.2 rating on Glassdoor (50 reviews), 88% approval of the CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and motivation with the company’s ethical mission. A few reviews complain about managers (not uncommon on Glassdoor) and about the company’s culture.

# Industry and competition 

Vital Farms is active in the highly-competitive and fragmented US food industry with a focus on retail consumers and a few partnerships with restaurants.

Notable competitors include Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ: CALM), Rose Care Farms and other major US egg producers.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

Vital Farms differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the ethical side of the production and farming of its eggs and dairy products. Customers and reviewers claim the products are of higher quality and of greater taste due to the production approach they’re taking. Customer reviews and satisfaction is extremely high (their standard egg carton has a 4.9 out of 5 rating on Amazon based on 5,985 reviews with customers praising the premium quality).

Although their eggs are pricier than competitors, consumers haven’t been minding shelling out the difference for the premium quality. 

Their marketing is unique and exceptional amongst competitors. To exemplify a part of this, they allow buyers to check out the farm where their eggs were laid in a 360 degree video to see if it’s up to snuff and they have a reward program for filling up a “pasture passport” with the names of 10 different farms.

Their branding and packaging is also really strong and although it is still a small company, it is starting to show strong brand loyalty among its consumers (a significant percentage of first-time buyers during the COVID-19 pandemic became repeat buyers according to the CEO).

Although the company does not have a truly strong moat at the moment, in my opinion they’re well on their way to building themselves one by the customer loyalty they’re amassing and the network of small farms they’re building.

# Areas of growth

The company has been willing and adventurous when it comes to expanding their product line into sub-products (Egg bites, hard boiled eggs, liquid whole eggs) and completely new segments (butter). A natural next-step for the company at this point, in my opinion, would be to expand their dairy products further (milk, cream, etc.) to tap into other large markets.

Partnerships with large restaurant chains willing to back sustainable farming practices could also be a catalyst for growth.

One could argue there is also potential internationally for Vital Farms, but I believe this is very far-off the current road-map. 

# Potential headwinds 

As previously mentioned, the industry they operate in is highly fragmented and it’s unlikely Vital Farms will own a majority of market share in their segment. The egg and dairy industry is also notoriously smaller and has a lower CAGR than other high-flying fast-growing industries, so Vital Farm’s TAM and market cap growth is capped unless they manage to go international successfully or tap into new product and revenue streams.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

Paradigm_Warp,0.0,20.0,"Back during the 3rd &amp; 4th quarter of 2020, I sold most of my short positions and, very stupidly, impulsively re-invested heavily in Crispr based companies such as CRSP, EDIT, NTLA, CRIS &amp; ARKG. It was purely speculative and based solely on the belief that this form of medical therapies are/will be the future. For a while I was confident in my belief, seeing each ticker jump and eventually even reach their 52 week highs. Unfortunately currently they’ve all sunk back. This is my heaviest set back so far, but not one I’m afraid of. I’m just concerned it will take longer than expected to free up my capital to better invest elsewhere and properly apply my lessons better for future investments. 

My question is: if anyone knows, what can I expect for the short term future? What’s the outlook for these companies? 

A lot of my research is done through Google News, advice and really reading through forums. Although my educational background is in finance, I’ve never made use of my background to do any real due diligence and definitely have imposter syndrome. I’ve had an amazing streak since I’ve began investing but this was the riskiest thing I’ve done so far, and it’s definitely a lesson learned.

jonny_blank,0.0,19.0,"My dad has done manual labor his whole life, specifically carpentry/contracting for the past 30 or so years. As mentioned in the title, he is getting up there in age, but still plans to be actively working until 70-72. It pains me and scares me when I see him climbing up 50ft on ladders and lifting heavy materials. I wish that I could help support my parents in retirement but they had a fairly late start to building a family so I am not in a position to financially assist them. 

A few years ago my dad scored a really big job and was able to put aside \~$10k. He knows I invest/trade so he asked me for some advice. But being in my 20s I have a much different risk tolerance than him. 

# GOAL: 

I believe my dad would like to grow his portfolio over the next 5 years and then be able to collect monthly/quarterly dividends to help support him and my mom. 

Because he is starting fairly late in life I'm not sure how he can get the best results, here are my thoughts on how his portfolio should be structured:

# 5-10% High Growth: 

Something that has high growth potential in the next 5 years to grow his portfolio. I'm thinking weed stocks, renewables, ???

# 70% Dividend:

Looking for stocks, ETFs that he can use DRIP for the next 5 years before collecting monthly/quarterly payments. 

**$SPHD $MMM $T $WY**

Other recommendations? 

# 10% Medium Growth 

Possibly some ETFs in promising sectors. I like **$BOTZ,** any others?

# 5-10% ???

There was a story about how in Russia there where massive lines of trucks of wheat trying to leave the country before the export tax of wheat is set to double over night .

THIS IS IMPORTANT because Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat ,which means that steady supply of wheat that Russia exports too will now look to other suppliers to fulfil that demand.

This is where Australia is coming in ,Australia loves agriculture and we export a lot and our farmers are looking to invest in the market to accommodate that new market Russia held .

rpoh73189,0.0,19.0,"For folks saying last week was a crash / correction. We barely lost 5% on the Nasdaq and SP was down about half that. That is not a correction. That’s normal course of selling. Correction is that 8-10% range and feels very likely to still come. 

There are a lot of reasons for a correction.

1) Interest rates rising is a legitimate concern and who knows where they really head from here

2) Inflation is going to come. Economics 101, M2 money supply goes up, inflation goes up. Passing another $1T bill is going to make this even more apparent. Possible that Interest rates may be signaling. This could potentially be a much larger issue (reference Michael Burrys thesis on this, it makes a lot of sense)

3) Valuations are crazy. This one is a bit weaker because of all the QE/low rates/stimulus I’d expect crazy valuations comparative to history. Still it makes noise. 

4) Institutional money is sitting on enormous long term gains from March of last year that they are going to trim and rotate into different names over time. Plus end of quarter is typically rebalancing time and you see an uptick in volatility. 

Just my two cents, more selling is coming but likely to return to regularly scheduled bull market after.

I have been tracking insider trades for a few weeks now and there are barely any days when I see large amounts of insider buying.

**Highlights**

- Generated total revenues of approximately $116.9 million, net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $64.4 million and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) of approximately $97.8 million, representing increases of 162%, 191% and 180% over 2019, respectively.
- Recorded $3.27 of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share and $5.00 of adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) per diluted share, representing increases of 61% and 53% over 2019, respectively.
- Declared dividends to common stockholders totaling $4.47 per share, a 58% increase over 2019.
- Closed on over $620 million in new acquisitions and additional investments at existing properties (including commitments to fund future development/redevelopment, but excluding transaction costs), including 20 new property acquisitions, expanding IIP’s footprint to 66 properties totaling 5.4 million rentable square feet in 17 states at year-end.

&gt;*A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a corporation that combines the capital of many investors to acquire income producing real estate. As a public company traded on the NYSE, we are uniquely positioned in the industry to access public capital markets. As a REIT, one of our most attractive attributes is that we must distribute through a dividend to our stockholders at least 90 percent of our taxable income.[Innovative Industrial Properties has paid consecutive quarterly dividends to our common stockholders since the second quarter of 2017](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=IIPR).*

Imo, this is an excellent play for those who want exposure in the US Cannabis Industry without taking on too much risk. This company offers tremendous growth with impressive dividends.

IIPR partners with licensed operators across all products types: 
1) Cultivation
2) Processing
3) Distribution

The company owns approximately 70 properties located in 17 states totaling approximately 6million square feet 

...That’s alot of rent!

**Sale Leaseback Program**

Innovative Industrial Properties acquires freestanding industrial and retail properties from state-licensed medical-use cannabis operators. The properties are then leased back under long-term, absolute net lease agreements. They focus on well-capitalized companies that have successfully gone through the rigorous state licensing process and have been granted a license in the state where the property is located.

&gt;*We act as a source of capital to these state-licensed operators by acquiring and leasing back their real estate. This allows for the opportunity to redeploy the proceeds into core operations, yielding a higher return than they would otherwise get from owning real estate.*

EXAMPLE:
- Targeted deal size - $5 million to $30+ million
- Additional expansion capital available
- Lease term – 10 to 20 years
- Initial base rent – 10% to 16% on total investment (based on property underwriting)
- Annual base rent escalations – 3% to 4.5%
- Security deposit and corporate guaranty based on credit underwriting
- Transaction timeline – closing 30 to 60 days from signed purchase and sale agreement

**Conclusion**

IIPR provides a ripe opportunity to invest in the cannabis industry while providing growth/dividends, *HOWEVER*, I personally think it is a bit overbought(98%). Closed right around ATH today of 222.082usd.

I am looking to swing trade here &amp; enter below 200usd with additional support around 180. (Anything under 200 is a buy imo) ...Buystops placed @ 225usd in case of bullish continuation. I plan to re-evaluate calls if/when premiums start to drop.

**First** (technical) —&gt; 3/19/21 200 Ps @ 4.80

Sell ~190usd 

**Second** (fundamental) —&gt; 1/21/22 200 Cs (*will re-evaluate premium*)

I strongly encourage everyone to do their own DD and deepdive the management here, as I am not a Financial Advisor. Imo, IIPR is poised for significant growth.

=========

UMC: United Microelectronics Corp

UMC is a semiconductor foundry based in Hsinchu, Taiwan. It started as a spinoff of Taiwan’s national semiconductor research arm and was the first Taiwanese semiconductor to be listed in NYSE. During its early days of foundation, many key figures who later built the TSM success, including Morris Chang, worked at UMC. Late January UMC announced its 2020 Q4 result. Its net profit exceeds NT$10 billion (US$357.1 million) in that quarter, with profits for 2020 reaching a 14-year high of NT$29.19 billion. On Feb.8 UMC also announced its January 2021 net sales grew more than 10% YoY.

Personal pros:

\-UMC is like a miniature TSM, with a lot of support from the Taiwanese gov and a strong footing in global semiconductor foundry business. With most of the money chasing TSM, UMC has the potential to catch up as a lagger.

\-The world is experiencing a severe shortage of automobile chips and even TSM is burdened with a heavy load of rush orders. UMC’s products are heavily demanded by automobile industry. Recently UMC’s executives met with Taiwan gov to discuss speeding up car chips production.

\-Price of UMC stocks now fluctuates between $10-$11. It is already a 400% hike from a year ago but is still cheap enough to buy a large lot.

My personal cons:

\-The majority of UMC’s production facilities (9) are in Taiwan, with three others in Singapore, mainland China and Japan respectively. Strained politics could cause issue for UMC’s product delivery.

\- UMC acquired Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor in 2019 to enhance its indigenous capabilities, but they are still much weaker than TSM and other big names. It is, to its core, a foundry focused on production rather than development. UMC’s most advanced node of production stands at 14nm, while TSM and others have mature 7nm node lines and are advancing to 5nm and 3nm nodes.

==========

AMAT?

I am trying to identify companies similar to UMC but haven’t had much success. The majority of UMC's counterparts are listed in Taiwan, China and HK. I am not quite familiar with the European side, so I looked back at the US and had some thoughts about AMAT.

AMAT is like an infrastructure stock for semiconductor industry. It is the largest global producer of equipment essential to every semiconductor manufacturer and designer, competing against the likes of ASML and Lam Research. Buying AMAT sounds like a sure-win strategy: every winner and loser in the semiconductor business needs its products.

But AMAT is hardly “overlooked”. There are a lot of talks about the company and big money is already chasing the stock after its announcement of better-than-expected results this week. I am thinking about buying some AMAT as a short-term gamble.

Decided to look into Clover Health (Ticker: CLOV) since I’ve been hearing recommendation on it for the dip. Started with all the pros of the company and thought it was great! Growth! Growth! Growth! But then once I got to the cons that hype dropped to the ground fast. I wanted to create this post to save time for anyone that might be interested in CLOV. Citations are at the end so you can do your own research. I do have a position in CLOV as I think the stock could rebound a little via technical analysis. Not a financial advice.

**Summary (if lazy):**

A stock that was hyped by Chamath. If cleared by DOJ and short, there are potential for growth. However, some allegations are hard to turn your head the other way. Also, important to note that it’s David vs bunch of Goliath in this heavily regulated industry. CEO kinda sketchy. At this point, cons over weighs the pros.

Atm price dropped down to a pretty good resistance near $10.60 - $11.00, I’ll be buying hoping for rebound with news fading away and earnings on March 1.

My position atm is **~~15 $12.5 CALL 5/21~~**

**Update 2/22:** After further research, seeing how every other MA company has had bad reaction after earnings, I've decided to let go my position today.

*\*\*Post will be edited and updated based off any informative comments.*

**Basic Info of the Company:**

**1** **About the company**

* Clover health is a data driven healthcare technology company (Backed by Alphabet Inc/Google) based in San Francisco that provides Medicare Advantage products to seniors and low-income members. As of early 2020 they had 57,000 members with plans offered in 34 counties across seven state. Their plan for expansion will bring coverage to a total of 64 additional counties. This expansion will increase Clover’s market opportunity to nearly 5 million Medicare eligible.

**2** **Difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage plan**

* Original Medicare (parts A and B) is offered by the government and covers some of the costs of hospitals (part A) and doctor visits (part B) – but it may not offer the full coverage you need. This can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to significant costs if you need to visit the hospital.
* Medicare Advantage plans (part C) give you all the coverage of original Medicare and often include part D prescription drug coverage. In addition, they may offer dental and vision benefit + others…

**3** **What’s different about Clover Advantage Plan**

* As stated at #1, Clover Health provides Medicare Advantage Plan. Which means they will cover everything stated above in #2. Additionally, they give you access to better prescription drug coverage than standalone part D plans, as well as additional benefits like low cost.

**4 They have a unique model in health insurance**

* Clover partners with primary care physicians using its software platform, the Clover Assistant, to deliver data-driven, personalized insights at the point of care.

# Pros

**1. Clover Assistant\*\*\*\*****^(1\*)**

* This is their flagship platform that aggregates millions of relevant health data points – including claims, medical charts, and diagnostics, among others – and uses machine learning to synthesize that data with member-specific information. This provides physicians with actionable and personalized insights at the point of care, offering suggestions for medications and dosages as well as the need for tests or referrals, among other, to ultimately improve health outcomes.
* Basically, this new software makes the doctors happy (unlike the legacy systems) and makes the patients happy as it allows them to save money and have better patient outcomes.

**2.** **Fastest Growing Medicare advantage insurer in the US**

* Clover captured an average of 50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the last three years. Because of their target demographic, it makes it easier for them to expand into historically undeserved and rural communities. As mentioned above, they are planning to expand into an additional 74 counties and announced a new partnership with Walmart to make joint Clover-Walmart plans available to half a million medicare-eligibles in the eight Georgia counties.

\*\*3. The market\*\*\*\*\*\***^(2\*)**

* The health market is one of the largest in the country representing $3.8 trillion or 17.8% of gross domestic product in 2019. Furthermore, healthcare expenditures are forecasted to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2028. An important part of this market is the insurance industry, and more specifically the Medicare plans which in 2020 had more than 62 million people enrolled in, and 39% of those people (24.1million) enrolled in Medicare advantage plans.
* Democratic government means expansion on ACA (affordable care act) increasing health insurer’s growth prospects in that market.

This is one of the major catalysts to investors when it comes to investing in CLOV. I’ll go over some of the main issue from the Hindenburg research and answers provided by Clover Health. If you’d like to check out the report yourself checkout citation below^(3\*).

It’s important to note that Clover Health did provide a rebuttal/answers (quite long) to all the points on Hindenburg Research^(4\*). Hindenburg then replied to that as well lol^(5\*).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Critically Clover has not disclosed that its business model and its software offering, called the clover assistant, are under active investigation by the DOJ, which is investigating at least 12 issues ranging from kick backs to marketing practices to undisclosed third-party deals, according to a civil investigative demand we obtained.*

* Clover Response - Discussed to lawyer about it, and they said it’s not necessary to let the public know.
* Thoughts – Really comes down to SPEC vs IPO, with SPEC being looser and in the grey area. It would have been the right thing to inform the public investors of these information, now they’ll have to deal with all the lawsuits. Next, the civil investigative demand from DOJ was received by a formal employee of CLOV and not CLOV itself. CLOV did receive a request for information from DOJ but not a civil investigative demands or subpoenas from DOJ. This tells me it’s unclear if an investigation have been opened for CLOV or if it’s just inquiries jumping around.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Clover has a thinly disclosed subsidiary called “Seek Insurance”. Seek makes no mention of its relationship with Clover on its website yet misleadingly advertises to seniors that it offers “independent” and “unbiased” advice on selecting Medicare plans. It claims, “We don’t work for insurance companies. We work for you”, despite literally being owned by Clover, an insurance company. Its activities are also under investigation by the DOJ.

* Clover Response – Seek is a start up that is set up as a separate company from clover. Provides seek sales in the most recent AEP: #1 Cigna:20%, #2 Humana:20%, #3 CVS/Aetna:17%, #4 Clover:13.5%...
* Thoughts – Doesn’t look good on Clover’s end. Seek can’t state it provides unbiased report when 50% of its stake is owned by clover.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Multiple former employees explained that much of Clover’s sales are fueled by a major undisclosed relationship between Clover and an outside brokerage firm controlled by Clover’s Head of Sales, Hiram Bermudez. One former employee estimated Bermudez drove \~68% of Clover’s total sales, though was unclear on the amount coming from the undisclosed relationship.

* Clover Response – Admits that there is transaction between B&amp;H assurance and says Bermudez still work on behalf of B&amp;H in case he quits Clover.
* Thoughts – Admitting to this is good but 100% conflict of interest. However, its not unusual for insurance companies to use brokers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Clover reported that “onboarded” physicians used Clover Assistant for 92% of member visits in 2019, but never defined “onboarded”. We found that less than half of Clover’s in-network doctors are considered “Clover Preferred”. What is the definition of an “onboarded” physician? What percentage of Clover’s in-network doctors actually use the Clover Assistant?

* Clover Response –onboarding = physicians that went through training for clover assistant.contracting = explained benefit of clover assistant to the physicians and they have agreed to use it.Currently 22% of all in-network primary care physicians are live. This correlate to 4% of the total in-network physicians. In YE2020 56% of the membership were attributed to one of those 22% live PCPs. And an additional 11% are attributed to a PCP who is contracted but in the onboarding pipeline. In conclusion, 67% total coverage of clover assistant as of YE2020
* Thoughts – wordings are confusing on clovers part, but the numbers do not look as bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Clover claims its software “delights” physicians, but according to doctors and former employees we interviewed, they use it because Clover pays them extra to use it. Physicians are paid $200 per visit to use the software, twice the normal reimbursement rate for a Medicare visit.

* Clover Response – just incentivizing to use the software. The $200 is not to use the software but represents the overall payment that covers both the PCP office visit and the use of the clover assistant.
* Thoughts – Clover were pretty up front about this issue, not too relevant imo.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a CNBC interview announcing the Clover transaction, Chamath proclaimed, unprompted, “they create transparency…they don’t motivate doctors to up code or do all kinds of things to get paid”. A former employee explained to us that the DOJ is specifically asking about upcoding, or the practice of overbilling Medicare.

* Clover Response – agrees upcoding is a problem in the industry. They pay pcp fixed flat payment per office visit which does not incentivize physicians to up code. They keep old diagnosis just in case, so it shows up again
* Thoughts – I don’t think it was well addressed how their system fails to remove old irrelevant diagnoses which could affect Medicare advantage reimbursements leading to upcoding.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **CEO of Clover Health is kinda sketchy**

Before I start, it’s important to note that these information below were available in 2020 before the merger announcement. I’ll just directly copy paste what Hindenburg report wrote but you can find different articles on google^(3\*).

* Prior to founding Clover, CEO Vivek Garipalli owned 3 New Jersey hospitals through a company called CarePoint Health. CarePoint was publicly lambasted for price-gouging; its hospital charged the highest prices for emergency room treatment in the entire country. For example, local media reported that Garipalli’s hospitals charged a teacher $9,000 for a bandaged finger and a tetanus shot, and another patient $17,000 for 5-6 stiches on a cut hand.
* CarePoint’s predatory price-gouging was lucrative. But in 2020, New Jersey legislators accused Garipalli – now a public company CEO – of siphoning over $157 million from his hospital network through a byzantine web of LLC shell entities. The transactions left the hospitals financially crippled, leading to layoffs and a liquidating sale process to new owners.

AppHarvest is a publicly traded Indoor Farming based in the US. While there are several other in door farming companies like Gotham Greens and AeroFarms, APPH is the only one of the bunch that is publicly traded. Indoor farming, IMO is the future, and there currently is no dominant company like Tesla, Amazon, Apple in the AggTech Space. APPH only has a market cap of $4B. **Investing in APPH will not only position you for the future, but also allow you to capitalize on the sustainability movement**.

The market share of indoor farms in the total aggriculture market is very small, giving lots of room for growth. Indoor farming only produces roughly 14B of goods compared to 400b of production in US. **At a market cap of 4B, I bought APPH for the growth potential and my belief that there will one day be a dominant Aggtech player and that indoor farms will take over farming in the future**. In comparison, Tesla has a 750B market cap.

APPH is based in Kentucky. The founder, Jonathan Webb grew up in Kentucky and went to University of Kentucky. It makes me feel like he's in this for the long haul and wants to give back to the community there. Webb has aspirations to make Kentucky the Aggtech capital of USA. Kentucky is also a strategic location in that it has cheap land and access to rain water.

So why indoor farming:

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Benefits Of Indoor Farming**: This is pretty self explanatory but I will name a few

* **Less use of water**: APPH and other indoor farms claim to use 90% less water than conventional farms. [https://www.appharvest.com/](https://www.appharvest.com/)
* **Can grow year round**
* **Not dependent on climate**
* **Can be done vertically to take up less space**
* **Can be grown without the use of pesticides** \- decreasing chemicals released

In a nutshell, Indoor Farming is the way of the future. With climate change, outdoor farming has become unpredictable. Much of US farming is only able to sell their goods for so cheap due to subsidies. Fresh water is also decreasing and desalination is expensive. [https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water) The human population continues to grow and food shortages is a legitimate problem - hence some companies are looking into bugs as the protein of the future. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/climate/climate-change-food-supply.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/climate/climate-change-food-supply.html) , [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/bug-protein-how-entrepreneurs-are-persuading-americans-to-eat-insects.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/bug-protein-how-entrepreneurs-are-persuading-americans-to-eat-insects.html) No matter what the solution is, the fact is, **we need to feed humans and we need to do it in a more efficient way**.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Indoor Farming vs. Conventional Farming**:

Currently, indoor farming is still a bit more expensive than conventional farming. APPH is selling it's tomatoes as 'organic' which allows it to price it higher. However, the trend is reversing. While outdoor farming continues to face increasing costs due to use of pesticides, climate change, and water costs, indoor farming faces the opposite problem. Many US outdoor farms are only able to sell at cheap prices due to subsidies. Advancements in technology well continue to decrease the costs for indoor farming. Conventional farms also usually are located far from populous areas and will have additional supply chain costs. Indoor farms can be located wherever it makes sense to be located. For more info: [https://www.growcomputer.io/blog/2020/3/9/change-in-agriculture](https://www.growcomputer.io/blog/2020/3/9/change-in-agriculture)

Costs of indoor farming include the initial investment cost of building the facility. After that, the main repeat cost is electricity to power the led lamps. However, it is still sustainable after electric costs: [https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/post/is-vertical-farming-really-sustainable](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/post/is-vertical-farming-really-sustainable) Indoor farms as mentioned see vast reduction in needs for water, pesticides, land area, supply chain, and other costs that traditional farms see.

**Indoor farming is already very successful**. Believe it or not, tiny Neterhlands is the SECOND largest exporter of food, after the US - all due to the their ability to farm indoors. National Geographic did an excerpt here: [https://investinholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NFIA-National-Geographic-Article\_final-A4.pdf](https://investinholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NFIA-National-Geographic-Article_final-A4.pdf) In door farm technology can be used to grow crops anywhere, even in the Sahara.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Indoor Farming Has ALOT of Potential**: Besides what's listed above, indoor farming can leverage AI in making farms automated and increase yield. Tech companies have been investing in indoor farms due to the potential to use technology and AI to increase yield and produce crops. [http://economyleague.org/providing-insight/regional-direction/2018/08/10/the-promise-and-peril-of-vertical-farming](http://economyleague.org/providing-insight/regional-direction/2018/08/10/the-promise-and-peril-of-vertical-farming) Additionally, the US governemnt has been eyeing ways to support indoor farming: [https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future)

I truely believe, whether or not people like to think in those terms, that water and food will become a scarcer resource in the future. I also truly believe that indoor farming is the future, especially as we as humans look to become more sustainable.

I'm not usually big on celebrity endorsers, but Martha Stewart is firmly behind APPH. [https://www.greenhousegrower.com/crops/martha-stewart-among-big-names-joining-appharvest-team/](https://www.greenhousegrower.com/crops/martha-stewart-among-big-names-joining-appharvest-team/)

Like any budding industry, the market is currently pretty fragmented, but APPH is the one I am backing due to strategic location, tech, and company CEO. They also have David Lee on the team, who was the CFO of Impossible Foods. This means it's ripe for a dominant player to show up. All indoor farms should grow and capture some market share from traditional farms, regardless who you back.

CytoSorbents sells a cytokine adsorbing column (""CytoSorb"" which received CE mark approval in 2011) -- a blood purification technology based on porous polymer beads that act like sponges in an attempt to remove harmful inflammatory mediators like Cytokines, Bilirubin, Myoglobin from the blood.

The use of hemoperfusion columns is generally limited to patients who are critically ill in high-resource counties, and they require a patient to be connected to a hemofiltration system such as Dialysis, Hemofiltration Cardiopulmonary bypass or ECMO. Other blood purification devices are using different technologies with different performance parameters. This is including polymyxin B hemoperfusion columns (Toraymyxin), which failed to show significance in a clinical trial for sepsis. The CytoSorb technology has actually the largest body of clinical data confirming safety and efficacy.

The filter they produce is used to treat sepsis in hospitals and is already approved in the EU. Once approved it's very possible you'll see this product in every single hospital in the united states due to its plug and play capability.

FDA approval sends this thing to the moon. Or it could be potentially bought out by a bigger biotech company once approved. It's already approved in Europe so it's just a matter of time before it's approved in the US.

**Conclusion**

To conclude I think this is a great long-term play. It doesn't have the volatility of other biotechs and has room for a lot of growth. Potentially once approved I think it could hit around 40$ a share, with room to go much higher based on its small float.",stocks,DD - The small-cap Pharma stock with big upside.... $CTSO,19.0,0.87

**Introduction**

There’s much discussion in some posts regarding the distinction between MSO’s and LP’s commanding market share post legalization, with compelling arguments on each side of the aisle. 

The bull argument is a home run play. Entry and transition from [approximately $7 Billion CAD](https://cannabusinessplans.com/canadian-cannabis-market/)
forecasted market to a market that is [projected to be as much as $37 Billion USD by 2025](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mjbizdaily.com/exclusive-us-retail-marijuana-sales-on-pace-to-rise-40-in-2020-near-37-billion-by-2023/). By this line of reasoning, almost anyone can beat the market. There is plenty of bullish sentiment in this community and others. Therefore, I will spare your time on this.

**Enter the USMCA**

Drafted in 2018 and effective on July 1st, 2020, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced NAFTA as the preceding law regarding trade. The prospect of free trade across three countries who’ve legalized cannabis would have an enormous impact. 

&gt; “ Like NAFTA, USMCA will include a Free Trade Commission (“FTC”) comprised of delegates from each party-country. Those delegates will be tasked with monitoring and implementing USMCA. Crucially for cannabis, the FTC may form “working groups” for particular topics. There will be no limitation as to what might be addressed in a working group: rather, the delegates can work on whatever seems relevant.” [1]

&gt; “Do we think all of this is realistic? Absolutely, and it could happen in any number of ways. Here in Oregon, for example, pro-cannabis U.S. Senator Ron Wyden sits on the USMCA trade committee. The Pacific Northwest has a prominent role in trade policy—especially with Canada—so the required base of political support is already in place. Oregon has shown thought leadership on cannabis export generally, and state officials coordinate well with Mr. Wyden and other federal representatives. Industry should push here.” [1]

However, the devil may be in the details. 

**Bearish Thesis**

The bear argument surrounds the reality behind Canadian entry into the US Market. 

For starters, there’s the cost to entry. Vince Sliwosky, professor of cannabis law at Lewis and Clark, [stipulates the possibility of treating cannabis as a commodity of heightened surveillance, with heightened transaction costs, regulation, and tariffs.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/robcannabispro/article-how-usmca-could-pave-the-way-for-cannabis-free-trade/). While optimistic about Cannabis overall, Vince identifies this area as a concern:

&gt; “They wouldn’t have to actually amend the [USMCA] agreement because [cannabis] would just be treated like a commodity that is a bit more heavily controlled,” Mr. Sliwoski said in an interview. “Think of something more akin to tobacco than tomatoes. **Countries have all sorts of funky rules about tobacco with different tariffs on it and I think cannabis would simply be treated like that.** [2]

Second, the competition will be fierce. Contrary to the United States, Canada’s climate is not ideal for outdoor grow throughout the year. Although decreasing, Canada faces higher costs, even if you run an efficient indoor grow. Only CGC, Aphria, Aurora, and Tilray are able to grow in Latin America. Village Farms already is in US. The remainder are forced to seek growing strategies outdoors due to regulatory pressure. [3][4] 

From a general perspective, it costs an average of $100, $233, and $396 to grow a pound of dried cannabis flower in the United States, Outdoors, Greenhouse, and Indoor, respectively [5]. Meanwhile, Canada has discovered low cost outdoor strategies as low as $0.04 at all-cash wholesale, while stockpiling on dried flower, hoping to export as much extract as possible, all the while telling others they’re focused on the consumer experience [6]

Third, Canada has been in multiple violations cited by the international treaty obligations. A U.S.-Mexico-Canada triple threat would cause the UN to have an aneurism. The only  reasonable Avenue that averts this, unless the treaty is modified, is under the Cannabis Act: international policy that promotes the export of cannabis solely for medicinal purposes.

Fourth, and perhaps the death-knell to the bullish argument is the concept of protectionism. Will the United States Federal Government legalize cannabis AND prioritize Canadian and Mexican entry in the US, and piss off the United Nations in the process? Or will they keep to themselves? There’s no fundamental reason to open borders for cannabis while the United States has competitive advantage **and** grow companies big and small in their own back yard - especially with most recent Twitter rampage of competing MSO’s in mind [8]. 

According to Mark Warner, international trade lawyer:

&gt;”Given [cannabis] is such a growth area, the question is whether countries will be tempted to be protectionist about it,” he said. “In other words, will the U.S. say ‘yes, we have legalized cannabis, but we want to keep all the jobs here? That is where it could get tricky.” [2]

Also, Mario Torres, a cannabis lawyer, stated in the cited article:

&gt;”What we have seen from all the drafts in Mexico thus far is they are going to be pretty protectionist in their own cannabis industry... I just don’t know if there is going to be the political will to do anything on the cannabis free trade front. Until you have federal legislation in the U.S. and something concrete in Mexico, it is just way too early to see how trade between the three countries in North America on cannabis would really shake out.”[2] 

After all, the current AMCA is already nit-picky, warranting specificity toward intellectual property rights (I.e. what *kind* of alcohol is exported), what constitutes as fair distribution and exportation, and hosts a pre-existing trade disputes regarding wine and other spirits between the US and Canada. [7]

Long term, the ultimate catalyst may very well be a revision to the USMCA Trade deal. I optimistically believe this will take a maximum of two years, although I personally have a hard time imagining the US federal government rushing to hash the details - especially for cannabis that has been overstocked for months.

**Limitations**

This information is largely comprised of sentiment of paraprofessionals in cannabis, law, and business, with minimal inquiry into the logistical costs to produce in the US and Canada, respectfully. This piece takes little consideration toward the economic impact of Canadian cannabis brands in Mexico and Latin America, especially toward potential trade implications in the future. 

**Suggestion for Further Research**

I also did not speak to the reverse implications of US Cannabis imports to either Canada and Mexico. What may be the implications of US Imported Cannabis onto Canadian LP Revenues?

**Final Thoughts**

Please do your own DD, and discuss new ideas here. I found this information to be helpful (although it does serve my bias) but I am far-and-wide open to evidence for both sides. I’m short-term bearish on Canadian plays until more legal work is completed, and I believe it will take much time to sort out the details. Nonetheless, I hope this serves as a contribution to this sub. 

**TL,DR: Canadian LPs may have a higher cost of entry and time delay associated with USMCA than market euphoria suggests. Canadian companies best not be burning cash when time comes for the borders to eventually open a lucrative, and equally competitive, cannabis trade market in the US.**

This is the biggest lesson I wished I learned before I started my journey - would have saved me a lot of stress and my portfolio would be a bit healthier. 

Why? Because it will determine what type of trades/investments you will be comfortable with.

How? Go look up ""personal financial risk assessment"" and take one of the questionnaires. I like the one that the [University of Missouri](https://pfp.missouri.edu/research/investment-risk-tolerance-assessment/) has put up. 

Everybody is different, but a good reminder that risk, volume, and potential are all correlated. More trades mean more risk, but also higher upside. 

Okay, so what were your results? This is a bit oversimplified but:

+ Day trading - for high risk profiles
+ Swing trading - for medium risk profiles
+ Long term investing / ""buy and hold"" - for low risk profiles

So what does this mean? If you are tolerant of risk, there's r/daytrading r/pennystocks and a whole host of fellow travellers looking to go big or home. 

Low risk? ETFs and big cap stocks. 

Ignoring this is usually why you are unhappy with your portfolio. Low risk traders seeing walls of red because they blindly tailed some shill. Medium risk traders allocating too much of their portfolio to lower risk trades. 

# Due Diligence and Risk

No matter your tolerance for risk, we'd all prefer low(er) risk, high(er) reward opportunities. So how do you reduce your risk? This is where due diligence (DD) comes in. 

**DD is not just random research - there needs to be a specific output**. Generally this is your Price Target.

In order to get there - DD can come in three forms: Technical, Fundamental, Quantitative. Funny enough, we can (loosely) tie this back to our risk profiles. 

The more DD you do, the less risk you incur. That is because Knowledge Is Power. 

Day traders generally rely on technical analysis over everything else. The underlying is less relevant as the price action around it. On the flip side, if you're going to hold onto something for years, you better know what you're buying into. And as such, if you want to try to beat the market by swing trading, be prepared to do a lot of homework. 

## Summary

Of course, people are too complex to put into neat boxes. A low risk trader might want to take a small moonshot at something that looks promising. A high risk trader might gear down after a bad run to protect their capital.

The key is to be honest with yourself with the risk you are taking. Is your decision based on rationality or emotion? How does it fit with your overall strategy? 

Tldr: Find out your tolerance for risk. Use it to guide your trading/investing strategy. Good luck out there.

""As your constituent, I urge you to support efforts to legalize and regulate marijuana for adults in a fair and equitable manner.

It is essential that New York’s marijuana legalization law includes the following core consumer-centric tenets:

The legal option for adults to cultivate personal use quantities of marijuana in private residences;

Reduced barriers of entry for those seeking to participate in the legal adult use marketplace;

Provisions facilitating the automatic review of past criminal records and for the expungement of those records where the past behavior is no longer classified as a criminal offense;

Provisions prohibiting employers from discriminating against workers in the practices of either hiring or firing solely because their off-the-job cannabis use; and

Dedicated funding of social and retroactive justice initiatives through Community Reinvestment Grant fund.

Never in modern history has there existed greater public support for ending the nation's nearly century-long experiment with marijuana prohibition. According to statewide polling data, 65% of New Yorkers endorse regulating the adult use of marijuana.

Please support efforts to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana in a way that ensures safe, affordable, and equitable access for all New Yorkers.""

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: UWM Holdings ($UWMC)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: +1286.9%

Month on Month increase in mentions: +2762%

Average sentiment across mentions: **+21.83%**

**Core Product**

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC’s mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)

**Financials**

UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.

UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.

Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.

Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)

Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to the GME case in short interest (140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)

NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).

**Risk and Competition**

75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC’s refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.

There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don’t completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).

The full impact of UWMC’s CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn’t work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.

**Conclusion**

This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play.

So CRMD was expected to get FDA approval for its Defencath product (basically a catheter valve solution that severely limits the chance of infections)

However, it didn't. FDA declined it, and it's stock fell from $15 to the mid-high $8 as of writing.

Did this absolutely screw my March 19th 15c yes. Did I sell them for a massive loss, yes. But, there is a massive upside for people interested in getting in now (and I still have September 17c, lots).

See, the FDA did not decline the product because it is a bad product, it is clinically proven and the FDA doesn't want anything else in that regard (it's also already approved and in sale in the EU) The FDA had an (undisclosed as of now) issue with the 3rd party manufacturer.

So in my eyes, all the same value in the company is there, it's just the dates that got pushed back. And they have funding to last then into 2022 without diluting. 

The earliest the FDA can have a meeting (due to covid backlog) is April. I think now is a great time to buy shares because once they get approval this thing is worth $30+ easy.

\- They're building Endurance EV betas right now and have multiple showings of these vehicles online providing complete transparency for customers. The inwheel motor concept has been tested for years by their supplier Elaphe, they'll be taking the L1500 motor and tweaking it for their specific truck.

\- The truck is the beginning, they have a van concept in development and a partnership with Camping World for servicing all across America.

**THE TEAM:**

\- CEO is an engineer and has worked for multiple EV startups. The team has worked in high-profile positions for several reputable auto companies, including Tesla.

\- They have 675m in funding with another 200m in government loans in ""advanced talks."" The new Dept of Energy is from Michigan, loves the auto industry, and is ""obsessed"" with bringing clean-energy jobs to likeminded states (Lordstown, Ohio)

\- They have the full backing and support of local politicians, so much so that their local rep fought to overturn the decision to cut government grants for clean energy startups in 2020.

**THE DEMAND:**

\- Production begins September 2021 - they'll have a first-mover advantage in the pickup truck market

\- 100k preorders— average fleet order size of 600 trucks all based on the commercial niche (stickier orders from fleet managers than consumers) They have more preorders than they can make between now and 2022. They are also on the GSA (government) list of approved vendors for vehicles. They don't have the ability to preorder, but demand will be there with the Biden administration.

**THE PRODUCTION:**

\- They bought a 6.2 million square foot plant with all machinery intact from GM for 40 million dollars.

\- In house battery production and access to GMs parts catalog

\- GM is invested and helping them with production as well as Elaphe, their inwheel motor supplier

The only downside I could find is that competitor Eli Lilly just started a phase 3 trial on a new diabetic drug as well that could compete with them. It would seem it is another 18-36 months before this drug would be available.

The biggest reason I see them as long term growth is the data from the Phase 3 Clinical trials of semaglutide as a weight lose drug. The drug is already FDA approved to treat diabetes. It might take 6-12 months to get approved as a weight-loss drug, but this would not stop doctors from prescribing it as an “off-label”.

Remember Farmville? The Facebook video game responsible for your parents divorce because your dad forgot to login and water mommy's corn and gourds? Words with friends, Farmville, Draw Something, and every app you ever downloaded on your first iPod Touch back in '09 was created by Zynga. These guys are the king of microtransactions, ad placement, and app downloads .

Zynga just reported earnings and shares jumped up 7% because the market liked what it saw. Zynga reported record revenue (+52% YoY), record users, record bookings (+61% YoY), record everything. This stock actually only goes up

**Mobile gaming market:**  
Everyone knows gaming is a hot sector. (I'm looking at you CRSR gang). What if I told you that mobile gaming makes up 45% of the gaming market? Everyone has a phone, 6 year olds are even walking around with iPads these days

**Why Zynga?/ MOAT**  
Zynga has been developing apps for over a decade. These guys have brand loyalty, they keep up with the trends and they know what gets downloads. I actually sat in an earnings call for the first time in my entire 3 day trading career and listened to what the company had to say about their future. Taken from the transcript here are some things that stood out to me:

**Brand loyalty**

• *One of Zynga's core competitive advantages is our ability to create forever franchises that are highly engaging and can predictably deliver sustainable growth over long periods of time.* *A great example of this is Words With Friends. In 2020, the franchise delivered its best-ever annual revenue and bookings performance in more than 11 years since its launch in 2009.*

**New titles**  
• *Coming up next from our new game pipeline, are Puzzle Combat and Farmville 3. Both titles have been progressing well in soft launch and are on track to release worldwide in the first half of 2021. We also expect our first Star Wars game to enter soft launch in early summer with the potential to release by the end of the year.*

**Top Downloads/ Expanding into Asia**

• *A key driver of this performance was our growth in Asia, where we continue to enhance our ability to self publish titles including Toon Blast, which was the most downloaded game in Japan on Android in 2020...* *Over the coming years, we see more opportunities to expand into international markets as we execute on our growth strategies*

• *And so far, in Q1, two of our new hyper-casual titles, High Heels and Blob Runner 3D have already reached the No. 1 and No. 2 top downloaded U.S. game positions on Android and iOS.*

• *With our acquisition of Rollic, we ended 2020 with three of the top 50 downloaded U.S. iPhone games.*

**Data and Analytics**

• *At the core of Zynga's live services platform is our first-party data network which captures key insights about how our players are interacting with our games. We use this data to deliver highly engaging interactive experiences for our players optimize our user acquisition and determine how best to monetize our games, including advertising.*

TLDR of that shit: Zynga has popular games, a loyal brand following, and an expansive machine for ad revenue. These guys advertise their other apps, in their own apps. Its like a virus, but one that makes you money

**Astrology:**

I eat crayons, I don't paint with them. But the highly educated people at TradingView seem to think the stars predict good time ahead. I trust them with my savings.

**Risks:**

Any DD that is posted without a risk/deterrent section is just a masturbation tool for whoever posted. I encourage people in the comments to post questions/risks they might see. The biggest risks I see are either a broad market pull back like our perma-bear doomsayers are predicting.

itsabean1,0.0,18.0,"Hello friends. 

I'm relatively new to investing, though I've been trying to learn off and on. The learning curve is steep and I'm definitely struggling. My question is: how do you know when a stock is at its ceiling and you should sell, or if there's still room to go up?

I ask because I've been sitting on 3 (lol) shares of SHOP since 2018. I bought them for $144 and they are now at about 1400 each. I never expected to see that level of gain and honestly when I bought them it was a ton of money for me to invest. But I used Shopify and they were expanding and weed was being legalized in Canada and the articles on them were all bullish so it seemed like as good a pick as any at the time.

My intent was just to keep holding them indefinitely. If they increased this much in three years then how much would I have in five, right? I realized today continual increase is not necessarily a given, and $1400 is actually quite a lot for a single share to be valued at. (I think?)

So, hence my question. How do I figure out if there's potential for the stock to continue to grow, or if I should take my gains and reinvest? DDs are far beyond my level as are a lot of things that go into them, so I appreciate any pointers on where to look and how to understand!

3d_abraham,0.0,17.0,"Hey, I wanted to cover Astra a rocket company which recently had a merger with HOL.

Holicity
- HOL raised 275 million when it went public last year. As part of the deal with Astra, Holicity will funnel about $300 million into the company, and up to $200 million will be brought in from funds managed by BlackRock. This gives Astra a valuation of more than $2.1 billion when the transaction is complete. 

Astra 
- Is a small launch vehicle company that was founded in 2016 by Chris Kemp and Adam London. Astra attempts to carry small satellites or spacecrafts into any part of the Earths orbit using a dedicated small launch rocket for both commercial and military uses. Astra is looking to build rockets at scale and wants to launch rockets monthly, weekly and even daily. Astra fell just short of reaching orbital velocity by 0.5 Km on its latest test launch in December, although Kemp considers it a success and said “The hardware on this system performed flawlessly through the entire flight,” and “This far exceeded our team’s expectations.”  Astra plans commercial launches by this summer, monthly launch at years end and daily launches by 2025. At this point they have 50 launches currently booked and $150 contracted some of which are from NASA and US military. 

Competition 
- The biggest competition to Astra would be Rocket lab and Virgin Orbit which has yet to reach space. I don’t think Space X would be considered a direct competitor as their rockets are much larger scale. Rocket lab (not public) is the furthest along in launching of satellites into space with their electron rocket, they were recently able to launch a communication satellite for a German company on Jan 20th of this year. If there’s a problem I see with the Astra technology here, it’s that their rockets are not reusable like that of Rocket Lab or Space X. But if they can manufacture rockets at scale and use materials that allow them keep costs low I don’t think there should be a problem. 

Market
- Space is an emerging market and there is a lot of room for new companies in this industry to grow. This can be seen with Virgin Galactic a company with no revenue and a lot of hype being currently valued at market cap of 12 billion. I believe Astra which also has a long way to go but possesses a much better business model and fills a growing need should be poised for long term growth.",stocks,DD on Astra (HOL),17.0,0.89

Say you have a company you buy in at $10.
You see hype and the stock is going up, it's now at $12. You think the hype will push it higher maybe to $13 but not quite to the moon like the hype seems to be talking about.

Is this a situation where if you bought 100 shares at $10 you could then sell a call option of say $15 to also lock in gains from the premium?

Is this also then the essential idea of ever buying a call option? A hope for upward moves but still a plan to sell because you honestly don't even believe it will be 'in the money'?? Of course if you sell that means someone bought believing it would be or even higher of course.

Just wondering about this type of trade strategy. Buying enough shares at a price you like and selling options at a higher price to gain a premium on top of any gains you've made (by having the shares already I'm assuming this means you removed all risk of the stock skyrocketing but of course you lost all those extra unrealized gains by being forced to sell your tendies)

However I came across this [recent article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-stockpiles-chips-chip-making-210000407.html) that says China is stockpiling chips and machines to make them to combat potential US sanctions and be self-reliant.  The logic follows that China should weather the chip shortage better than other countries, and that would mean their EV companies should see no slowdown.

Given the recent sell-off and China's resilience to the global chip shortage, now could be a great time to invest in Chinese EV companies.  I don't have a case of any one company over the other, so investing in all of them or an ETF should be fine.

The new S-1 revealed new financials about Coinbase's business, including the fact that its revenue figure topped $1 billion in 2020. Coinbase further noted that it had 2.8 million ""transacting customers"" on its platform as of the end of 2020, compared with one million at the end of the past year.

Coinbase has been conducting secondary offerings on Nasdaq ahead of its direct listing. Last week, The Block reported that as of the almost recent secondary offering, the firm's implied valuation stood at $100 billion.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

&gt; * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

&gt; # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week

&gt; * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

&gt; # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

&gt; * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

&gt; * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

*****

&gt; # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results

&gt; * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

&gt; * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

*****

&gt; # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

&gt; * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

&amp;#x200B;

\-- **Share Facts --**

* **Fastly, ticker FSLY**
* **Earnings date:** Just released, next earnings date May-5th (IIRC, don’t quote me on this one)
* **Market Cap:** $9.16 B
* **Fastly stock price movement:** Down to $80, from $110-$115 last week. Despite being in line with analyst expectations, their guidance for growth is less than expected, and maybe the incoming lawsuit is causing concerns for some (more on that later, and why I think the lawsuit is inconsequential - more on this in the risk section).
   * Despite the recent drop, the stock price is up roughly 350% YoY

&amp;#x200B;

**-- My position --**

* On Monday 22nd, I will do a Bull Spread expiry April-16th, $90/$95, 10x contract. Based on Friday’s close, cost of entry per contract is $129, or $1,290 total. Max profit is $3,710. I’m further financing this bull spread with 2x CSP, 1x at $70 strike and 1x at $60 strike, for a total premium of $528.
   * Final position: Bull Spread with cost of entry of $762. Max profit of $4,238. Max loss of $762 + potentially assigned at $70 and $60 - If that were to happen, I’d sell CC on the stock, although if my timing turns out to be wrong and the market disagrees for too long with me, I might exit my position, I’m not opposed to that idea.

&amp;#x200B;

\-- **The DD --**

**What does Fastly do?**

Fastly is in the Internet Infrastructure industry, and is first and foremost built with developers in mind, and their winning approach has quickly given them important market share over the last few years. They are a global Content Delivery Network (CDN). They have built a better approach at speeding up the internet based on location of data centers, but also through optimized hardware and enhanced security protocols. CDN and Fastly’s offerings are increasingly vital in the cloud era, as speed and security matters.

To put things in perspective, they have 2020 annual revenues of roughly $291 million, versus a total addressable market that Fastly sees as being $35 billion.

**Recent acquisitions:**

They have acquired Signal Sciences for $775M in cash and stock, back in H2 2020. This acquisition is a strategic one to expand Fastly’s security portfolio.

* **Signal Sciences:** Directly from Fastly’s press conference: “The transaction combines Signal Sciences’ powerful web application and API security solutions with Fastly’s edge cloud platform and existing security offerings to form a unified suite of modern security tools. This robust new security portfolio, designed for the way developers work, unlocks innovation at the edge and removes silos between developers, operations, and security teams to shorten development cycles and protect websites and web applications alike.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Straight from February 17th earnings call:**

**Q4 2020:**

* Revenues of $83 million (net of $2 million deferred revenue writedown), which represents a 40% YoY growth.
   * **Estimates were at a growth of $82 million, so slightly beat expectations**
* Gross margin of 59.2%, up from 56.7% in the same quarter last rear.
   * Non-GAAP gross margin (excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets) is 63.7%, up from 57.6% in the same quarter last year
* Cash position of $216 million (blend of cash, restricted cash and investments)
   * They used approximately $200 million cash to acquire Signal Sciences earlier in the year, a non-recurring item that had a significant impact on cash position. Despite that, they are cash-rich, which gives them a strong ability to further invest in growth
* Net retention rate of 115%, which is pretty phenomenal. This means that net revenue from existing customers increased by 15%
* Customer growth: 37 new customers to content delivery (1.81% - Not fantastic), and 11 new enterprise customers (3.51% - enterprise clients are the highest-spending category of clients)

&amp;#x200B;

**Annual:**

* Revenues of $291 million, which represents a 45% YoY growth
* Gross margin of 58.7%, up from 55.9% for 2019
   * Non-GAAP gross margin is 60.9%, up from 56.6% for 2019

&amp;#x200B;

**2021 Outlook:**

* For Q1 2021, they expect revenues in the range of $83 million to $86 million, non-GAAP losses ranging from $14 million to $10 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share ranging from $0.13 to $0.9
* For the full year 2021, they expect revenues in the range of $375 million to $385 million (28.87% to 32.30% growth), non-GAAP losses ranging from $50 million to $40 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share ranging from $0.44 to $0.35

Margin-wise, we can see an improvement not only for the year, but also for the latest quarter. They are tracking in the right direction, especially considering the quarterly growth is higher than the yearly growth (non-GAAP growth of 10.59% for the quarter, versus 7.60% for the year)

&amp;#x200B;

**What now?**

Sure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young-ish, and still in growth mode. That being said, if growth begins to slow, we should expect them to slowly transition into a profitable company. Margins are improving, so hopefully this will happen over the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the risks?**

* Back in October 2020 Fastly dropped by about 25% on announcement that they were getting a reduction in business from its largest customer, TikTok (about 12% of revenues back then). So that projected loss of revenue from this specific client is already priced in. As a result, they had a decreased revenue guidance of 3.5% to 8.0%. Considering the stock had been on a meteoric rise (about 580% growth YoY prior to that October 2020 announcement), I think a 25% pullback was entirely natural.
* What happened on Friday, February 19 2021 is related to this; when Fastly made that announcement and the stock dropped by 25%, a bunch of vulture law firms started class action lawsuits against Fastly for failing to disclose it properly, as any law firm lacking self respect would do. The investigation has now been initiated. What are the potential consequences of this, I have no clue. Hence why it’s a risk.
   * I’m not personally too worried about this, because class action lawsuits against companies always happen the moment a share drops significantly (it recently happened with Slack when they issued guidance that was less than what analysts expected, and this didn’t stop Salesforce from buying them). Also, personally my play is a short-term one of two months, and I do not see too much of a short-term impact from this. See the press release [here](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/fastly-investigation-initiated-former-louisiana-035000107.html).
* It’s a competitive market, so if you are in this for the long run, you need to keep track of Fastly’s continued ability to innovate, to win new clients, and to have strong retention rate (which right now is at 115%). Margins are improving, but pricing battles could eat into them
* As growth slows, it's obviously important to monitor for a transition to profitability. If you see slowing growth, and stagnant margins, then it would be cause for concerns

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Fast growing company, has not disappointed in terms of results. While we cannot expect the same kind of growth, this is not a growth play for me - Rather, I see this as a play on what I believe is an extreme market reaction to a slightly lower growth guidance than expected, combined with the TikTok-related lawsuit. This is not a long call kind of play for me, but more of a bull spread to minimize my cost of entry in case the market disagrees with me for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer: NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL.

&gt; BofA estimates that the transition towards 100% electrification could require over $2.5 trillion of investment around the globe over the next decade.

In the same article, BofA determined that only $6 billion so far has been raised where particular EV startups are concerned.

There has been [scaremongering in this very subreddit regarding this very subject](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kvirkw/psa_this_is_a_good_time_to_be_skeptical_of_ev/).  However, even Jim Cramer has come around to the potential for this gold rush.

Indeed, eight months have made a crucial difference for retail investors, courtesy of reverse mergers.

There have been great ones and terrible ones. Even among the great ones (i.e., with hype), there have been the cookie-cutter kinds of great ones, and then there are the best ones, the blockbuster events.

In eight months, exactly eight blockbuster events have been fully realized: Nikola (NKLA), Hyliion (HYLN), Velodyne Lidar (VLDR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), ChargePoint (future CHPT), QuantumScape (QS), Stem Inc. (future STEM), and Lion Electric (future LEV).

In fact, one of them, Stem Inc. (future STEM), has just had the second-best-ever ""IPO pop"" before ticker change.  Such ""IPO pop"" is second only to [that of Hyliion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-revenue-no-problem-wall-street-rushes-into-electric-car-and-truck-startups-11603286077):

&gt; [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit. The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [reverse merger company] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.

&gt; “I had invested in Hyliion on pure hype—literally pure hype,” Mr. Denton said. “I knew nothing about the company.”

&gt; He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.

Momentum trading during late last year, and also during the early part of this year, showed that the rest of 2021 has the potential to change all that and add more tickers.  The rest of 2021 has the potential to apply the Hyliion Strategy.

First up is what could become the [world's largest electric bus maker by 2026: Arrival](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkkqbp/worlds_largest_electric_bus_maker_by_2026_arrival/).

Then I bought the pullback. Then waited. And waited. Bought some more. 

Then it spiked up to $45, then another lower high to $39. Then ER and the total beatdown.

UnBonCitoyen,0.0,19.0,"This is my more extensive DD about this boomer stock, I will repeat a few things from my other DD [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll3sq2/why_shell_rdsa_is_undervalued/).

First of all, yes this isn’t a very exciting EV stock (or is it?) and it won’t make you rich overnight BUT it won’t make you go bankrupt and it has some potential.

HISTORY:
The pandemic hit this stock pretty hard (60$ -&gt; 25$). Why? Pure stupidity. The company didn’t change, it kept producing ENERGY. You had completely delusional people who were thinking that Shell will go bankrupt lol (everyone with an IQ above 50 doesn’t need an explanation to see that this is retarded). Others were/are thinking that Shell is a pure oil company and that oil is something from the past. From their point of view, we will live in a completely different world without plastics, without non-EV, without pills (yes you need oil to make pills, medication) etc. Aka they are also delusional.
The REAL REASON why the stock price plunged: they cut the dividend.

BUT on the other hand, they announced that they will increase the dividend each year with at least 4% AND they will buy some shares back as soon as their debt is bellow 65 billion. (I think they might also increase the dividend even more when they reach this target, the stock price will go up in each case) “Shell outlined a long-term plan to reduce debt to $65 billion and to aim for shareholder distributions of 20-30% of cash flow” [link](https://www.oedigital.com/news/482818-ceo-says-shell-s-oil-production-peaked-in-2019)

WHY WILL THEY HAVE LESS THAN 65 BILLION DEBT IN THE VERY NEAR FUTUR

Look at those oil prices!! 13 month high!! They will keep going up!! [link](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Hedge-Funds-Flocked-To-WTI-Crude-Ahead-Of-Texas-Cold-Snap.html) [link](https://www.pennlive.com/life/2021/02/gas-prices-at-highest-in-a-year-and-expected-to-increase-more.html)
Shell has a break even price of 31$ per barrel, this means that they make 32$+ PROFIT per barrel with a Brent oil price of 63$+. 
Shell produced about 920k barrels per day in Q4 2020 aka during the second big worldwide lockdown aka worst case scenario [link](https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2020/shell-fourth-quarter-2020-update-note.html)
So what does this mean? They are making a fuck ton of money and they will reach the 65 billion debt very soon.

Shell is a ENERGY stock, NOT just oil.
Shell also produces hydrogen and natural gas (LNG).

You know what’s also at a 12 month high? That’s right, gas!!! [link](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-futures-called-higher-as-severe-cold-brings-chaos-to-u-s-energy-markets/)

EXTRA HIGH natural gas and oil prices because it’s extremely cold and refineries are closing, it can take several weeks to get them fully operational again [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-u-oil-refinery-shutting-180345565.html)

SHELL will become a carbon neutral company by 2050 [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56022908)
They will gradually make this change, this is healthy for the company. Here is a non exhaustieve list of what this change implies:
-Shell acquired UK’s largest EV charging network [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubitricity-m-a-shell-idUSKBN29U0TC)
-This is a huge one: Shell made synthetic kerosene (aka carbon neutral!!) and it worked!!! [link](https://news.klm.com/world-first-in-the-netherlands-by-klm-shell-and-dutch-ministry-for-infrastructure-and-water-management-first-passenger-flight-performed-with-sustainable-synthetic-kerosene/)
-Shell has it own electric scooter! [link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210216006045/en/Lotus-International-Company-Partners-With-Shell-to-Extend-Its-Brand-Into-E-Mobility-With-the-New-Shell-RIDE-E-Scooter)
-Shell opens first hydrogen refuelling station of H2Benelux in Amsterdam [link](https://www.waterstofnet.eu/nl/nieuws/shell-opens-first-hydrogen-refuelling-station-of-h2benelux-in-amsterdam)
... and the list goes on

Important note about the ticker:
You can trade the stock at AEX (Amsterdam), GBX (London) and NYSE. There are two types of shares, A and B. Each type has its own tax regime (only for the dividend) so you need to do your own research to  see which regime is the most beneficial for you. This might be quite complicated but in the end it has a small impact so you shouldn’t worry about the difference if you’re not planning to buy a lot of shares.

TLDR:
Oil and gas prices are at a 12 month high -&gt; stock goes up

I've been watching this company make major moves since it was beat down last year in July when it was below $3 then reached a high of $42.60 on Jan 7th. 

Last year the company has made lots of acquisitions including pk2labs , GridFabric , and ATL Data Centers LLC for Bitcoin Mining.  This company has been hot in the news dropping good news a few times a month constantly keeping investors informed on their projects and developments.  

**My Positive Highlights:**

*  The Company's management team forecasts a revenue increase exceeding 100% for the Year-Over-Year Revenue Improvement for the Third-Consecutive Year. (December 2020)
*  The company is implementing Bitcoin as part of it's business.

* They are clearly innovative and expanding aggressively by looking at it's past history in building a wide variety of products and investments.
* The company taps into the EV market through the GridFabric software.

**My Negative Highlights:**

* The company is still not profitable.
* There a lot's of completion such a Bloom Energy (BE) 
* They could be growing too fast and result in a company decline.

dbxyz,0.0,18.0,"Rubicon Technology (RBCN) is a relatively forgotten stock. Extremely low volume, low float, small market cap.

I was turned onto this stock by my financial planner. He did not give me much background so I did some digging today before taking a starter position of 225 shares at $10.95.

Rubicon is a manufacturer of sapphire products for optical systems and specialty electronic devices. Think cell phone screens. Their products have applications in consumer electronics, aerospace, semiconductors etc.

They do not do huge business only approximately $5mill revenue for 2020, but they only have a $26mill market cap.

Here is the interesting thing. They ran at a net loss for the 9 months ending Q3 of ($696k), but they are sitting on over $10mill in cash/equivalents and $14mill plus of short term investments (treasuries). 

About two years ago they acquired another company called Direct Dose RX. Direct Dose Rx is a specialized pharmacy that provides prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs and vitamins to patients being discharged from skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and directly to retail customers who want such medications delivered to their home. The delivered products are sorted by the dose, date and time to be taken and come in easy to use perforated strip-packaging as opposed to separate pill bottles.

This business currently makes up about 20% of Rubicon's total revenue. The pharmacy business has grown over 250% in Q3 2020 vs. Q3 2019 and over 400% in the 1st 9 months of 2020 vs the first 9 months of 2019. It is obviously a growing segment and they are currently only licensed in 11 states.

Now Rubicon is focused on diversification and increasing stockholder value and is sitting on $25mill in cash/investments.

In a press release on Dec 16th the CEO announced a $3mill share buyback to take place over the next 2 years. "" In our opinion, shares of Rubicon’s common stock are currently trading at a discount to its intrinsic value and it is a good use of our capital to repurchase our common stock at favorable prices""

The release also mentioned: ""Rubicon is also exploring various alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including potentially through acquiring an existing business, establishing a new venture, or other investment opportunities""

With RBCN's pharmacy business growing larger by the quarter and their assets outweighing their market cap by 20% I see an opportunity for growth here. I expect higher than anticipated earnings from their pharmacy business when we get Q4 earnings. 

With such a low float and small market cap, a little volume can really get this ticker moving. I want to be in before they announce whatever their next move might be. 

With such a low cap, this could also be ripe for some type of reverse merger. Possibly something medical related where the pharmacy arm stays and the Sapphire business gets split off, similar to what happened with AMRH/Jay Pharma.

Just food for thought. I am not a financial expert and I generally have no idea what I'm doing.",stocks,DD for Rubicon Technology RBCN,18.0,0.85

My question is, which one to buy based on the merger deal? If I understand it correctly, APHA's investors will own about 64% of the combined stocks, and looking at the market cap of the companies, they're both at roughly the same level.

My reasoning is that if theoretically the market caps  (of the two companies) were the same, and APHA's shares would account for 64% of the combined total, then it would be better to buy APHA, right?
